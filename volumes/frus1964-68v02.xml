                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States series</hi> presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the Foreign Relations series. The staff of the Office of the
                    Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the
                    volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the
                    generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations
                    codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the
                    series were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March
                    26, 1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <pb xml:id="pg_IV" n="IV" facs="0004"/>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                    Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity
                    and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating
                    in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should
                    omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing
                    should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute
                    also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>The statute also requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to provide
                    comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions of the
                    U.S. Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and
                    other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the Department of State
                    Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign
                    policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in
                    editorial or bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume, which was originally compiled in 1984 and 1985 and
                    revised and updated in 1993 and 1994, are convinced that it meets all
                    regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p>An explanation of the selection policy for the series and of this particular
                    volume and a detailed description of the sources available to the editors of the
                    series as well as a list of specific files consulted for this volume follow this
                    preface.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. In planning and preparing
                    the 1964–1968 subseries, the editors chose to present the official record of
                    U.S. foreign policy with respect to Vietnam in seven volumes. Volume I documents
                    U.S. policy toward Vietnam during 1964. Volume II (presented here) documents the
                    period from January 1, 1965, through June 12, 1965. Volumes III through VII
                    document the following periods: III, June 13, 1965, through December 31, 1965;
                    IV, 1966; V, 1967; and VI and VII, 1968.</p>
                <p>These seven volumes focus on Vietnam. They do not record activities in the rest
                    of mainland Southeast Asia except as they may relate immediately to the conduct
                    of the war in Vietnam. U.S. relations with Laos are documented in Volume XXVIII.
                    U.S. relations with Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> are documented in Volume XXVII.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, <pb xml:id="pg_V" n="V" facs="0005"/>and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and assists with any access
                    and/or clearance problems that arise. Time constraints prevent the Advisory
                    Committee from reviewing all volumes in the series.</p>
                <p>This volume has not been reviewed by the Advisory Committee.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The declassification review of this volume resulted in the decision to withhold
                    .03 percent of the documentation originally selected; no documents were withheld
                    in their entirety. The documentation provides an accurate account of the main
                    lines of U.S. policy toward Vietnam during the January 1–June 12, 1965
                    period.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the Department of State declassification review
                    of the documents published in this volume. The Declassification Coordination
                    Division of the Historian's Office coordinated the interagency and foreign
                    government declassification review. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in
                    editorial or bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria
                    in accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards
                    of scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <pb xml:id="pg_X" n="X" facs="0010"/>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Documentation that illuminates special decisionmaking processes that
                    accomplished the policies recorded in particular volumes;</p>
                <p>15. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scope and Focus of Documents Researched and Selected for
                    Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, Volume II</p>
                <p>The editors developed the following six areas of focus for research and the
                    selection of documents for inclusion in this volume: 1) formulation of policy in
                    Washington, with particular emphasis on the series of decisions that led to the
                    commitment of major ground forces to Vietnam; 2) the advisory process, including
                    recommendations from key advisers in Washington, intelligence assessments of the
                    situation in Vietnam, and reporting and advice from U.S. officials in Saigon; 3)
                    efforts to negotiate a settlement to the Vietnam conflict, and other key
                    diplomatic contacts; 4) military planning and strategy; 5) the relationship
                    between the United States Government and the South Vietnamese Government,
                    including the issue of political instability in South Vietnam; and 6) the
                    implementation of policy in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, <pb xml:id="pg_XI" n="XI" facs="0011"/>rather
                    than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to
                    the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was
                    drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
                    included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained
                    as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted from this volume because
                    it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been delineated.
                    All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy decisions and
                    actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government agencies,
                    departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. The editors believe that in terms of access this volume was
                    prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of this statute, although
                    access to some records was restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p>The editors have had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts.
                    Intelligence-related files maintained by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have access
                    to these records for future volumes; if any documentation relevant to this
                    volume is found, it may be included in a subsequent volume.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the
                    National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
                    Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Agency, and the United
                    States Information Agency. All of this documentation has been made available for
                    use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent
                    of these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The Department of State has arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    that are held at the Johnson Library. The first audiotapes became available to
                    the editors in late 1994, with most audiotapes, including those for the year
                    1965, to follow during 1995 and 1996. The editors decided not to delay
                    publication of this volume, <pb xml:id="pg_XIV" n="XIV" facs="0014"/>but if
                    relevant records are found among these telephone conversations, they may be
                    included in a later <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Secretaries of Defense and their major
                    assistants and the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The editors of this
                    volume also had access to the Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">William Westmoreland</persName> at the U.S. Army Center of Military History
                    and the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, the Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> at the National Defense
                    University, the Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Harold
                        Johnson</persName> at the U.S. Military History Institute, and the Files of
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John T.
                        McNaughton</persName> at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those records
                    still in the custody of that Agency. Department of State historians' access is
                    arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.
                    Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue
                    to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of this access, and the variety
                    of documentation made available and selected for publication in the volumes has
                    expanded. The editors of this volume made particular use of the files of
                    Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John
                        McCone</persName> and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRN1">Richard Helms</persName>.</p>
                <p>The following are the particular files and collections consulted and cited in
                    this volume.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Subject-Numeric Indexed Central Files</hi>. In February 1963,
                    the Department of State changed its decimal central files to a subject-numeric
                    central file system. The subject-numeric system was divided into broad
                    categories: Administration, Consular, Culture and Information, Economic,
                    Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each of these divisions were
                    subject subcategories. For example, Political and Defense contained four
                    subtopics: <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> (Politics), <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> (Defense), CSM (Communism), and INT

                        <p>2014. Crisis between government and military is deepening with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> taking harder and
                            more advanced positions amounting to insistence on formal military
                            control of entire government structure.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister sent his son Tran Van Dinh to see
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> late yesterday evening to brief us on
                            situation and express his deep concern, and <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            also saw Minister of Interior <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> this morning. Both of us have asked to see the
                            Prime Minister this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Tran Van Dinh said the Prime Minister was persuaded that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s purpose in taking over was,
                            together with Buddhists, lead country to a neutralist solution.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Dinh</persName> indicated his father was
                            thinking of the possibility of a “coup de force” by elements of the army
                            against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> discouraged such concept which would
                            result in fratricidal strife between elements of the armed forces and
                            stated it seemed to him problem of the government was to bring other
                            generals around to point that they would tell <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> that he was finished and in
                            this way avoid possibility of strife between armed forces elements.
                            During <persName>Johnson</persName>'s call on <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> this morning <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said that he and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> had spent New Year's
                            eve and part of New Year's day at IV Corps with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and number of other high
                            officers. They had held no formal meeting, but <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> during “interrupted discussions” with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and others had learned enough
                            of generals' plans to alarm them.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_2" n="2" facs="0034"/>
                        <p>What really concerned <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName>,
                            however, was that generals now appear to have gone beyond December 20
                                action<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">The dissolution of the High
                                National Council.</note> and to want even more. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and number of other officers
                            said they wanted to create new military body to be called “organ of
                            control” (giam sat). This body, to be established at or above chief of
                            state level, would give military control over civilian government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had made very clear
                            that it was not to serve as government's advisory organ for military
                            affairs, but to have rather opposite function. Initially (New Year's
                            eve) military had said that body would have no civilian members; next
                            morning, however, they intimated that they might envisage some civilian
                            membership but it was clearly still to be under military control.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said military even
                            possibly envisaged letting office of chief of state be merged with new
                            organ, but said military would have authority. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said that in response to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s observation that
                            this “would prevent coups”, he said government acceptance of this would
                            be “the coup.”</p>
                        <p>In response to <persName>Johnson</persName>'s questions, <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CANG1">Cang</persName> had argued most heatedly for new
                            organ, with other generals appearing less enthusiastic. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said he had impression that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CANG1">Cang</persName> in particular was
                            behind proposal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> stated that he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> had pointed out to
                            military that neither chief of state nor Prime Minister could create
                            such new body. Suggested that military wait two or three months for
                            establishment of National Congress and then make their proposal to
                            Congress. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had rejected
                            this, saying that military wanted to establish this new organism soon in
                            order to “give maximum stability to government.” Admitted that
                            government now in provisional status, but indicated that provisional
                            status could last longer. Establishment of National Congress could wait
                            for five or six months. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName>
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s main concern
                            now seemed to be to create organ of control, not to establish Congress.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said he considered
                            matter “very serious.”</p>
                        <p>In reply to question, <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said
                            that during discussion of new organ there had been no allusion to US
                            role; re issue between Ambassador and military,<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had expressed strong
                                opposition to the dissolution of the High National Council in
                                conversations with certain Vietnamese military leaders on December
                                20, 1964, and with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> on

                            <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said he had impression that
                            this was on road to resolution.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> asked whether <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> believed that new body would be intended by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to lead towards
                            negotiated solution possibly including neutralization. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> replied in rather vague fashion,
                            saying that he <pb xml:id="pg_3" n="3" facs="0035"/>had impression from
                            whisperings among Buddhists and others that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might be thinking about
                            neutralization. Noted particularly whisperings to effect that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would not let himself be
                            subjected to foreign (i.e., US) control. Also pointed to activities of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s brother-in-law Phan
                            Quang Tuoc who, <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said, had
                            returned to Saigon around December 17 from trip to Hong Kong, Paris, and
                            perhaps Germany. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> observed
                            that Tuoc had close liaison with Buddhist Institute.</p>
                        <p>Long exchange developed over what to do next. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said he knew of nothing in
                            particular which US could do to assist government right now, but would
                            let us know. Said he would see Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> later to chart next steps.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> thought Prime Minister
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> would call in <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> early next week in order to get
                            clear statement on record of what <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> wants. In response to
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>'s suggestion, agreed it would be good idea
                            to invite other generals also. He thought that Prime Minister and

                            to “confront generals with their responsibility”; would tell them to

                            with changed membership, would also indicate that government not

                            suggested it was desirable that issue be presented in clear manner and
                            resolved as quickly as possible. From the hardening of the military
                            position it no longer appeared that the passage of time was contributing
                            toward finding a compromise solution. Suggested that if <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> insisted on demand for control
                            organ, <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> might say that in
                            this event he would have no alternative but ask <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> to relieve <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in accordance with provisions
                            of the charter. This would present other generals with clear issue of
                            whether to support government or publicly to take position of
                            insubordination. <persName>Johnson</persName> did not know how generals
                            would react but issue would have been clearly posed. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said he thought Prime Minister's
                            position might be “more flexible”. Said government had no power to
                            enforce decision to relieve <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. When <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that
                            government could resign, and observed that he had impression most
                            generals did not want this to happen, <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> said that Prime Minister did not want to give
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> chance to take power
                            by default by government resignation. Intimated government might prefer
                            force military take over by coup d'etat. Later hinted, however, that
                            government might retire if <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and generals did not agree to what Prime Minister
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> would present to them at
                            their meeting. <persName>Johnson</persName> said he thought that issue
                            of new control organism was <pb xml:id="pg_4" n="4" facs="0036"/>strong
                            one for government. <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> agreed
                            that issue had to be clearly presented, adding that in present situation
                            it was impossible for government to operate and this was increasingly
                            reflected in attitudes of provincial officials.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">In telegram 1381 to Saigon, January 2, the Department

                            the way through. The most important thing it says is that our personnel
                            policies in Vietnam are wrong. The Army is running it in a regulation
                            way, and that means that we have too much staff, too much
                            administration, too much clerical work, too much reporting, too much
                            rotation, and not enough action. (I was an Army staff officer for three
                            years, so this is not just imagination.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> are probably the ablest
                            regulation officers we have, but that is not what we need, and in any
                            case much of the <pb xml:id="pg_5" n="5" facs="0037"/>trouble is here in
                            Washington, which sets the policy on rotation and reporting and other
                            forms of paper work.</p>
                        <p>For reasons that are not clear to me, Bob McNamara has always been
                            hesitant about going behind the regulations on this side of the matter.
                            But today I found him more responsive than ever before.</p>
                        <p>It may be that a real push from you would produce quite new results on
                            the military side now.</p>
                        <p>It is true that Bob is very much opposed to larger U.S. forces. But when
                            I asked him why, it turned out that what he is against is more of the
                            overhead and administration and general heaviness that the attached
                            report describes. I think he would be responsive to an instruction to
                            develop a new plan for volunteer fighting forces that would proceed with
                            a minimum of overhead and a maximum of energy in direct contact with the
                            Vietnamese at all levels. At the very least it is worth asking him. We

                            have an anti-U.S. bias and, by its victory, lend encouragement to the
                            anti-American manifestations already evident in Buddhist and certain
                            student groups.</p>
                        <p>Except as an admirable show of courage, we see nothing to be gained by
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s proposed action. If
                            there is any hope of resolving the present crisis, it seems to us that
                            continued patient and determined <pb xml:id="pg_7" n="7" facs="0039"/>efforts to bring <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> around
                            or to separate <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> from the
                            rest of the generals still presents the most advantageous course—as
                            difficult and frustrating as this must be for both the Embassy and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. As unpalatable as
                            the present arrangement is, a forceful removal (and possibly the arrest)
                            of <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> would be even worse.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Bob McNamara called this morning on other matters, and I asked him
                            what he thought of the State of the Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> delivered
                                his Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union at 9:04
                                p.m. on January 4, 1965. For text of the address, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                                    Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book I, pp. 1–9.</note> He said
                            he liked it, but had one worry. He wonders whether the statements on
                            Vietnam on pages 6 and 7 are too strong in the light of our current
                            policy. I said that they were no stronger than things we had said a
                            dozen times before, but I gathered from Bob that he thought they were
                            stronger than our actions. I get the implication that he fears that if
                            we do not intend stronger action, we may regret these sentences.</p>
                        <p>2. My own view is that, whatever we may decide to do on particular
                            matters in the coming months, it is absolutely essential to maintain a
                                <pb xml:id="pg_8" n="8" facs="0040"/>posture of firmness today. I
                            believe that without firm U.S. language, the danger of further erosion
                            in Saigon is bound to grow. I therefore not only approve, but strongly
                            recommend, the language on pages 6 and 7. Nevertheless, I think you
                            should know Bob's worry.</p>

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_DeSoto1">DeSoto</gloss> Patrol: Mr. Forrestal said
                            that this question would be suspended until the 9 January meeting for a
                            review in connection with the overall scale of operations. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that he
                            expected considerable trouble from Congress if we were to send
                            destroyers into the Gulf of Tonkin on a regular basis. He said <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will come up with some alternate
                            thoughts. In this connection, it was pointed out that the intelligence
                            from <gloss target="#t_DeSoto1">DeSoto</gloss> Patrols is useful but not
                            compelling and it would only require one patrol every six months or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>4. It was suggested that a general checklist of increases in the scale of
                            operations against North Vietnam be worked up preparatory to the 9
                            January meeting, to include such matters as Barrel Roll, 34–A, <gloss target="#t_DeSoto1">DeSoto</gloss> and reprisals. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that the signal
                            Hanoi is receiving may not be the one we intend. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> made the point that the
                            basic signal Hanoi seems to have received is that the U.S. decided not
                            to go north after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s trip to the United States.</p>

                        <p>6. Third Country Aid: The attached memorandum<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">Not attached and not further identified.</note> was circulated on
                            the status of this program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> and Mr. Forrestal questioned whether Saigon was
                            ready to receive substantial third country contingents, especially on
                            the civilian side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>
                            also suggested the desirability of an orientation program for third
                            country representatives coming to Vietnam, to be mounted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with U.S. support. Mr. Forrestal will
                            look into this.</p>
                        <p>7. Binh Gia: General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> gave
                            a detailed rundown of the Binh Gia operation<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">In the Binh Gia engagement near Saigon early in January 1965 the
                                Viet Cong killed nearly 200 South Vietnamese soldiers.</note>
                            commenting that the piece-meal commitment of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces seemed to be the main cause for the results. He
                            said the action did not necessarily indicate any move to a new stage of
                            Viet Cong combat, although there were indications of uniformed and
                            steelhelmeted Viet Cong troops. The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>
                            commented that the attached analysis<note n="6" xml:id="d6fn6">Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_CGA1">Carver</persName> to
                                the Deputy Director for Intelligence, January 5, on “The

                            indicate a move to Stage III. There was then an inconclusive discussion
                            on the effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations
                            and intelligence on the enemy, it being stated that both have reasonably
                            improved. However, there is considerable leakage of operational
                            information to Viet Cong intelligence, both through their special
                            intelligence and ordinary intelligence operations. The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> suggested that a review be made of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> desertion <pb xml:id="pg_10" n="10" facs="0042"/>rate in recent weeks and the causes for this
                            increase. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> indicated some
                            surprise and will look into this matter. The <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> again suggested attention to the effectiveness of the
                            psychological effort on the South Vietnamese people and commented that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss>, seemed to be unduly tied down by his
                            U.S. press briefing responsibilities. Mr. Forrestal will look into this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>8. In parting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                            commented that he hoped that the Mission in Saigon would not push
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> into a vigorous fight
                            with the Young Turk Generals. It was agreed that this would be
                            unfortunate and that the cautioning notes given the Embassy on this
                            should be continued.</p>

                        <p>1. Your 5485–64 year end wrap up of Washington view on Vietnam was very
                            helpful, especially the reasons why our recommendations for action get
                            turned down.</p>
                        <p>2. I have always deferred to Westy and Amb <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s views on retaining dependents in Vietnam
                            because I felt they were best judge of danger to dependents and
                            advantages of keeping them in country. Your message introduces a new
                            factor into this problem.</p>
                        <p>3. If we are still operating under policy of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 314<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">For text, see ibid., pp.
                                758–760.</note> and if presence of dependents is a block on decision
                            for action, then I think we should move dependents out <gloss target="#t_ASAP1">ASAP</gloss>. Realize there are other factors
                            which influence decision makers even if dependents moved, but other
                            factors you mention are less of a positive block. Decision to move
                            dependents should include all, not just military. Since movement of
                            dependents takes considerable time, we cannot wait until we are ready to
                            take offensive action before initiating dependents withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>4. Brink bombing<note n="4" xml:id="d8fn4">See <ref target="#d9fn11">footnote 11, Document 9</ref>.</note> once again demonstrates
                            that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have capability to attack
                            dependents any time. Seems entirely possible Saigon could lapse into
                            state of lawlessness under current lack of government control. So,
                            movement dependents justified for other reasons than to facilitate
                            decision for U.S. action.</p>
                        <p>5. Announcement of removal dependents should be carefully worded and
                            timed to get most political mileage. Might mention continued unstable
                            political conditions; let them wonder if all U.S. personnel would soon
                            depart.</p>
                        <p>6. As you know, we are ready to take reprisal action on short notice, if
                            that is required. I recommend against including <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> in the first strike. They can follow on after Westy
                            gets them cranked up, but they should not be allowed to hold up our
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>7. On another subject. I concur completely with <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>'s assessment of how Barrel Roll is influencing the

                            was passed to us. We will have to make a good sized strike on a
                            reasonably important target before the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will know that we are doing anything different.</p>

                        <p>1. In replying to your <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>-64375, rather
                            than to compose a single cable which would be overly cumbersome by its
                            length, it has appeared preferable to prepare a basic cable presenting a
                            coherent report of our views on the overriding issues in <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>-64375 and to supplement it additionally
                            by four supporting sections each addressed to one of the four specific
                            suggestions contained in para 7, reference A. This is the basic cable
                            which undertakes to evaluate the present situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, to analyze the causes of our troubles
                            and to indicate what we can and cannot do to eliminate or attenuate
                            these causes and closes with our recommendations. We have not repeated
                            herein our views contained in the related cable, <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2010.</p>
                        <p>2. A description of the present situation needs little amplification
                            beyond the content of Emb cables filed since the military coup de force
                                <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0045"/>(the current phrase here) of
                            December 20, read against the background of the report which I made to
                            you and senior officials in Washington in early December. We are faced
                            here with a seriously deteriorating situation characterized by continued
                            political turmoil, irresponsibility and division within the armed
                            forces, lethargy in the pacification program, some anti-US feeling which
                            could grow, signs of mounting terrorism by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> directly at US personnel and deepening discouragement
                            and loss of morale throughout <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Unless these conditions are somehow changed and trends reversed, we are
                            likely soon to face a number of unpleasant developments ranging from
                            anti-American demonstrations, further civil disorders, and even
                            political assassinations to the ultimate installation of a hostile govt
                            which will ask us to leave while it seeks accommodation with the
                            National Liberation Front and Hanoi. How soon these developments may
                            occur is hard to estimate. Some might take place tomorrow—anything like
                            a coalition govt is unlikely for several months. In all, however, there
                            is a comparatively short time fuse on this situation.</p>
                        <p>3. When one looks for the causes of this unhappy state of affairs, they
                            fall generally under three heads: lack of a stable govt, inadequate
                            security against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and nation-wide
                            war-weariness. All three are interdependent and react upon one
                            another.</p>
                        <p>4. Until the fall of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the
                            experience gained from the events of the following months, I doubt that
                            anyone appreciated the magnitude of the centrifugal political forces
                            which had been kept under control by his iron rule. The successive
                            political upheavals and the accompanying turmoil which have followed
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>'s demise upset all
                            prior US calculations as to the duration and outcome of the
                            counterinsurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and the future
                            remains uncertain today. There is no adequate replacement for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in sight.</p>
                        <p>5. At least we know now what are the basic factors responsible for this
                            turmoil—chronic factionalism, civilian-military suspicion and distrust,
                            absence of national spirit and motivation, lack of cohesion in the
                            social structure, lack of experience in the conduct of govt. These are
                            historical factors growing out of national characteristics and
                            traditions, susceptible to change only over the long run. Perhaps other
                            Americans might marginally influence them more effectively but generally
                            speaking we Americans are not going to change them in any fundamental
                            way in any measurable time. We can only recognize their existence and
                            adjust our plans and expectations accordingly.</p>
                        <p>6. The lack of security for the population is the result of the continued
                            success of the VC subversive insurgency for which the foundation was
                            laid in 1954–55 and which has since grown to present proportions of an
                            estimated 34,000 main guerrilla force supported by some 60–80,000 local
                            guerrillas. Not only is this a large and well-trained force but it <pb xml:id="pg_14" n="14" facs="0046"/>enjoys the priceless asset of a
                            protected logistic sanctuary in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            and in Laos. I do not recall in history a successful anti-guerrilla
                            campaign with less than a 10 to 1 numerical superiority over the
                            guerrillas and without the elimination of assistance from outside the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>7. Obviously neither condition obtains in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. With regard to relative manpower, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military-paramilitary-police forces
                            during the last two years have enjoyed only a little over a 5 to 1
                            advantage in spite of gaining in strength some 165,000 in the same
                            period. Thus, if there is any validity in the 10–1 superiority
                            requirement, in spite of high losses <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            strength and a maximum effort to increase <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, there is no likelihood of reaching a
                            satisfactory strength relationship now or at any time we can foresee
                            under current procedures. Nor does it seem reasonable or feasible to
                            look to US or third country sources to fill the manpower gap. (See
                            Section V.)</p>
                        <p>8. The ability of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to regenerate
                            their strength and to maintain their morale is to an important degree
                            the result of infiltration from the logistical sanctuaries outside the
                            country and from the sense of support and confidence this gives them.
                            You have doubtless seen the recent study of infiltration<note n="7" xml:id="d9fn7">For text of the study of infiltration dated October
                                31, 1964, see ibid., pp. 864–872; regarding a report on Aggression
                                From the North, released on February 27, 1965, see <ref target="#d171">Document 171</ref>.</note> which estimates a
                            total infiltration of 34,000 since February, 1960, and points to the
                            possibility of 10,000 infiltrators in 1964. While there is much chance
                            for error in such figures, infiltration is an important source of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> recuperative powers.</p>
                        <p>9. Apart from inadequate forces and frontiers open to infiltration, the
                            inability to give <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> adequate security
                            is a by-product of the weakness of govt already discussed. Effective
                            pacification calls for an intricate blending of military, economic,
                            social and psychological resources which, thus far, has exceeded the
                            capability of the changing Saigon govts. The Hop Tac experiment<note n="8" xml:id="d9fn8">Hop Tac (Working Together) was a campaign begun
                                in mid-1964 by the South Vietnamese Government, at the urging of
                                    <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, to pacify the area around
                                Saigon.</note> is producing some encouraging results but the
                            country-wide pacification program as a whole has a long time to go—years
                            in fact—before we can hope to bring security to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by present methods and at current rates of
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>10. The third cause of the present situation, war-weariness, is easy to
                            understand. It grows out of 20 years of uninterrupted conflict with the
                            Japanese, the French, the religious sects and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It has increased as the result of disappointed hopes
                            following the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and the failure of the heralded new revolution. It exists more in the
                            cities and among the intellectuals than in the provinces among the
                            peasants and soldiers. The only cause for surprise is that morale is not
                            worse than it is. <pb xml:id="pg_15" n="15" facs="0047"/>There is a
                            toughness in the countryside which is a very encouraging phenomenon. One
                            cannot escape the feeling that there is nothing in the psychological
                            situation here which a few victories, military or political, could not
                            turn around.</p>
                        <p>11. If these are the causes—unstable govt, lack of security and
                            war-weariness—the next question is what we can do to eliminate or modify
                            these factors and thus change the situation for the better, bearing in
                            mind that we have limited time. Some things we clearly cannot do—change
                            national characteristics, create leadership where it does not exist,
                            raise large additional <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces or
                            seal porous frontiers to infiltration. If one accepts such limitations,
                            then it is equally clear that in the time available we cannot expect
                            anything better than marginal govt and marginal pacification progress
                            with continued decline of national morale—unless something new is added
                            to make up for those things we cannot control.</p>
                        <p>12. Thus, we are faced with considering what we can do. We can probably
                            compromise the current governmental crisis in a way which will salvage
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> but will leave him
                            pretty much under military domination. If <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> goes, he will probably be followed by some kind of
                            military government. If it is controlled by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, we will have to do hard
                            soul-searching to decide whether to try to get along with him again
                            after previous failures or to refuse to support him and take the
                            consequences—which might entail ultimate withdrawal. If we can mislay
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and get a military
                            chief of state like <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName> or
                                <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>, we have a fresh option
                            worth trying. But whether a jerry-built civilian government under
                            military domination or a brand new military government, it will not get
                            far unless a new factor is added which will contribute to coalescing the
                            political factions around and within the government and thus bolster its
                            position.</p>
                        <p>13. To speed pacification, we could consider increasing the U.S. support
                            by increasing the advisory effort or by adding combat units. With regard
                            to the first possibility, during the last year we have already increased
                            our advisory effort by 42 percent. The increase has taken place at
                            several echelons and has involved not only the military but <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> representation as well. In the military sphere, the
                            positioning of advisory teams at district (county) level and the
                            augmentation of battalion teams account for most of the increase.
                            Americans are now advising all elements of the regular forces down to
                            battalion and a very large part of the paramilitary forces. Americans
                            are also flying all manner of fixed and rotary wing aircraft, and are
                            operating an extensive communications system. By February 1 there will
                            be 23,700 officers and men in country; and, in addition, approximately
                            750 civilian advisors. We believe that our capability to stiffen
                            further, by advisory means, is very limited; indeed, we have probably
                            reached about the saturation point.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_16" n="16" facs="0048"/>
                        <p>14. The introduction of U.S. ground units to help fight the Viet-Cong is
                            still another question. To take this decision would in effect change the
                            basis of our conduct of the war. This is in itself no argument against
                            such a change, but for the reasons discussed in Section V, we are still
                            of the opinion that we should not get into this guerrilla conflict with
                            our ground units.</p>
                        <p>15. In the search for some course of action which will help pull the
                            government together, stimulate pacification and raise the morale, I can
                            find only one which offers any chance of the needed success in the
                            available time. This is the program of graduated air attacks directed
                            against the will of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, referred to
                            in reference B as Phase II.<note n="9" xml:id="d9fn9">Phase II
                                operations referred generally to graduated military actions against
                                infiltration routes in Laos and eventually North Vietnam.</note> The
                            purpose of such attacks would be fourfold: (1) convey to Hanoi the
                            message that it will become increasingly costly to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>; (2) eventually create a situation
                            favorable to talking with Hanoi; (3) turn <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> attention from internal feuding to attacking the
                            external source of their troubles; (4) restore U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> camaraderie through a joint military
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>16. I know that this is an old recipe with little attractiveness but no
                            matter how we reexamine the facts, or what appear to be the facts, we
                            can find no other answer which offers any chance of success. The other
                            choices are to continue as we are, making marginal improvements and
                            hoping for the best, to open negotiations with enemy, or to withdraw.
                            Nobody on the spot here believes that any one of these will result in
                            ought but loss of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and eventually of
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. It is true that our recommended
                            course of action offers no certainty of success and carries some risks.
                            We are presently on a losing track and must risk a change. How long it
                            will take to arrive at a denouement if we do not change I cannot say but
                            to take no positive action now is to accept defeat in the fairly near
                            future. Furthermore, the action required goes beyond any mere
                            improvement, necessarily limited, in what we have been doing up to now.
                            The game needs to be opened up and new opportunities offered for new
                            breaks which hopefully may be in our favor. The new breaks may also be
                            unfavorable but scarcely more so than those we have been getting thus
                            far.</p>
                        <p>17. I have shared your feeling that a stable government in Saigon should
                            be a prerequisite to our undertaking offensive action against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. As stated in reference C, the minimum
                            criteria of performance which should be met include the ability of the
                            government to speak for and to its people, to maintain law and order in
                            its principal cities, to make plans for the conduct of operations and
                            assure their effective execution by military and police forces
                            completely responsive to its authority. The present <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> government does not reach this
                            standard primarily <pb xml:id="pg_17" n="17" facs="0049"/>because of the
                            uncertain responsiveness of the armed forces to its commands. We will
                            make every effort in adjusting the present governmental crisis to
                            encourage legitimate participation by the armed forces in the government
                            and an acceptance of a degree of responsibility for it. We have some
                            leverage on the generals in the form of the increased aid which I was
                            authorized to discuss with the government upon my return from Washington
                            last month. The most important single item in the package is the matter
                            of joint planning in contemplation of Phase II operations. My present
                            authority permits me now to initiate planning for Phase II with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with the understanding that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not commit itself to any form of
                            execution of such plans. Actually, because of the recent climate of our
                            relations, we have not initiated this planning and should not until we
                            are surer of our future course of action. It would be of great
                            assistance in reaching a compromise of the present crisis if I were
                            authorized to state explicitly to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            leaders that we are prepared to initiate Phase II operations in case the
                            new government meets or shows reasonable promise of meeting your
                            criteria. What I am suggesting is undertaking a conditional commitment
                            that if, in the U.S. judgement, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            reaches a certain level of performance, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will join in an escalating campaign against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Hopefully, by such action, we could
                            improve the government, unify the armed forces to some degree, and
                            thereupon move into the Phase II program without which we see little
                            chance of breaking out of the present downward spiral.</p>
                        <p>18. With regard to your feeling that this guerrilla war cannot be won
                            from the air, I am in entire agreement, if we are thinking in terms of
                            the physical destruction of the enemy. As I conceive it, the Phase II
                            program is not a resort to use bombing to win on the Douhet theory<note n="10" xml:id="d9fn10"> Giulio Douhet (1869–1930) was an Italian
                                military theorist and proponent of strategic air power and strategic
                                bombing.</note> (which I have spent considerable past effort in
                            exposing) but is the use of the most flexible weapon in our arsenal of
                            military superiority to bring pressure on the will of the chiefs of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. As practical men, they cannot
                            wish to see the fruits of ten years of labor destroyed by slowly
                            escalating air attacks (which they cannot prevent) without trying to
                            find some accommodation which will exorcise the threat. It would be to
                            our interest to regulate our attacks not for the purpose of doing
                            maximum physical destruction but for producing maximum stresses in Hanoi
                            minds.</p>
                        <p>19. Thus far I have not specifically discussed reprisal bombing in
                            response to some major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> atrocity such
                            as the Bien Hoa attack or the Brink bombing.<note n="11" xml:id="d9fn11">On October 31, 1964, the Viet Cong attacked Bien Hoa airfield with
                                mortars, killing 4 U.S. servicemen and wounding 30. On December 24,
                                1964, a bomb exploded at the Brink Hotel in Saigon, killing 2 and
                                injuring 50 people.</note> I gather that the decision not to react
                            to the Brink affair <pb xml:id="pg_18" n="18" facs="0050"/>resulted from
                            a combination of considerations such as the political turmoil in Saigon
                            at the time, the initial uncertainty as to the authorship of the job,
                            the feeling that the local security had left something to be desired and
                            that, when all considerations had been taken into account, too much time
                            had elapsed to warrant making a reprisal. Without undertaking to discuss
                            each one of these points, I would say that the problem looks quite
                            different here than from Washington. If we are so unfortunate as to have
                            another atrocity warranting consideration of reprisal bombing (and I
                            feel sure that we will), we think this event should be viewed as an
                            opportunity to strike <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> appropriately
                            which should be welcomed. It would not only signal Hanoi but would give
                            the local morale a much needed shot in the arm and should dampen <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> enthusiasm for terrorism especially
                            against Americans and thus aid in protecting our people. If, as is
                            usual, the investigation to ascertain the facts takes some days, that
                            delay should be no bar to retaliation. Our intent will be perfectly
                            clear when we act and the advantages derived therefrom will be
                            unaffected. We think here that our policy should be to retaliate
                            promptly after receiving Presidential approval for each case. To justify
                            a reprisal, the stability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (or
                            lack thereof) at the time appears to us to have much less importance
                            than in the case of the deliberate initiation of Phase II bombing.</p>
                        <p>20. The matter of the evacuation of dependents is closely linked to the
                            foregoing considerations. Because of its importance and your personal
                            interest in it, I have given it separate treatment in Section II which
                            follows. In brief, the study concludes that the flow of dependents
                            should be stopped now. Numbers presently here should be reduced by
                            administrative measures but the order to evacuate all dependents,
                            because of its political impact, should await a decision to execute a
                            retaliatory strike against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or to
                            initiate the Phase II program.</p>
                        <p>21. If the foregoing reasoning is generally accepted, then we should look
                            for an occasion to begin air operations just as soon as we have
                            satisfactorily compromised the current political situation in Saigon and
                            set up a minimal govt in accordance with the procedure of para 17. At
                            the proper time, we can set the stage for action by exposing to the
                            public our case against infiltration, and by initiating aggressive
                                <gloss target="#t_DeSoto1">DeSoto</gloss> patrols. We can be ready
                            with prompt reprisal bombing in response to further <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism. As an earnest of our intent,
                            we can open joint planning with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            against the North and stop the flow of our dependents. When decided to
                            act, we can justify that decision on the basis of infiltration, of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism, of attacks on <gloss target="#t_DeSoto1">DeSoto</gloss> patrols or any combination of the
                            three.</p>
                        <p>22. In conclusion, I would request authority to act in accordance with
                            para 17 in order to establish as soon as possible a govt meeting the
                            minimum criteria for justifying the extension of air strikes against the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in accordance with the Phase II
                            concept. In the meantime, I would hope that, regardless of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> performance in respect to the criteria,

                                    Document 477</ref>.</note> I fully understand and appreciate
                            your concern with respect to the problem of dependents. As we see it
                            here, there are two aspects to this—first, the actual physical danger to
                            the dependents themselves and, secondly, the psychological effects both
                            on our friends here and on the enemy of a decision to withdraw them.
                            Although no one can exclude the possibility at any time of accidental or
                            deliberate injury being inflicted upon some of our dependents, for the
                            moment I am most concerned with the latter problem, that is, the
                            psychological effects on our friends and enemies.</p>
                        <p>Immediate withdrawal in the present atmosphere would, I am certain, be
                            interpreted both here and in Hanoi and Peking as a sign of weakness and
                            desperation which could result in panic among our friends and great
                            encouragement to the enemy. (It would also adversely influence our
                            ability to obtain third country assistance from our less sturdy
                            friends.) However, if the withdrawal is directly related to other action
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, it can, if properly
                            handled, be used to reinforce the tonic effects such action will have
                            for our friends and the seriousness of purpose that we will desire to
                            communicate to the enemy. I have, for example, in mind the successful
                            way in which we used the evacuation of our dependents from Guantanamo
                            during the Cuban crisis to reinforce the signals that we were seeking to
                            communicate to both Havana and Moscow.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_20" n="20" facs="0052"/>
                        <p>At the same time, I entirely agree that until the time comes that we want
                            to use mandatory withdrawal of dependents to reinforce wider action we
                            are taking elsewhere, we should seek to do all we can to reduce the size
                            of the problem. We have already done much to reduce their numbers by
                            voluntary and administrative action. For some time <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> has hired no new personnel with small
                            children. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has also been reducing
                            the number of positions requiring two-year tours and thus, under present
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> policy, the presence of
                            dependents if desired by their sponsor. All the agencies have also
                            informally discouraged the bringing of dependents and encouraged the
                            voluntary return of those already here. However, we can, and subject to
                            your own thoughts, I propose to do much more.</p>
                        <p>We could have all agencies immediately initiate a policy of not
                            permitting newly assigned personnel or those returning from home leave
                            to be accompanied by their dependents. We could also initiate a policy
                            of encouraging the advanced departure of dependents whose sponsors are
                            scheduled to leave Viet-Nam permanently or on home leave orders in the
                            next few months. Additionally, all the agencies represented here could
                            take a harder look at their staffing patterns to see whether staff
                            members, particularly those with dependents, could be reduced without
                            impairing our effectiveness. All of this will inevitably result in some
                            publicity but I think that this is manageable.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the remaining dependents, I would propose that at the
                            time we initiate a retaliatory strike against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or initiate Phase 2 action against the
                            North we simultaneously announce and undertake an evacuation of all
                            remaining dependents. I suggest that such an announcement should be
                            carefully timed in relation to whatever else we will publicly be saying
                            at the time. I believe that an orderly evacuation of the remaining
                            dependents could be carried out at that time over a period of say seven
                            to ten days with minimum personal hardship and risk to them and without
                            the seriously adverse effects of doing it before that.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, if at any time civil disorders in Saigon or other
                            developments indicate an imminent and serious risk to dependents, I will
                            have no hesitancy in ordering their immediate evacuation.</p>
                        <p>All of my principal colleagues strongly agree with the foregoing views
                            except Jim Killen who, while recognizing the political problems of
                            immediate evacuation, favors a complete evacuation initiated now phased
                            over perhaps a two-month period.</p>

                                    Document 477</ref>.</note> Since receiving your <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>-64375, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and his staff have made a
                            comprehensive study of the requirements for giving maximum security to
                            U.S. personnel and facilities by utilizing U.S. guards and units. He
                            arrives at the startling requirement of 34-battalion equivalents of army
                            or marine infantry, together with the necessary logistic support. He
                            considers that the total manpower requirement would approximate 75,000
                            U.S. personnel.</p>
                        <p>The reason for this high figure is basically the large number of
                            installations in which we have important U.S. interests. They total 16
                            important airfields, 9 communications facilities, one large <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage area, and 289 separate
                            installations where U.S. personnel work or live. Any one of these is
                            conceivably vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack in
                            the form of mortar fire or sabotage; and any are vulnerable to attack by
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ground forces. To keep mortar fire
                            off any given point, one must secure an area roughly 16 square miles (a
                            circle whose radius is 4,000 yards, the maximum range of 81mm mortar).
                            Thus large airfields would, in the opinion of General <hi rend="italic">Westmoreland</hi>, require up to 6 battalions of U.S. ground
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Even with such a commitment of U.S. forces, there would be no absolute
                            guarantee against clandestine sabotage or covert mortar attacks. With
                            few exceptions, critical installations are located in or near towns or
                            cities, or in heavily populated farm land. In most of these areas, it is
                            neither practical nor politically feasible to clear away a 4,000
                            yard-wide belt that could be controlled by U.S. forces. Consequently,
                            U.S. troops would be faced with discharge of guard mission within
                            populated areas and would lack the authority as well as ability to
                            control the movements of population and to execute the search and
                            seizure procedures required by such a mission. It is likely that such an
                            effort to give greater security to our people would bring us into
                            greater conflict with the Vietnamese people and government.</p>
                        <p>In connection with guarding U.S. personnel billets and dependent
                            quarters, we are presently conducting a detailed survey of requirements.
                            Under present arrangements, the main burden for security rests upon the
                            Vietnamese police and military services, and we believe that
                            responsibility <pb xml:id="pg_22" n="22" facs="0054"/>should remain
                            theirs. However, we have concluded that an additional U.S. military
                            police battalion is required in Saigon area to augment the Vietnamese in
                            order to raise the level of security provided.</p>
                        <p>Over the past several months and in view of the foregoing considerations
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has
                            initiated or has recommended taking the following actions:</p>
                        <p>A. An increase of the Vietnamese armed forces by approximately 80,000 and
                            the National Police by 10,000 in 1965 in order to provide, among other
                            things, additional forces for the protection of U.S. installations.</p>
                        <p>B. A long series of unilateral U.S. measures such as the dispersal and
                            revetment of U.S. aircraft, the provision of sandbag personnel shelters
                            where appropriate, provision of additional air and military police for
                            close-in security of U.S. aircraft on major airfields, the augmentation
                            of marine security elements to reinforce company strength for close-in
                            protection of aircraft at the Danang airfield, and the emplacement of
                            counter-mortar and ground surveillance radar near certain sensitive
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>C. Persuasion of the Vietnamese military to take complementary steps, to
                            include the clarification of command responsibility for airbase defense,
                            the emplacement of additional artillery and mortar batteries at certain
                            airfields, and the establishment of better intelligence systems,
                            particularly around key installations.</p>
                        <p>We have no illusions that when the foregoing measures have been taken, we
                            will have created complete safety for our installations and for our
                            people. However, we consider that, on balance, our present plans to
                            increase the size of the armed forces of Vietnam, to improve their
                            combat effectiveness, and, in conjunction with an expanded police force,
                            to maximize their contribution to pacification are preferable to the
                            commitment of a large number of U.S. security forces to static guard
                            missions in South Vietnam. We believe that the current program will, in
                            the end, produce that degree of security which is reasonably
                            attainable.</p>

                            have leaned heavily on <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex
                                Johnson</persName>, assisted by the political section of the
                            Embassy, to respond to your comments with regard to the need for a much
                            wider and more varied attempt to get good political relations with all
                            Vietnamese groups. In his opinion, there is no country in the world in
                            which we have more extensive or deeper communication with the local
                            population as well as the govt than here. Between the Emb and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officers, we have some 45
                            French-speaking and 10 Vietnamese-speaking officers whose primary duty
                            is maintaining such communication. They have literally hundreds of
                            contacts with every important walk of Vietnamese life. Although we would
                            not suggest your reading its entirety, I do believe it would be
                            interesting for you to turn the pages of <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1836<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d448">Document 448</ref>.</note> to get an impression
                            of the extent of our contacts with various political groups.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            contacts, through our integrated <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs, we speak
                            by radio, moving pictures, pamphlets and newspapers to the broad mass of
                            the people. Through the Voice of America, which is very extensively
                            listened to here, particularly in times of crisis, we communicate
                            selectively the views of the US and the world press.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we have unusual ability to reach the armed forces of
                            Vietnam and provincial officials through the hundreds of US military
                            officers and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> field reps who are in
                            intimate and daily contact with their Vietnamese counterparts. They are
                            linked together by a US communications system which allows us very
                            quickly to pass them appropriate guidance on current matters. We have
                            been using them extensively in the current crisis to make known the US
                            position.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, the quality of our personnel in Vietnam is high and I
                            believe they meet pretty well your description of “sensitive, persistent
                            and attentive Americans.” We could perhaps improve on our use of them
                            but we definitely do not need more. The Vietnamese may even be somewhat
                            smothered now by the quantity of US contacts.</p>
                        <p>In our use of these contacts, there are two aspects of communications
                            with the Vietnamese which we must bear in mind—the long term <pb xml:id="pg_24" n="24" facs="0056"/>and the short term. The long term
                            is directed toward influencing the basic attitudes and characters of the
                            Vietnamese people. The short term is directed against working with these
                            Vietnamese as they are today in order to accomplish our immediate
                            purposes. No amount of persuasion or communication is going to make them
                            other than what they are over the short term. Nothing that anyone can
                            say in the short term is going to change their deep-seated suspicions
                            and fears of each other, their political fragmentation and their lack of
                            any true sense of nationhood. The French background and education of
                            most of the elite have caused them to absorb some of the less desirable
                            French characteristics in this regard and, in addition, given them a
                            certain schizophrenia, being torn between the native Vietnamese and the
                            French cultural backgrounds. Thus, they have no single frame of
                            reference in which to react to events—hence the seeming volatility of
                            their attitude and the lack of firm principle to guide their
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>With such an unstable audience, the question is what to say in order to
                            influence them in the direction of US policy. No doubt with greater
                            experience we can become more effective, but our overriding problem is
                            the inability up to now to give them any hope for an eventual end to
                            their tribulations imposed by 20 years of war. In the absence of a light
                            at the end of the tunnel, they tend to blame us rather than themselves
                            for the continued darkness.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the foregoing sounds as if we were saying that we are
                            doing as well as possible in this vital area of political relationships.
                            Rather I would say we do not see how additional reinforcements would
                            help us to do better and that this is not an area in which likely
                            improvement offers a hope of reversing the declining situation. The
                            gains here are likely to be for the long term whereas our immediate
                            problem is to change a situation which is very much with us now.</p>
                        <p>In order to assure yourself that we are missing no real bets in this
                            political field, would you consider sending someone like <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName> here for a few weeks to look
                            at this particular field? I think of Mac particularly because of his
                            perceptiveness in such matters and the fact that he has been physically
                            detached from the local scene and hence would have an objectivity which
                            an old Vietnamese hand would lack. I can think of no one from the
                            outside who could give you a better first hand report on this
                            subject.</p>

                                    Document 477</ref>.</note> Following is an analysis by Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and his staff
                            in which I concur, regarding the feasibility of stiffening the armed
                            forces of Vietnam by introducing U.S. and possibly third country ground
                            combat forces (Special Forces, Rangers, Marines, etc.).</p>
                        <p>1. With regard to an increase in U.S. advisory effort, we have gone about
                            as far down the advisory route as it is practical to go without passing
                            the point of clearly diminishing returns. At the present, there are a
                            total of 5,100 military advisors within <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, extending thru all echelons from the high command down
                            to battalion and to district (country) level. During the past year the
                            advisory effort measured in terms of manpower has increased by 42 per
                            cent. In addition, there are at present approximately 18,000 U.S.
                            military personnel involved in operational support of various types.
                            Although certain increases and adjustments will be periodically
                            required, the air, helicopter, logistic and communication support
                            provided or planned by the U.S. services is generally consistent with
                            the size of the total force. However, there are some areas, treated
                            later, in which increased U.S. participation and support are
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>A. The only significant area where it appears that an addition to advisor
                            effort might be warranted would be at the district level. Advisors are
                            just now arriving for the last of 113 districts. Initial evaluation
                            clearly indicates that the district advisory program is sound and is
                            paying off. If momentum can be maintained another 25 of the regular
                            five-man teams could be used by early summer and will be requested.</p>
                        <p>B. Our current thinking is that Special Forces teams might be utilized as
                            advisors in remote and least secure districts—perhaps up to 25 more in
                            all.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to the use of U.S. or Allied combat ground forces beyond
                            the deployments programmed under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            plans and other existing war plans, several alternative concepts have
                            been considered:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. First Alternative:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Concept</hi>: U.S. (or Allied) airborne, Marine and
                            infantry battalions under U.S. command and control to provide reserve
                            striking forces capable <pb xml:id="pg_26" n="26" facs="0058"/>of quick
                            reaction to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks and offensive

                            bases.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Forces</hi>: We considered both a high and low option
                            and the details have been developed for each. In summary, the high
                            option with 25 bns would provide U.S. quick reaction forces at each of
                            the 9 divisions and certain general reserves. The low option with 8 bns
                            would provide reserves in each of the 4 corps zones. In either case,
                            U.S. air forces and logistical troops are included. The high option
                            would total 60,000 troops—the low option 20,000.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi>: Reaction to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks would be under de facto U.S. control, thus
                            increasing the likelihood of rapidity and aggressiveness. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties would increase.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Disadvantages</hi>: U.S. would be directly involved in
                            ground combat. It is inevitable that casualties would occur among
                            Vietnamese noncombatants, thus creating adverse reaction by Vietnamese
                            against U.S. which <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would strongly
                            exploit. Command relationships would be difficult. The Vietnamese Army
                                (<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>) might tend to leave the
                            tougher problems to U.S. troops and thus gradually abdicate its
                            responsibilities. U.S. casualties would be high.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Second Alternative:</p>
                        <p>Concept: Integration of ground combat battalions into <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> infantry regiments.</p>
                        <p>Forces: In summary, 31 infantry battalions plus combat and service
                            support troops as well as U.S. fighter and transport squadrons would be
                            required. Total force would approximate 66,000 personnel.</p>
                        <p>Advantages: Each <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> regiment would
                            have a trained hardcore U.S. combat unit to lead the way and set the
                            standards.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages: U.S. troops would be under the command of Vietnamese
                            officers. As in the first alternative U.S. troops would be engaged in
                            populated areas with many political problems stemming from noncombatant
                            casualties and the appearances of a white man's war against the brown.
                            Again <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> could develop a tendency to
                            hold back, leaving the U.S. battalions to do the bulk of the fighting.
                            U.S. casualties would be high.</p>

                            difficult to obtain or sustain. It may also be difficult to confine the
                            force to such an enclave in the face of guerrilla attacks which would
                            require ever extending defensive actions beyond the perimeter

                        <p>3. In weighing the advantages and disadvantages, only the last
                            alternative appears to be acceptable but none is recommended at this
                            time.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_28" n="28" facs="0060"/>
                        <p>A. It may seem as though we have weighted too heavily the political
                            problems associated with the introduction of U.S. ground forces.
                            However, after much soul searching we have reluctantly concluded that
                            their military value would be more than offset by their political
                            liability. The Vietnamese have the manpower and the basic skills to win
                            this war. What they lack is motivation. The entire advisory effort has
                            been devoted to giving them both skill and motivation. If that effort
                            has not succeeded there is less reason to think that U.S. combat forces
                            would have the desired effect. In fact, there is good reason to believe
                            that they would [have] the opposite effect by causing some Vietnamese to
                            let the U.S. carry the burden while others, probably the majority, would
                            turn actively against us. Thus intervention with ground combat forces
                            would at best buy time and would lead to ever increasing commitments
                            until, like the French, we would be occupying an essentially hostile
                            foreign country.</p>
                        <p>B. We have reviewed the tactical operations of the past two years for
                            occasions where employment of U.S. ground forces would have been
                            desirable and feasible. We have found such instances to be few and far
                            between. On balance, they do not seem to justify the presence of U.S.
                            units, even disregarding the political problems involved.</p>
                        <p>C. We are not prepared to recommend that U.S. troops be placed under
                            Vietnamese command and thus reject the second alternative.</p>
                        <p>D. While the military/political enclaves have some attractive features
                            they will not contribute in large measure to the counterinsurgency war
                            and could be political and financial liabilities.</p>
                        <p>4. Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>A. That we adhere to the advisory system improving and expanding it as
                            necessary. Additional district advisors will be required if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presses on with the war.</p>
                        <p>B. That the U.S. continue to provide only operational support along
                            current lines augmented and reinforced as the situation requires.</p>

                            I would say that time is starting to heal the rawness of relations which
                            resulted from the events of the week of December 20. For the moment, at
                            least, there seems to be no danger of a knock-down confrontation between

                            some describe it. However, there is certainly no room for complacency in
                            assessing the outcome of this particular engagement. In its simplest
                            terms, it was the piecemeal commitment of government forces against a
                            well organized Viet-Cong task force which had picked its battlefield and
                            had prepared itself carefully for the ensuing actions. The government
                            forces arrived on the scene battalion by battalion and took the
                            inevitable losses of a piecemeal commitment into battle in the presence
                            of the enemy. The losses on our side presently include about 200 killed
                            in action, 190 wounded and almost a hundred missing. This includes 16
                            U.S. losses (5 killed, 8 wounded and 3 missing). <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are claiming 140 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            killed.</p>
                        <p>This action was a serious defeat but not a disaster, and the consequences
                            should not be overstated. However, it is a reminder of the distracting
                            effect upon military actions of the continuing immersion of the generals
                            in politics. Had the senior generals not been closeted during this
                            period in Vung Tau plotting against the <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> government, I am quite <pb xml:id="pg_30" n="30" facs="0062"/>sure that the leadership of the action would have been
                            of a higher quality and the outcome might have been quite different.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere the progress in pacification as in recent weeks was almost
                            undetectable. The effects of the political impasse in Saigon gradually
                            are making an appearance in the provinces. Civilian officials, in
                            particular, are uncertain how to act and normally follow their
                            instinctive tendency toward timidity when there is not a clear voice of
                            authority to direct them.</p>
                        <p>The general public is strangely unaware what is taking place. Because of
                            the double censorship in Saigon, first by the government and second by
                            the military, the news is not being published in the local press.
                            Although the word is gradually seeping out that there is a conflict
                            between the civilian <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>
                            government and the military, no one seems to be particularly agitated or
                            anxious to take sides on behalf of either party. An exception are the
                            political monks of the Buddhist Institute who are taking advantage of
                            the opportunity to renew their harassment of the government.</p>

                        <p>For your meeting this afternoon with the President,<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">See <ref target="#d17">Document 17</ref>.</note> and
                            even though Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            incoming messages have not been released by the President except to
                            yourself and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, I thought
                            it might be helpful to have notes prepared among Mike Forrestal,
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Len Unger</persName>, and myself.</p>
                        <p>1. I think we must accept that Saigon morale in all quarters is now very
                            shaky indeed, and that this relates directly to a widespread feeling <pb xml:id="pg_31" n="31" facs="0063"/>that the US is not ready for
                            stronger action and indeed is possibly looking for a way out. We may
                            regard this feeling as irrational and contradicted by our repeated
                            statements, but Bill Sullivan was very vivid in describing the existence
                            of such feelings in October,<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">Presumably a
                                reference to comments <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> made during consultations in Washington in
                                October. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> had been
                                serving as an assistant to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> since the summer of 1964. He was appointed
                                Ambassador to Laos on November 25 and presented his credentials to
                                the Royal Lao Government on December 23.</note> and we must honestly
                            concede that our actions and statements since the election have not done
                            anything to offset it. The blunt fact is that we have appeared to the
                            Vietnamese (and to wide circles in Asia and even in Europe) to be
                            insisting on a more perfect government than can reasonably be expected,
                            before we consider any additional action—and that we might even pull out
                            our support unless such a government emerges. We have not yet been able
                            to assess the over-all impact of the continuing political crises and of
                            the Binh Gia military defeat,<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">See <ref target="#d14fn5">footnote 5, Document 14</ref>.</note> but there
                            are already ample indications that they have had a sharp discouraging
                            effect just in the last two weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. By the same token, it is apparent that Hanoi is extremely confident,
                            and that the Soviets are being somewhat tougher and the Chinese
                            Communists are consolidating their ties with Hanoi. All three have
                            called for a Laos conference without preconditions but have refrained
                            from mentioning a conference on Vietnam. We think the explanation is
                            extremely simple: that they are not too happy with the way things have
                            gone in Laos, but that they see Vietnam falling into their laps in the
                            fairly near future. At the same time, as to Laos, none of us think that
                            the Communist side would concede in any meaningful fashion on any of the
                            preconditions; they probably hope that Souvanna or we would abandon
                            these preconditions, and they probably share our judgment that for
                            Souvanna to do so would drastically weaken his own position in Vientiane
                            if not destroy it.</p>
                        <p>3. In key parts of the rest of Asia, notably Thailand, our present
                            posture also appears weak. As such key parts of Asia see us, we looked
                            strong in May and early June, weaker in later June and July, and then
                            appeared to be taking a quite firm line in August with the Gulf of
                            Tonkin. Since then we must have seemed to be gradually weakening—and,
                            again, insisting on perfectionism in the Saigon government before we
                            moved. With all the weakness that we all recognize in the Saigon
                            political situation, the fact is that it is not an unusual or unfamiliar
                            one to an Asian mind, and that our friends in Asia must well be asking
                            whether we would support them if they too had internal troubles in a
                            confrontation situation.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_32" n="32" facs="0064"/>
                        <p>4. The sum total of the above seems to us to point—together with almost
                            certainty stepped-up Viet Cong actions in the current favorable
                            weather—to a prognosis that the situation in Vietnam is now likely to
                            come apart more rapidly than we had anticipated in November. We would
                            still stick to the estimate that the most likely form of coming apart
                            would be a government or key groups starting to negotiate covertly with
                            the Liberation Front or Hanoi, perhaps not asking in the first instance
                            that we get out, but with that necessarily following at a fairly early
                            stage. In one sense, this would be a “Vietnamese solution,” with some
                            hope that it would produce a Communist Vietnam that would assert its own
                            degree of independence from Peiping and that would produce a pause in
                            Communist pressure in Southeast Asia. On the other hand, it would still
                            be virtually certain that Laos would then become untenable and that
                            Cambodia would accommodate in some way. Most seriously, there is grave
                            question whether the Thai in these circumstances would retain any
                            confidence at all in our continued support. In short, the outcome would
                            be regarded in Asia, and particularly among our friends, as just as
                            humiliating a defeat as any other form. As events have developed, the
                            American public would probably not be too sharply critical, but the real
                            question would be whether Thailand and other nations were weakened and
                            taken over thereafter.</p>
                        <p>5. The alternative of stronger action obviously has grave difficulties.
                            It commits the US more deeply, at a time when the picture of South
                            Vietnamese will is extremely weak. To the extent that it included
                            actions against North Vietnam, it would be vigorously attacked by many
                            nations and disapproved initially even by such nations as Japan and
                            India, on present indications. Most basically, its stiffening effect on
                            the Saigon political situation would not be at all sure to bring about a
                            more effective government, nor would limited actions against the
                            southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in fact sharply reduce
                            infiltration or, in present circumstances, be at all likely to induce
                            Hanoi to call it off.</p>
                        <p>6. Nonetheless, on balance we believe that such action would have some
                            faint hope of really improving the Vietnamese situation, and, above all,
                            would put us in a much stronger position to hold the next line of
                            defense, namely Thailand. Accepting the present situation—or any
                            negotiation on the basis of it—would be far weaker from this latter key
                            standpoint. If we moved into stronger actions, we should have in mind
                            that negotiations would be likely to emerge from some quarter in any
                            event, and that under existing circumstances, even with the additional
                            element of pressure, we could not expect to get an outcome that would
                            really secure an independent South Vietnam. Yet even on an outcome that
                            produced a progressive deterioration in South Vietnam and an eventual
                            Communist takeover, we would still have appeared to Asians to have done
                            a lot more about it.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_33" n="33" facs="0065"/>
                        <p>7. In specific terms, the kinds of action we might take in the near
                            future would be:</p>
                        <p>a. An early occasion for reprisal action against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Possibly beginning low-level reconnaissance of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> at once.</p>
                        <p>c. Concurrently with a or b, an early orderly withdrawal of our
                            dependents. We all think this would be a grave mistake in the absence of
                            stronger action, and if taken in isolation would tremendously increase
                            the pace of deterioration in Saigon. If we are to clear our decks in
                            this way—and we are more and more inclined to think we should—it simply
                            must be, for this reason alone, in the context of some stronger
                            action.</p>
                        <p>d. Intensified air operations in Laos may have some use, but they will
                            not meet the problem of Saigon morale and, if continued at a high level,
                            may raise significant possibilities of Communist intervention on a
                            substantial scale in Laos with some plausible justification. We have
                            gone about as far as we can go in Laos by the existing limiting actions,
                            and, apart from cutting Route 7, we would not be accomplishing much
                            militarily by intensifying US air actions there. This form of action
                            thus has little further to gain in the Laos context, and has no real
                            bearing at this point on the South Vietnamese context.</p>
                        <p>e. Introduction of limited US ground forces into the northern area of
                            South Vietnam still has great appeal to many of us, concurrently with
                            the first air attacks into the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. It
                            would have a real stiffening effect in Saigon, and a strong signal
                            effect to Hanoi. On the disadvantage side, such forces would be possible
                            attrition targets for the Viet Cong. For your information, the
                            Australians have clearly indicated (most recently yesterday) that they
                            might be disposed to participate in such an operation. The New
                            Zealanders are more negative and a proposal for Philippine participation
                            would be an interesting test.</p>

                        <p>There are three distinct aspects to the Bombing-of-the-North gambit:</p>
                        <p>a. Retaliation in kind against major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            terrorism or North Vietnamese actions against U.S. personnel or
                            installations. We should do this with or without a stable government in
                            Saigon, but after evacuation of dependents.</p>
                        <p>b. Limited, selective attacks against infiltration-related targets. We
                            should do this only if there is a stable government in Saigon and after
                            evacuation of dependents.</p>
                        <p>c. Large scale bombing of military and industrial targets. We should not
                            initiate this with or without a stable government in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>We should not underestimate the risk of bombing the North. (A summary of
                            a recent <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> study on Communist military
                            readiness capabilities is attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> But aside from the risk of
                            greatly expanded hostilities, there is the considerable risk that the
                            object of the exercise (i.e., forcing Hanoi to call off its dogs in the
                            South and/or to improve our negotiating posture) won't be attainable by
                            this means. The risks involved in retaliation are less than those in the
                            other two categories.</p>
                        <p>I assume that our objective in Vietnam is to reduce the insurgency to a
                            point where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can handle the
                            problem itself or alternatively to establish sufficient leverage to
                            achieve by negotiation what we are unable to achieve (at least achieve
                            in a reasonable period of time) on the ground. If this be so, then the
                            war must still be fought and victories achieved in South Vietnam. A
                            major (and well-publicized) military victory a month would do much to
                            convince Hanoi that the cost of the insurgency is high and would entail
                            infinitely less risk than bombing important North Vietnamese
                            installations. Moreover, a few important military victories are now
                            essential for Vietnamese (and U.S.) morale. But how?</p>
                        <p>Thus far, U.S. military advisers at Division level and above have had
                            virtually no significant influence on the planning and execution of
                            major <pb xml:id="pg_35" n="35" facs="0067"/>military operations. We
                            advise period. In large part this is because we have been understandably
                            reluctant to go beyond this. In large part, too, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officers resist relying on U.S.
                            advice at this level because of (not unnatural) regard for face and
                            pride. Thus we find ourselves critiquing rather than executing a Binh
                            Gia-type operation.</p>
                        <p>Simply, briefly, crudely we have, or think we have, the best staff
                            officers in the world; our intelligence on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations and concentrations, while still not good
                            enough is improving; regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            forces are nothing to be ashamed of. What is needed is to undertake the
                            kind of top-level strategic and tactical planning using <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces that we would be using if it
                            were indeed our war. This will take some new arrangements with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, some additional high powered
                            U.S. staff officers and a willingness to assume the risk of authority
                            and responsibility for failure as well as success.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Re Evacuation</p>
                        <p>Depending on accompanying and subsequent U.S. moves, the evacuation of
                            U.S. dependents can signal determination or weakness. My own feeling is
                            that we should pare down sharply. We have more use for <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s than to ride school buses; the presence
                            of so many women and children in Saigon is an inhibition, conscious or
                            subconscious, on action. To wait until we have to evacuate in haste and
                            possibly in confusion would be folly.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Re the Government</p>
                        <p>All we need—and all we should press for—is a government that is in
                            charge, that is prepared to continue the war, that is receptive to our
                            advice, and that has enough support or at least acceptance among the
                            various political groups to stay in power for a couple of years—or, at
                            least, have its personnel shuffled and structure modified only in
                            reasonably orderly fashion. Whether it's a military, civilian,
                            democratic or autocratic government is beside the point now.</p>
                        <p>Developments in the last day or so indicate that there may be a thaw in
                            the relationships between <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and the Embassy. This is fine
                            and we should move forward carefully and gently rather than worrying
                            about the fine print of any <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>However, we still confront the Buddhists, who will continue to retain the
                            power to move [make] any government unworkable, even if they cannot
                            actually topple it—a fact of contemporary Vietnamese political life we
                            will simply have to accept and reckon with. The problem is that the
                            Buddhists—or, more accurately, the militant bonzes who now control the
                            “Buddhist movement”—don't know what they want, in a positive sense. The
                            Buddhist leadership enjoys the exercise of political power but prefers
                            to veto rather than propose. It does not want the <pb xml:id="pg_36" n="36" facs="0068"/>responsibility of office or, actually, direct
                            participation in the governmental process. This leadership is
                            hypersensitive to affronts to its honor or present political position,
                            and to any recrudescence of what it considers “Neo-Diemist” or
                            “Catholic” authority. The leadership is also divided among itself and
                            jockeying for primacy within the Buddhist movement in a manner such that
                            no contender for politico-ecclesiastical power can afford to let another
                            appear more militant than he. (In many ways the Buddhist movement in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> bears striking analogies to the
                            Civil Rights movement in the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>At the moment the Buddhist leaders, particularly <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>, are calling for Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s ouster. Actually,
                            this demand may be a bargaining counter. When <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> came to power, <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> was ready to accept him, but
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> “out”
                            politicians got the ear of <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam
                                Chau</persName> in mid-November and persuaded <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> to lend his tacit support to
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> demonstrations.
                            To prevent <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam</persName> from usurping the
                            mantle of militancy, <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>
                            moved to the head of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> parade.</p>
                        <p>The Buddhists can probably be placated and Huong simultaneously kept in
                            office but only if there is a juggling of personnel in <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s cabinet and in the make-up of
                            the compromise body which emerges to replace the <gloss target="#t_HNC1">HNC</gloss>. To keep the Buddhists on the reservation it will be
                            necessary for discreet overtures to be made to <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and to other leaders to
                            flatter them by soliciting their views and, more importantly, to sell
                            them on the need for not opposing <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>, if
                            only to maintain the appearance of governmental continuity. In turn,
                            however, their advice will have to be sought on the composition of the
                            successor to the <gloss target="#t_HNC1">HNC</gloss> and on cabinet
                            changes. These soundings would have to be undertaken by both Vietnamese
                            and Americans. The process will be delicate and time is fast running
                            out. If started at once, however, and if reasonable Buddhist personnel
                            demands are met, they can perhaps be kept in line during the critical
                            days ahead.</p>
                        <p>On the US side, such soundings might perhaps best be taken by a special
                            Washington emissary. His presence and functions would obviously have to
                            be carefully coordinated with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, but such an emissary could play a useful role as
                            a lightning rod, a soothing balm to hypersensitive Vietnamese pride, and
                            a communicator between presently contending elements in Saigon.</p>

                        <p>1. First let me thank you for your 2052 and related messages.<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">
                                <ref target="#d9">Documents 9</ref>-<ref target="#d13">13</ref>.</note> It is an exceedingly helpful and thoughtful
                            analysis of the situation, and it gives me the clearest understanding I
                            have had of the situation as you see it and of the reasoning behind your
                            recommendations. We have discussed the matter at length here, and we
                            have a large measure of agreement with your analysis.</p>
                        <p>2. We agree with your implicit assessment that strength and clarity of
                            U.S. commitment and determination are of major importance in political
                            and even military balances in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. We are inclined to adopt a policy of prompt and clear reprisal,
                            together with a readiness to start joint planning and execution on
                            future military operations both within South Vietnam and against the
                            North, but without present commitment as to the timing and scale of
                            Phase II.</p>
                        <p>4. We are convinced that it is better to remove dependents before
                            reprisals begin, and we believe that by adoption and public indication
                            of reprisal policy we can provide the necessary demonstration that this
                            act represents firmness, not weakness.</p>
                        <p>5. In the light of these conclusions, we propose for your consideration
                            and comment the following course of action in the coming weeks. Specific
                            timing would depend on timing and character of political truce now in
                            sight.</p>

                            decision to adopt a policy of prompt and fitting reply to Viet Cong
                            atrocities, whether against Vietnamese or Americans. We would prefer
                            that this indication be given by inconspicuous background briefings
                            rather than formal public statement, but request your judgment whether
                            necessary indication of firmness to cover dependent withdrawal can be
                            achieved in this way.</p>
                        <p>(2) After firmness of reprisal policy is clear, but before reprisals,
                            prompt and orderly evacuation of all U.S. dependents.</p>

                            Subject to your comment, we suggest following guidelines for such
                            planning:</p>
                        <p>(a) Reprisal planning should include provision for action by forces of
                            both U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(b) Targets should be in southern section of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(c) Reprisal plans should be subject to review and approval, before any
                            given execution, by two chief executives.</p>
                        <p>(d) Reprisal planning should be based on premise that reply should be
                            made within 24 hours unless circumstances of atrocity sharply modify
                            normal presumption of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> guilt.</p>
                        <p>(4) At the same time that reprisal planning is initiated, we should press
                            for closer cooperation in planning and execution of major military
                            actions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Binh Gia action raises
                            question whether we should not have arrangements which could prevent
                            classical error of piecemeal commitment described in your weekly report.
                            More affirmatively, we are sure that a few solid military victories
                            achieved by use of U.S. military command judgment and energy would be
                            worth all the rest of this program put together.</p>
                        <p>(5) We would inform top <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> leadership of
                            our readiness to begin joint contingency planning for Phase II actions,
                            but would make it very clear that decisions in this area would
                            depend:</p>
                        <p>(a) on experience in reprisal actions</p>
                        <p>(b) on joint efforts to achieve victories within South Vietnam, and</p>
                        <p>(c) on joint efforts to achieve political stability.</p>
                        <p>My decisions on Phase II will necessarily be affected by performance in
                            earlier activities.</p>

                            departments are bringing the best and most experienced Americans to

                        <p>I would hope that you could develop a new plan for volunteer fighting
                            forces that would proceed with a minimum of overhead and a maximum of
                            energy in direct contact with the Vietnamese at all levels.</p>
                        <p>I constantly hear, re Vietnam, we have too much staff, too much
                            administration, too much clerical work, too much reporting, too much
                            rotation and not enough action. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> are probably the ablest regulation officers

                            choices: To work as best we can with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, or virtually disengage from an in-country
                            military and economic role. </p>
                        <p>Choice between these alternatives would obviously involve most serious
                            issues and might hinge on judgment that could only be made over period
                            of days as to whether new military government or present one effectively
                            dominated by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had some
                            degree of popular support, would get on with war, and was ready to work
                            genuinely with US. If so we might well have to swallow our pride and
                            work with it. Hence our only short-term guidance would be to avoid to
                            extent possible action that commits us one way or the other. This might
                            well involve, for example, taking no early initiative to see <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, letting him come to us, but
                            also doing nothing to change pattern of working relations at all levels
                            until situation clarifies. </p>
                        <p>Realize above does not get us very far, and would appreciate your

                        <p>1. We have drawn much satisfaction from your message (Ref. A). With its
                            indication of general agreement with our thesis that the deteriorating
                            situation here requires prompt action to pull the government together,
                            to stimulate pacification and to raise the public morale. Also, I hope I
                            am correct in assuming agreement that the action required includes a
                            prompt passage into Phase II operations against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as soon as possible and the adoption of
                            a policy of prompt and clear reprisals for what has variously been
                            termed “an unusual hostile act” (Ref. B) of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or any major or spectacular <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> action in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> whether
                            against U.S. personnel and installations or not (Ref. C). However, it is
                            clear from your message that final approval of either of these courses
                            of action, Phase II operations or reprisal bombing, is subject to
                            certain conditions. </p>
                        <p>2. It is these conditions which I should like to discuss because,
                            frankly, some of them seem to work against the broad thesis that it is
                            to our interest to act rapidly along the two lines indicated above. I
                            think that I can best set forth the issues by discussing the following
                            problems which arise from analyzing Ref. A. </p>
                        <p>A. How to establish the firmness of a reprisal policy by public
                            announcement so that the evacuation of our dependents will not appear to
                            be running. </p>
                        <p>(1) The problem here is how we could get our dependents out before taking
                            any retaliatory action without creating panic in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and creating misunderstanding of our motives in the
                            U.S., in North Vietnam and in other interested foreign countries. Within
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, there are the reactions of
                            three groups which we shall have to consider, the government, the
                            Vietnamese armed forces and the Vietnamese general public. The
                            suggestion in Deptel 1419 is that we get across our intentions and
                            motives by “inconspicuous background briefings rather than by formal
                            public announcement”. <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45" facs="0077"/>We are very
                            doubtful here that any public statement without action will carry
                            conviction to any of the audiences mentioned above. We are sure that
                            background briefings are not an adequate vehicle for this kind of
                            communication. While background briefings are a well understood and much
                            [used] technique in the U.S., they are by no means as useful with the
                            Vietnamese officialdom or public. The latter are so accustomed to
                            ignoring, discounting or, according to their mood, being alarmed by
                            rumors and half-truths published in the scores of little sheets which
                            pass for their press, that we cannot expect to communicate an authentic,
                            credible message by this technique to the Vietnamese whom we wish to
                            reach. A formal public statement would be somewhat more effective but it
                            runs counter to our conviction which is also strongly shared by Souvanna
                            Phouma in Vientiane and by various Thai leaders in Bangkok that in
                            dealing with the North we should act first, and, if necessary to talk at
                            all, talk later. </p>
                        <p>(2) There are also certain dangers in making any advance statement on the
                            subject of reprisals even if such a statement had a high order of
                            credibility. We are not sure how the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            would react to such a statement. But they might undertake to present us
                            with a series of fuzzy and ambiguous provocations to which we would not
                            wish to respond but to which we would be pressed to respond by public
                            opinion aroused by our brave statement of intention. In particular, I am
                            sure that we would be under constant pressure from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take actions in cases where we would
                            not feel reprisal warranted. In short, I do not believe that a statement
                            of reprisal policy in advance of initiation is the best way to cover the
                            withdrawal of our dependents. </p>
                        <p>There is no good way to do so which will avoid creating serious
                            difficulties but, if the decision is made to withdraw dependents, I
                            personally would prefer to base our action upon the need to reduce the
                            number of non-essential U.S. personnel to exposure to terrorist actions
                            and on the need to clear the decks for the accelerated military
                            activities which are expected to follow the termination of the recent
                            political crisis. </p>
                        <p>(3) I am sorry if we seem to be belaboring the point of the timing and
                            manner of the withdrawal of our dependents. We will, of course,
                            cheerfully abide by whatever decision is made, but all of us here deeply
                            feel that in the present situation this action, for whatever expressed
                            reason taken, is fraught with serious adverse consequences. Even if
                            prior withdrawal of our dependents had only a marginal effect on the
                            totality of the situation here; our margins are already too thin to
                            warrant paring them further. None of us feel that the program set forth
                            in Embtel 2055 subjects our dependents to undue hazards and in the light
                            of the practical difficulties of making an adequate explanation in
                            advance of a reprisal, we feel that our former recommendation (Embtel
                            2055) remains the preferred course of action. </p>

                        <p>B. How to make a reprisal within 24-hours after the provocation. </p>
                        <p>(1) I doubt very much that this requirement can be met, although certain
                            actions can be taken to reduce the required time between the provocation
                            and the retaliatory strike. We can submit to you and Prime Minister
                            Huong a number of possible targets associated with infiltration and
                            located within the Southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Six
                            such targets have already been identified and plans have been made to
                            expedite their attack. With prior Presidential agreement before the fact
                            to these plans for the strikes, we would then require only the final
                            authorization for execution of one or several of these approved plans. </p>
                        <p>(2) General Westmoreland is of the opinion that he could assure execution
                            within 24 hours of receipt of your authorization to strike but that it
                            would be unwise to count on a shorter time. The Vietnamese aircraft
                            which would participate in such a strike are normally involved in
                            operations in areas often remote from the bases from which the reprisal
                            strikes would be launched. Also, one must always take into account the
                            need for crew rest and thorough briefing. Likewise, varying conditions
                            depending on the time of day at which the order to execute may be
                            received and the uncertain conditions of weather at the time make it
                            unrealistic to be overly precise in fixing a mandatory time of reaction. </p>
                        <p>(3) While we recognize that generally speaking the faster we get off a
                            retaliatory strike the better, it seems to us that there are strong
                            arguments to avoid fixing a time of reaction which might become a
                            self-imposed and unnecessary straight-jacket on our freedom of decision.
                            A lapse of even several days will not prevent establishing a clear
                            linkage between the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> action and our
                            reprisal and under certain circumstances may be desirable to permit us
                            to take action under the most favorable conditions. Let us not hurry
                            ourselves if it is not necessary. </p>
                        <p>C. How to initiate Phase II actions as rapidly as possible and under as
                            favorable conditions as possible. </p>
                        <p>(1) With regard to Phase II operations, you will recall that, based upon
                            the authorizations contained in references B and C. I have already
                            broached the matter of joint planning for Phase II with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> senior authorities in early December.
                            At that time, General Westmoreland and General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> designated chief planners to
                            represent each side and reached agreement on the general purpose of the
                            planning. However, because of the subsequent political events, they
                            agreed to defer further action. Khanh has tried recently to reopen the
                            matter with General Westmoreland and has asked him whether he was now
                            ready to proceed. At my instructions, General Westmoreland indicated
                            that he could not give a final answer until the termination of the
                            political crisis. </p>
                        <p>(2) In Embtel 2052, I asked for authority to go somewhat farther than my
                            December instructions and, upon resumption of joint planning, to tell
                            our Vietnamese counterparts that we definitely intended to initiate <pb xml:id="pg_47" n="47" facs="0079"/>Phase II operations provided the
                            new government reached the criteria which were communicated to them
                            following my return from Washington. As I read Deptel 1419, I am not
                            entirely sure whether the effect (paragraph 3 and paragraph 5) is to
                            extend my authority in the way requested or, on the contrary, to
                            increase the conditions precedent to initiation of Phase II. I would
                            like to assume that I can [garble—indicate our?] intention to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with regard to initiating Phase II but
                            with the understanding that there is no present commitment as to timing
                            and or as to scale. At the same time, I would like to interpret the
                            language of paragraph 5 as adding nothing to the requirements previously
                            transmitted to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in December. </p>
                        <p>(3) In view of the nature of the recent political truce, in applying the
                            criteria for governmental performance, I am sure we will have to use
                            much common sense and great leniency if we are ever going to take
                            action. The weakened civil government which has resulted from the
                            political compromise with the generals is not going to make in the
                            coming months much measurable progress toward real political stability
                            and strength. If we are ever to get into Phase II and, as you know, we
                            consider it essential do so, we may have to be satisfied with little
                            more than the continued existence of a government in whose name we can
                            act and to whose request for assistance we can respond. If, after giving
                            about another month's run to our efforts in Laos, the Huong government
                            is still in business, my feeling is that we should be ready to embark on
                            Phase II operations, if only for the pulmotor effect upon the internal
                            situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. </p>
                        <p>D. How to improve joint efforts to achieve victories within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(1) General Westmoreland would say that he feels that we have gone about
                            as far forward in influencing the planning and execution of operations
                            as the advisory concept will permit. Inherent in that concept is the
                            fact that Vietnamese commanders make the final decisions and assume the
                            ultimate responsibilities. It is estimated that a good advisor can
                            influence his counterpart with respect to a decision about 80 percent of
                            the time. Less effective advisors will, of course, have a lower batting
                            average. A few Vietnamese officers are not disposed to take any
                            advice—these we usually manage to have removed, but it takes time. </p>
                        <p>(2) The proof of the effectiveness of the system is the evidence of its
                            results. A summary of actions and results in 1964 indicates that some
                            7,000 members of the armed forces of Viet-Nam were killed in action as
                            against about 17,000 Viet-Cong. Out of some 2,400 large unit actions
                            (those most influenced by U.S. advisors), about 60 percent made contact
                            with the Viet-Cong. During the last four months (the period of keeping
                            records in this form) 1,539 large and small actions which made contact
                            were observed and rated by U.S. observers. Out of these engagements, <pb xml:id="pg_48" n="48" facs="0080"/>the U.S. observers considered
                            1,377 or approximately 90 percent to have been successful. </p>
                        <p>(3) The Binh Gia battle has made recent headlines as I mentioned in my
                            last week's report to you.<note n="6" xml:id="d22fn6">
                                <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> This unsuccessful
                            action was not the fault of American advisors, but rather the result of
                            their difficulty in getting to the senior commanders who were
                            preoccupied with political matters. Unfortunately, commanders here will
                            not delegate authority to their subordinates so that in their physical
                            absence it is very difficult to get any decision. This was the case at
                            Binh Gia where <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> did not
                            really get into the action until the battle was virtually over. </p>
                        <p>(4) Now that there is a political truce, we will make every effort to get
                            these commanders back to their primary business of fighting the war. I
                            think most of them are pretty sick of political involvements and can be
                            expected to turn in an improved military performance, at least for a
                            while. </p>
                        <p>3. The foregoing represents the principal problems which we see arising
                            from Deptel 1419 and our comments thereon. We are very glad to know that
                            you are asking the concerned Departments and agencies to examine the
                            situation with respect to the assignment and rotation of our personnel
                            in the light of the prospective withdrawal of dependents. </p>
                        <p>Seen from here, we feel that our supporting agencies in Washington have
                            done extremely well by us in terms of the quality of Americans sent
                            here. There will, of course, have to be changes made in the rules of
                            assignment and rotation if dependents are withdrawn. </p>
                        <p>4. As a summary to the discussion presented in the foregoing paragraphs,
                            I would like to recommend for your approval the following policy
                            statements to serve as guidance to all interested agencies of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>A. In case of any major or spectacular Viet-Cong action in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> (Tab E, Ref. C) whether against U.S.
                            personnel and installations or not, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/U.S. forces will execute a reprisal air attack as

                        <p>On January 12 in response to a request from <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JRH1">Robert H.
                                Johnson</persName> of the Policy Planning Council sent to
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> an 11-page paper entitled “The United
                            Nations and the Vietnam Problem.” In his covering memorandum,
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> wrote that the paper had “the benefit
                            of substantial oral contributions and review in two drafts by L, UNP,
                            and <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>,” but that there had not been
                            time for these offices to clear the final text.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the paper considered “at
                            various places the manner in which the question of negotiations might
                            arise in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration and also
                            contains a very brief discussion in the first section on the possible
                            positive values of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a place for
                            launching negotiations should these be desired.” This subject was
                            considered in detail by <persName>Johnson</persName> in a 4-page paper,
                            which he transmitted separately to <persName>Bundy</persName> also on

                            signing and publication January 9 of the joint civilian-military
                            communiqué put an official end to the political crisis which was ushered
                            in by the Armed Forces Council's coup on December 20. Today the
                            government issued a second communiqué to explain that Vietnamese-U.S.
                            relations are, as always, intimate and cordial while tomorrow evening,
                            Chief of State Suu is giving a “tea party” for the wrap-up conciliation
                            of the principal participants, Vietnamese and U.S., in the recent
                            coolness. Hopefully thereafter, we will make a new start forward. </p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Interior announced Sunday<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">January 10. </note> evening that the detained <gloss target="#t_HNC1">HNC</gloss> members had been released and permitted
                            to return home. The Minister of Interior has informed us that March 21
                            is the current target date for the convocation of the National Assembly
                            and that he now envisages a mixed procedure of elections in the cities
                            and appointments in the countryside for choosing the Assembly's
                            membership. Lower Interior officials have indicated privately to us that
                            the Cabinet will consider a proposed election law this week. </p>
                        <p>Despite these indications of conciliation between the armed forces and
                            the government, General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>,

                                    2, Document 21</ref>.</note> just before the signing of the
                            first communiqué, made it quite clear that he still considers the armed
                            forces the only true guardian of the nation's anti-Communist spirit with
                            the responsibility to intervene whenever they consider that there are
                            undesirable elements working their way into the government. He intimated
                            that he was seeking the Buddhists as colleagues in this monitorship of
                            the government. </p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_51" n="51" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>The suggestion of an alliance of some sort between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and the Buddhists, long
                            predicted by <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, finds some
                            verification in the Buddhist encouraged strikes and demonstrations in
                            the Hue-Danang area. Young Turk General Thi who is responsible for law
                            and order in the region is doing little, if anything, to suppress the
                            demonstrators. The Buddhist Institute will certainly raise the level of
                            their anti-Huong activities if the word gets about that the army will
                            not intervene. Fortunately, in the Saigon area, the local commander,
                            General Dong, is a staunch character apparently loyal to <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the basic unbalanced political equation remains with us: the
                            civilian government, weak in prestige and authority, is caught between
                            two forces whose objectives are not identical—the army and the Buddhist
                            Institute—but both of which desire some degree of indirect control over
                            the government without assuming corresponding responsibilities. An added
                            element of instability is that both of these turbulent elements have
                            their own internal lines of division. </p>
                        <p>Viet-Cong military activity declined during the week, following the major
                            battle at Binh Gia the week before. The week was marked by Viet-Cong
                            harassment of thirteen district capitals by mortar fire—mostly in the
                            Delta. Similarly, on the government's side, although the number of
                            ground operations increased, contact with the Viet-Cong was down. </p>
                        <p>The personnel strength of the armed forces has continued to rise slowly
                            but steadily during recent weeks and will not fall much short of the
                            year end goal. Furthermore, a conscription law is under revision and a
                            new draft is expected to be completed this month. The proposed law
                            specifies that deferment is a privilege and not a right, and may be
                            voided. </p>
                        <p>While there have been some indications of public relief over the
                            termination of the internal political tension, press censorship has
                            prevented many of the facts from being generally known. The preparations
                            for Tet, the lunar new year festival, have attracted far more popular
                            interest than the political goings-on.<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">In

                                there is good reason to suspect him of a desire to return to full

                        <p>1. Arrangements for evacuation should be re-examined so that the 7–10 day
                            period referred to by <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> can
                            be telescoped into, say, 2 or 3 days. (There are, altogether, slightly
                            more than 1600 U.S. dependents in South Vietnam, of whom only about 100
                            are outside Saigon. We think that, if necessary, we can move some ships
                            from the Seventh Fleet into Saigon harbor and get everybody out in one
                            fell swoop.) </p>
                        <p>2. We feel that there should be a direct relationship between evacuation
                            and a major reprisal against a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            spectacular. Thus: </p>
                        <p>a. At the moment approval is given to Saigon to undertake reprisal,
                            dependents should be alerted (if this is leaked, we should indicate in
                            background briefings that ordinary prudence requires such preparation). </p>
                        <p>b. Actual evacuation should occur upon the initiation of reprisal action. </p>
                        <p>c. Immediately after the reprisal targets are hit, the President should
                            issue a statement to the effect that we have responded to the latest
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> atrocity, our planes have carried
                            out their mission, are on the way back to their bases, and that U.S.
                            dependents are in the process of being evacuated. The announcement
                            should be put in terms of our readiness to respond to further <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> provocations, and our desire to relieve
                            both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. forces of diversionary
                            efforts to protect dependents' schools, homes, etc. </p>
                        <p>With respect to Phase II: We are recommending that we inform Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that we can provide
                            no guidance beyond that given to him in early December. The decision on
                            the timing and scale of Phase II operations will have to be made at the
                            Presidential level. </p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_53" n="53" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>Note: There are some sticky details on evacuation that have not been
                            dealt with: What to do about working wives, older children, etc? What to
                            do about British and other foreign dependents (for whom I think we have
                            expressed some responsibility—they number about 1000)? Whether we
                            evacuate them all directly back to the U.S.? </p>
                        <p>I have been brooding about another approach to evacuation. Briefly—Send
                            mothers and school children under 12 home and not recruit any one with
                            young children. Send older kids to boarding school in <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss> or elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> (there are some good ones) and permit mothers to stay
                            on at own risk (parents can visit kids, but not vice versa). Raise
                            medical and psychological requirements for all civilians. Comme ca. </p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> still resists the
                            immediate withdrawal of dependents. He says that it would not be
                            practicable to cover it with hints of a reprisal policy in Saigon, and
                            he says that if we tie the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            reprisals in this way, they will feel a right to request reprisals after
                            nearly any small act of provocation. So he goes back to his own
                            recommendation that we wait on dependents until after the reprisal is
                            ordered. Rusk, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I
                            agree that we should go back to him with another proposal, but because
                                <pb xml:id="pg_54" n="54" facs="0086"/>we think this is a poor week
                            to ask you for any major decisions, I suggest we send this one over
                                <persName>Rusk</persName>'s name without committing you at this
                            stage. Our suggestion is that we stick to the notion of immediate
                            withdrawal of dependents, by proposing to him that he sound out the
                            Prime Minister on this matter and authorizing Max to propose to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> that the withdrawal
                            be covered and explained by a Presidential statement here. The object of
                            this statement would be to indicate our firmness and determination
                            without explicitly discussing reprisals. The experts think it might well
                            do the job, but we need to give Max a chance to comment. </p>
                        <p>The statement<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">The statement was sent to Saigon
                                for comment; see <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note> we
                            suggest is as follows: </p>
                        <p>“I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            to arrange for the evacuation of the dependents of all official American
                            civil and military personnel in South Vietnam. In taking this action I
                            recognize the personal hardships that will be imposed on these loyal
                            Government servants who are already working in trying circumstances.
                            Nevertheless, I feel a personal responsibility for the safety of the
                            wives and children involved and consider that in view of the
                            ever-present danger of indiscriminate attacks, and the irresponsibility
                            of the Communist terrorists, they must depart. We continue to seek peace
                            in South Vietnam as in all Southeast Asia, but as long as the Communists
                            persist in their efforts to take over the country there will be danger
                            to Americans as, of course, there also are to the long-suffering
                            Vietnamese people themselves. I also regard it as essential that
                            American officials and military personnel in South Vietnam be relieved
                            of every duty or responsibility unrelated to the effective execution of
                            aid to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and also that that
                            Government not be asked to bear any burdens of support or protection
                            which are not absolutely essential to its own safety. This evacuation
                            therefore will begin at once and will, of course, be carried out in a
                            manner to minimize hardship and difficulty for all those concerned.” </p>
                        <p>Max's incoming also tries to tighten your commitment to Phase 2
                            operations. (Air attacks against North Vietnam that are not specifically
                            reprisals.) We would propose to answer by saying that you would not be
                            ready at this stage to go beyond the position stated in your last
                            message, namely, that you are willing to have joint planning but must
                            make it very clear that any decisions by the President on Phase 2 will
                            “necessarily be affected by performance” in reprisal actions, in
                            military efforts within Vietnam, and in the struggle for political
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>If the truce of the tea party holds and this line of action seems
                            reasonable to you, we would try to keep Vietnam quiet until after
                            Wednesday.</p>

                        <p>1477. For the Ambassador from the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Your 2116<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">
                                <ref target="#d22">Document 22</ref>.</note> provides us with a
                            further helpful analysis of your situation as it relates to the various
                            proposals for action we have had under review between us over recent
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. As a result of our study of your message here and after further
                            discussion with the President I can provide you with the following
                            guidance with respect to the five recommendations (A through E) at the
                            close of your telegram.</p>
                        <p>A. Your arguments concerning the relation between reprisal action, the
                            withdrawal of dependents and public handling of these questions have
                            been thoroughly weighed. We continue to be of the view that it would be
                            far preferable if dependents could be withdrawn in the near future and
                            prior to initiation of possible reprisals. The continued presence of
                            dependents entails serious risks for their safety which we should avoid
                            if at all possible and their presence also can interfere with the
                            carrying out of the military job at hand and imposes a burden on the US
                            and Vietnamese authorities.</p>
                        <p>At the same time we agree that any action on dependents must be taken in
                            such a way as to avoid serious risk of creating panic in South Viet-Nam,
                            creating misunderstanding of our motives in the US and elsewhere in the
                            world, or reducing the effectiveness of the US mission. Therefore,
                            unless you see serious objection we would ask you to explore with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> on a strictly
                            personal and confidential basis the entire question of evacuation of US
                            dependents and report his reaction and your recommendations for further
                            action on this matter in the light of his views. After explaining why,
                            from the US point of view, we consider it wise to take such action soon,
                            you may tell <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> that
                            simultaneous with evacuation the President would make a public statement
                            which would remove any possibility of the evacuation being
                            misinterpreted as a reduction or withdrawal of US support or commitment
                            in any sense. We envisage a statement by the President along the
                            following lines:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the statement, with minor editorial changes, as
                            contained in <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.]</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_56" n="56" facs="0088"/>
                        <p>With respect to reprisals we propose the following steps:</p>
                        <p>(1) Immediately following the occurrence of a spectacular enemy action
                            you would propose to us what reprisal action you considered
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>(2) Following the President's decision and simultaneously with reprisal
                            action he would carefully inform the American people and world of our
                            actions and the underlying reasons.</p>
                        <p>(3) We continue to believe that reprisal must be undertaken as fast as
                            possible following provocation and that this should not exceed 24 hours
                            except when absolutely unavoidable.</p>
                        <p>B. It is not possible now for us to make any commitment on Phase II
                            actions going beyond our guidance of December 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d435">

                            II operations, this will call for the agreement of the President and of

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I was pleased to receive the authority to discuss the matter of the
                            evacuation of dependents with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> and will seek an appointment as soon as I receive
                            a reply to this cable which raises matters which need to be pretty well
                            settled to permit response to questions he is likely to raise.
                            Incidentally, because of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s limited perceptiveness in such matters as assessment
                            of political and psychological reactions, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> and I feel that <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> should be included in our
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. We will
                            do so unless you indicate an objection.</p>
                        <p>2. Our main problem remains how to explain our evacuation of dependents
                            in way which will seem reasonable and straightforward and thus avoid
                            alarming <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and third countries who
                            have nationals here, or who are providing or may provide free world aid.
                            In developing such statement of our case, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have given us some assistance in the explosive charge
                            found January 16 at the special services pool near Tan Son Nhut
                            Airfield. Assuming it remains your view that dependents should be
                            withdrawn, statement such as following appears to us about the best we
                            can do:</p>
                        <p>“A. The finding of the explosive charge at the special services swimming
                            pool on January 16 confirms previous indications that American
                            personnel, including their wives and children, will henceforth be
                            targets for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorist actions. This
                            conclusion has been reached at a time when <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been reviewing its policy regarding dependents in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in light of developments of
                            situation in that country and clear need to concentrate all US efforts
                            on assisting people of Viet-Nam in their efforts to resist Communist
                            subversion. Under such circumstances, it has been question for some time
                            as to whether continued presence of dependents is consistent with desire
                            of US to maintain a posture of maximum readiness to meet whatever
                            contingencies may be forced upon US and Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>“B. The probability of further <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            terrorist activities, added to these other considerations, has led to
                            decision to adopt policy of removing wives and children from South
                            Viet-Nam. Movement of dependents to <pb xml:id="pg_58" n="58" facs="0090"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> will cease at once and movement of
                            dependents from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> will begin at once
                            on phased and orderly schedule. It is not possible at this time to
                            estimate length of time required to complete this movement. Inevitable
                            personal problems of affected households will be given sympathetic
                            consideration in carrying out this policy.”</p>
                        <p>3. Foregoing seems to me best argument we can make. You will note that we
                            avoid suggesting that presence of dependents is cause for personal
                            concern by heads of families or is significant burden on US and
                            Vietnamese authorities. We do not believe these could be accepted as
                            valid points here and their inclusion in US statement would weaken its
                            credibility.</p>
                        <p>4. There are several additional questions related to evacuation upon
                            which I need guidance as they are likely to arise in our discussions
                            with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>.</p>
                        <p>A. When and how do we propose to inform other friendly govts of our
                            decision and what do we think they are likely to do about their
                            dependents? (We presume initial notification would take place in
                            Washington and we would chime in shortly thereafter. We have here no
                            real estimate of governmental reactions as we have avoided any
                            discussion of subject and recognize difficulty of Washington in making
                            any such estimate.)</p>
                        <p>B. What action would we propose to take with regard tourist and other
                            non-essential US travel to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>? What
                            advice will we give to private Americans and their families here? (It
                            seems to us that, to be consistent, we should advise withdrawal of
                            dependents of private Americans and discourage tourist travel which is
                            still considerable to Saigon.)</p>
                        <p>C. What effect do we anticipate on airlines and their willingness to
                            continue to fly into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>? (As you know
                            Pan American (which is only US commercial service here) pilots have long
                            been threatening to refuse to fly into Saigon because of alleged
                            dangers. Only because of strenuous Embassy and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> efforts have they been willing nervously to continue.
                            With announcement on dependents and the probable decline in tourist
                            traffic resulting therefrom, Pan American may drop its commercial
                            passenger service here.)</p>
                        <p>D. What is our estimate of the effect on the ability to obtain additional
                            free world assistance (particularly non-military) and to retain that
                            already committed? (Although we are not able to estimate its extent, it
                            seems to us this kind of assistance is sure to decline.)</p>
                        <p>E. About how long do we estimate it will take to remove our dependents?
                            (On the latter point, I would like to say at least month, perhaps
                            longer. There should be no emergency air about this operation; it should
                            be viewed as an administrative procedure and conducted accordingly. Any
                            pell-mell atmosphere will completely destroy impression of calmness
                            which we wish to convey. If during this period need for <pb xml:id="pg_59" n="59" facs="0091"/>reprisal should arise, we should
                            execute reprisal, then accelerate evacuation if necessary.)</p>
                        <p>5. Remainder of this cable deals with various aspects of
                            retaliation—first, requirement to retaliate within twenty-four hours
                            after event. We are assuming for purposes of this discussion that clock
                            starts at time of verification of facts and nature of event and that
                            occurrence of spectacular actions of kind listed in Tab E Ref B will be
                            accepted as enemy acts without need for formal investigation or proof.
                            These two assumptions are essential to any realistic reprisal policy
                            which includes a twenty-four reaction requirement. It took us about 29
                            hours to learn full extent of casualties in Brink bombing and to get any
                            confirmation of our immediate conviction that it was <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-conducted. If such an event had occurred
                            in provinces, many more hours would have been required for these
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>6. We are making close analysis of feasibility of twenty-four hour
                            reaction under foregoing assumptions. It is probable that following
                            preliminary measures will have had to be taken in advance of incident to
                            offer any likelihood of being able to retaliate in 24 hours:</p>
                        <p>A. Advance Washington approval of attack plans of six to ten possible
                            reprisal targets.</p>
                        <p>B. Discussions with PriMin with regard to possible need for his
                            concurrence in reprisal action on very short notice.</p>
                        <p>C. General discussions with restricted number of Vietnamese military of
                            possible <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> strikes against southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> targets with maximum effort to avoid any suggestion of
                            commitment to ACL. It may be necessary to keep certain number of
                            aircraft on alert at Danang with pilots briefed on number of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> targets in order to meet reaction time
                            requirement. Inevitably, this action would connote strong intention to
                            strike which, if not carried out, would cause us serious difficulties
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D. Procedure for flash transmittal to Saigon of Washington authority to
                            execute reprisal.</p>
                        <p>7. Even if foregoing preparatory measures are in effect, twenty-four hour
                            requirement may be defeated by time of day or year of incident and by
                            weather conditions at time. Weather is likely to be particularly
                            troublesome and could entail delay of several days. Should wicked be
                            allowed to escape by these fortuities? We will have shortly more
                            specific comments on twenty-four hour problem when our current analysis

                        <p>8. Final comment on retaliation relates to need of Presidential statement
                            mentioned in subpara 2 Ref A. We think that there is much to commend in
                            views of Thais and Souvanna that we should act and then not talk about
                            our actions. More public the challenge we present to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> more difficult becomes for them and
                            their friends to back down or <pb xml:id="pg_60" n="60" facs="0092"/>remain inactive. Without any statement, news will get around fast
                            enough (witness overly rapid dissemination of word on Ban Ken)<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">The attack by U.S. aircraft on January 13
                                (designated Barrell Roll Nine) on a bridge near Ban Ken, North
                                Vietnam, over which the North Vietnamese Government was supplying

                            of bucking up our friends. I recognize there is US domestic problem but
                            I would hope it could be met without involving President. If,
                            nevertheless, some US statement is considered essential, I would think
                            it important to preserve thesis that this is Vietnamese war in which we
                            play supporting role and thus that first statement should be made by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Such action would be consistent
                            with operational concept which we prefer of having first bombs dropped
                            by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> aircraft. In short, we feel
                            that we should keep Vietnamese in front as we move into reprisals
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and/or Phase II
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>9. In summary, we request (a) general approval of the substance of the
                            proposed statement on evacuation, (b) guidance to answer questions of
                            para 4 above, (c) approval of assumptions of para 5 above, and (d) any
                            comments on our discussion of various aspects of the reprisal problem.

                            good will with the civilian and military leadership integrated amicably
                            into the <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> government. On
                            that day, a formal treaty of understanding was signed between <pb xml:id="pg_61" n="61" facs="0093"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> covering the participation of
                            military officers in the Cabinet. In our view the officers agreed upon
                            were generally quite good.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MLM1">“Little” Minh</persName> as Armed
                            Forces Minister seemed an excellent choice. General Thieu, as second
                            Deputy Vice Prime Minister, is able and relatively experienced but, as a
                            Catholic with Dai Viet political connections, is a sure target for
                            Buddhist criticism. General Vien, the Minister of Information, is
                            intelligent and cooperative but without experience in the information
                            field. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, the erratic
                            Chief of the Air Force, had apparently accepted the post of Minister of
                            Youth, Sports and Civil Defense but was known to be insisting upon
                            retaining his military assignment concurrently. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> had taken a position in
                            opposition to any “double hatting” but was willing to leave the final
                            decision on the matter to the military themselves. Events seemed to be
                            moving smoothly just up to the time for the presentation of the new
                            Cabinet to Chief of State Suu at Gia Long Palace on Tuesday
                                afternoon.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">January 19.</note> Shortly
                            before the hour fixed for the ceremony, General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, speaking for the Armed Forces
                            Council, called everything off and threw the entire matter into
                            renegotiation.</p>
                        <p>We now know that the issue raised at this last minute was a complaint
                            championed by General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> that,
                            while the military were contributing some of their best officers to the
                            Cabinet, on the civilian side there had been no purging of undesirable
                            ministers. I have just learned that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> has acceded to this complaint
                            and will replace the present Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Lam</persName>, and Minister of Health Dieu
                            shortly after the Tet holiday, that is to say, about February 5. The
                            principal count against <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Lam</persName>
                            appears to be a past association with General <persName corresp="#p_MBM1">“Big” Minh</persName>, a fact which suggests that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as well as
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> had a hand in tossing this
                            last minute monkey wrench. The presentation of the Cabinet to the Chief
                            of State has been rescheduled for 5:00 o'clock today, January 20, but we
                            will keep our fingers crossed until the tea and cakes have been
                            served.</p>
                        <p>While we have felt that the introduction of some military officers into
                            the Cabinet is desirable in order to oblige them to share the
                            responsibility, the foregoing events show how fragile is any agreement
                            reached with General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            his generals. As a group, they are basing their actions and decisions
                            upon a “consensus of views” which thinly disguises a caucus procedure.
                            Working in such an atmosphere, the generals have been unable to develop
                            any basic unity of purpose and have displayed lack of responsibility in
                            their actions and little reliability in fulfilling their undertakings.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is in the middle of
                            this turmoil pulling the strings and seeking to maneuver to his personal
                            advantage. Thus far, he <pb xml:id="pg_62" n="62" facs="0094"/>has got
                            away with it by virtue of his agility of wit and foot, but one senses
                            that this cannot last indefinitely. Needless to say, it is a sad way to
                            conduct military business.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, January 19 was a bad day not only because of the disappointment
                            at Gia Long Palace but because of the renewed indications of new
                            Buddhist difficulties. Several of the Buddhist Institute leaders told us

                            grievances which ring true only in the ears of the leaders of the
                            institute. They have no identifiable program other than getting

                            officials of their own choosing. They refuse to recognize that the
                            overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> is almost
                            certain to bring about an all-military government, the last thing which

                        <p>The week was quite favorable to the government in a military sense. Viet
                            Cong incidents were down in number and in intensity from those of the
                            previous week. The Viet Cong lost 422 killed in action as against 146
                            for the government. However, pacification progress remained sluggish as
                            during past weeks.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the conference with Congressional leaders by
                            explaining why it had been called. He said that at the very beginning of
                            the Congressional session he wanted to develop procedures which would
                            make it possible for the Administration to think and plan with
                            Congressional leaders. He was ready to be frank and candid in all
                            matters but to do so the discussions must not get into the public
                            domain. Real damage is done to the national interest when information
                            such as that which will be given during the course of the morning
                            meeting, gets into the newspapers. The objective is to make possible an
                            examination of our foreign policy and our defense structure by the
                            Congressional leaders of both parties who are stewards of these
                            policies. We do not separate Democrats and Republicans in Vietnam. He
                            wanted to work with the legislative leaders in understanding, if not
                            agreement, on both sides of the House and Senate. During the Eisenhower
                            Administration the system of consulting Congressional leaders was the
                            best he had ever known. The meetings were not many, perhaps 4 or 5, but
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, who had
                            been blunt and frank with Congressional leaders, had asked for their
                            judgments on important problems.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and the
                            Foreign Relations Committee had not been invited to this morning's
                            meeting because he wished to limit this conference to very few persons.
                            At a later date it will be possible to enlarge the number. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had already briefed the
                            Congressional committees on foreign policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would be going to the Hill
                            later to spell out our defense posture, part of which had already been
                            made public in the Defense message sent to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was available for personal meetings with individual
                            legislative leaders at any time.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64" facs="0096"/>
                        <p>Turning to substantive matters, the President said that since the last
                            meeting with Congressional leaders in October<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">The President met with Congressional leaders on October 19, 1964,

                            Administration had studied the situation in Vietnam intensively. He
                            spoke of his conference with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in December.<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d432">

                            present. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would go into
                            the details later but the basic fact is that we need to have in Saigon a
                            stable government as a base for further actions.</p>

                        <p>Returning to the problem of Vietnam, the President said that he would ask
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to spell out
                            the details of the increased military activity we are carrying on in
                            Southeast Asia but first he wished to discuss the question of U.S.
                            dependents in South Vietnam. He expressed concern that the Viet Cong
                            might attack U.S. citizens in Saigon in the event we carry out air
                            strikes in North Vietnam. The North Vietnamese might react by dropping
                            bombs on Saigon. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            and other U.S. military and civilian officials in South Vietnam are
                            opposed to bringing home our dependents, however, he had thought we
                            should do so for over 14 months.</p>
                        <p>The President said that because he does not have a “Lincoln Cabinet,”
                            (i.e., one which votes for an action unanimously, only to have the
                            President decide against the action) the decision as to whether to
                            withdraw dependents is still being explored. The President said he was
                            concerned that the communists might take some irrational action which
                            would result in the loss of many American women and children. If that
                            happened, the American people would hold him responsible for not having
                            ordered the dependents returned home earlier.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believed our relations with other nations should be
                            dealt with on a non-political basis. President Kennedy was fortunate to
                            have had in the Congress Republicans who supported his foreign policy.
                            President Truman had Senator Vandenberg. The Administration has no
                            mortgage on patriotism. The Republicans have ideas we want to know
                            about. Republicans should be in on foreign policy take-offs rather than
                            merely at the time of crash landings. The President said that the
                            responsibility for foreign policy decisions was his but he wanted the
                            views of all. These views would be studied and given full <pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0097"/>consideration. All of us want to
                            do the right thing in respect to foreign policy and our defense posture.
                            Never in recent history has there been greater willingness to consider
                            these two subjects from the point of view of the national interest
                            rather than party politics.</p>
                        <p>The President praised <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, adding that he was
                            keeping the Director from leaving government. He praised Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, noting that the latter had
                            lost over $4 million as a result of his having left industry to run the
                            Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The President said his objective is to try to unite the United States so
                            that in the eyes of the world it is a united country. In his relations
                            with other nations, his objective is to seek to avoid a nuclear
                            holocaust while ensuring the defense of the nation. He appealed to those
                            present to give him their attention, the benefit of their wisdom and
                            their judgment.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to go into greater detail on major foreign policy
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said our greatest
                            problem in South Vietnam is political instability. Our over-riding
                            objective is to achieve political unity there. The President interrupted
                            to point out that the leaders of allied and friendly states are hesitant
                            to send aid to South Vietnam because of the political instability there.
                            They fear that they might appear foolish if, after they send aid, the
                            country goes to pieces politically.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued by saying
                            that Hanoi believes that if it can hold on a little longer it can win
                            South Vietnam for communism because political instability is increasing.
                            The Secretary spelled out the details of the current compromise between
                            the South Vietnamese civilians and the military leaders which has
                            resulted in the formation of a new cabinet. The Secretary made clear
                            that we are keeping the political lines open so that, if there is any
                            interest on the other side, a settlement based on either the 1954 or the
                            1962 agreement can be negotiated. If the communists will not negotiate
                            with us on a return to the earlier agreements, we are in for a very
                            difficult time in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Laos, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            said that that country provided a thermometer registering what is
                            politically possible in Southeast Asia. Current discussions among the
                            three factions in Laos may possibly lead to a 14-nation conference. If
                            we could settle the difficulties in Laos on the basis of the 1962
                            agreements, the effect in South Vietnam would be beneficial to us.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Indonesia, West New Guinea, the Congo,
                            Burundi, the Sudan, the Middle East, Germany, and the Alliance for
                            Progress.]</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to discuss the military side of the Vietnamese
                            problem.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_66" n="66" facs="0098"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> began by
                            stating that our estimates of Viet Cong strength in South Vietnam were
                            up. In addition, we have evidence that the number of guerrillas being
                            infiltrated from North Vietnam to South Vietnam has increased
                            substantially. From 1959 to date, we estimate that between 19,000 and
                            34,000 North Vietnamese have crossed into South Vietnam to take part in
                            guerrilla activity below the 17th parallel. The current annual rate of
                            those infiltrating to South Vietnam may be in the neighborhood of
                            10,000.</p>
                        <p>At the same time that the Viet Cong strength is increasing, the military
                            strength of South Vietnam is also rising. This is because the number of
                            South Vietnamese recruits has increased even though the number of
                            desertions remains high. Hopefully the South Vietnamese forces will be
                            increased by 87,000 men in 1965.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by Senator Saltonstall, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that those who desert
                            from the South Vietnamese army do not join the Viet Cong but simply go
                            back home.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen, addressing the President, said that a reliable
                            correspondent, Mr. Keyes Beech, Correspondent of the Chicago Daily News,
                            had made certain statements about Vietnam. The President interrupted to
                            challenge Senator Dirksen's description of Mr. Beech as a reliable
                            correspondent. The President said Mr. Beech had reported last December
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was
                            returning to Washington threatening to resign unless the President
                            ordered attacks on North Vietnam. The President said General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had flatly denied any such
                            intention and had telephoned the White House from Honolulu to explain
                            that Beech's report was entirely without foundation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> resumed his
                            presentation by saying that in 1964, 17,000 Viet Cong and 7,500 South
                            Vietnamese were killed in the fighting. A total of 245 U.S. personnel
                            had been killed in South Vietnam since 1954.</p>
                        <p>Senator Saltonstall asked why there was such a disparity between Viet
                            Cong forces and the much larger South Vietnamese forces. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that on the
                            basis of extensive experience we had concluded that a numerical
                            advantage of 10 to 1 is required to win a guerrilla war. We need
                            currently more South Vietnamese troops but not more U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>The President said we have decided that more U.S. forces are not needed
                            in South Vietnam short of a decision to go to full-scale war. The ratio
                            is now approximately 5 South Vietnamese to 1 Viet Cong. The war must be
                            fought by the South Vietnamese. We cannot control everything that they
                            do and we have to count on their fighting their war.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> asked why we do not
                            push into North Vietnam in an attempt to overcome the existing disparity
                            between the South Vietnamese and the Viet Cong forces.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_67" n="67" facs="0099"/>
                        <p>The President intervened to say that he had called the leaders together
                            today not to discuss all the details of our programs but to inform them
                            in general and to work out procedures under which such meetings could
                            take place every few weeks. He again cautioned against leaking to the
                            press information about today's discussion. He said if reporters learned
                            of the information being made available to the leaders all would be
                            lost.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> replied that perhaps
                            he should not be told all of the details. He did not want to hear things
                            that he should not know about but he did want some response to his
                            question as to why we did not move against North Vietnam in some
                            way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded by
                            summarizing our covert operations in North Vietnam. During the past year
                            we have been carrying out our program by building up the South
                            Vietnamese forces necessary. Some of these forces, having completed
                            their training, are now being used. All are non-U.S. personnel, but all
                            have been trained by our forces. Infiltration teams are being dropped in
                            North Vietnam and attacks from the sea are being launched against the
                            coast of North Vietnam. Semi-covert operations consist of reconnaissance
                            missions in Laos carried out at Souvanna's request. We have facilitated
                            the carrying out of more than 450 reconnaissance missions over Laos in
                            order to obtain needed information. We have discovered there has been a
                            substantial movement of Pathet Lao forces into the Panhandle of Laos. We
                            have so far lost 4 U.S. aircraft in these operations. The recent bombing
                            of the bridge at Ban Ken in Laos, which we have not officially
                            confirmed, was part of the U.S. armed reconnaissance program. This
                            bombing was carried out by U.S. planes because the bridge was heavily
                            defended by anti-aircraft guns. The Laos Air Force was not able to carry
                            out this particular mission with their T-28 planes.</p>
                        <p>Senator Saltonstall asked whether the objective was to affect the
                            situation in Laos or that in Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we wanted to affect both
                            situations. The armed reconnaissance affected the power situation in
                            Laos but also affected the infiltration of Viet Cong to South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then turned to
                            the problem of withdrawing U.S. dependents from South Vietnam. The U.S.
                            political and military officers in Saigon do not want to send the
                            dependents home. They are concerned about the effect which a withdrawal
                            would have in Southeast Asia as well as the effect on personnel in South
                            Vietnam. The number of U.S. dependents of government personnel totals
                            1700 plus the dependents of non-U.S. personnel and some other
                            non-governmental U.S. personnel.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_68" n="68" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen said he could not understand why we did not bring the
                            dependents home. We are pampering our forces in South Vietnam. Why do we
                            have to send all our civilization to war.</p>
                        <p>The President said that for 14 months he had agreed with those who want
                            to bring our dependents home, but the officers in Saigon are still
                            opposed.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> said he wanted to
                            reassure the President that he shares the Vandenberg philosophy. His
                            relations with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> are excellent. This
                            meeting had been extremely helpful and he hoped there would be more such
                            meetings. He believes the opposition party will cooperate with the
                            Administration and will not take positions which are harmful to the
                            national interest. Personally, he agrees with the course of action being
                            followed in South Vietnam. We had to keep our commitment to the South
                            Vietnamese. Referring to the 25,000 to 30,000 persons who had been
                            infiltrated into South Vietnam since 1959, he asked how it would be
                            possible to get a better ratio than 5 to 1 if this infiltration keeps
                            increasing. Should military action be taken to cut down the
                            infiltration? He concluded by repeating his view that the meeting had
                            been wholesome and hoped that frequent and regular meetings of this kind
                            would be held.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion primarily on Germany, the U.S. defense posture,
                            the Middle East, and China.]</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">Smathers</persName> asked why the
                            U.S. Navy was not being used to halt infiltration by sea from North to
                            South Vietnam. Without associating himself with the information, he
                            summarized the views of some Navy officers to the effect that there are
                            many ways we have not used which could bring about an end of
                            infiltration by sea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied by saying that sea infiltration had
                            almost been completely stopped because of a program we had initiated and
                            were carrying out which makes possible the patrol of all sea area by
                            South Vietnamese forces. All junks moving south are now stopped and
                            searched by South Vietnamese ships. However, some of the land border is
                            under water and although we have made extensive efforts to deal with
                            this problem no solution so far has turned out to be feasible. The
                            seacoasts have been taken care of but much infiltration is still taking
                            place across the water borders.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the Department of Defense research and

                        <p>The President read parts of a draft press statement which he said he
                            wished to issue at the conclusion of the meeting. He asked whether there

                                <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) Since it remains our view that dependents should be withdrawn we have
                            studied carefully points raised your reftel and are providing following
                            answers and comments to enable you discuss this matter with PriMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. It is recognized
                            that withdrawal of dependents will precipitate speculation and could
                            alarm both South Vietnamese Government and people and third country
                            nationals. We believe, however, that as long as Presidential statement
                            explains evacuation on basis need to concentrate all US efforts on
                            assisting Viet Nam to resist Communist subversion, evacuation would be
                            understood in constructive context. It will remain true of course that
                            it will be our actions more than our words which will help maintain
                            morale but if evacuation of dependents is seen as an action in support
                            of efforts to assist Viet Nam, it may even have salutary effect.
                            Questions you have posed concerning other Governments and non-official
                            Americans are troublesome but we believe not insuperable.</p>
                        <p>(2) In discussion with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> (in
                            which you may include Vien) please use only substance of proposed
                            statement (see below); also make clear we are seeking his reaction and
                            that decision to evacuate not yet taken here.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_70" n="70" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>(3) Text of proposed statement set out your reftel appears acceptable in
                            substance, subject to comments which follow, but we believe that it must
                            be made initially in Washington rather than in Saigon as your text
                            appears to suggest. As for text itself, last two sentences Para 2 B
                            appear unnecessary. With regard to first of those two sentences we are
                            also concerned lest initial release might invite communists to press
                            terrorist actions. We also feel that final sentence Para 2A suggests too
                            passive an approach on our part; for this reason would prefer final
                            phrase to read “desire of U.S. to maintain a posture of maximum
                            readiness to take whatever action may be required in support of those
                            efforts.”</p>
                        <p>(4) With respect to points raised Para 4 your message the following
                            guidance is provided:</p>
                        <p>(a) We agree that notification other friendly governments should take
                            place here first and it would be in essentially same terms we have
                            proposed to discuss question with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. Although evacuation our dependents will bring in
                            its train closing down of facilities and termination arrangements which
                            may raise difficulties for dependents of other governments, each is
                            obviously free to make its own decision on this matter. We recall that
                            when we evacuated our dependents from Laos in 1960, dependents of most
                            other friendly governments remained and never were withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>(b) With regard to dependents of private Americans and tourist travel we
                            would envisage issuance general notices objectively describing situation
                            and leaving it for individuals to make their own decisions, taking
                            responsibility on themselves for risks if they visit as tourists or if,
                            as private Americans, they keep their dependents on hand. We would of
                            course still have residual responsibility to help them with emergency
                            evacuation if there were real and immediate threat to their safety.</p>
                        <p>(c) We agree that there is distinct possibility Pan Am may drop its
                            commercial passenger service to Saigon although we would expect that
                            both here and through U.S. Mission Saigon efforts will be made to keep
                            them coming. For most part dangers which make necessary withdrawal
                            dependents do not seriously interfere with airline operations.</p>
                        <p>(d) We can also foresee possible added difficulties to securing
                            additional free world personnel, particularly non-military, for service
                            outside Saigon. We have some reason to hope that there will be cases
                            where this will not be problem.</p>
                        <p>(e) Taking as much as one month to execute evacuation appears acceptable,
                            even though a longer period than we would have thought would be
                            necessary, provided the very announcement of evacuation does not
                            increase risks to dependent population and there is no evidence of
                            stepping up terrorist activities. If need for reprisal should arise we
                            would wish to see simultaneous with reprisal a very much stepped up
                            evacuation of remaining dependents.</p>

                        <p>(5) With foregoing in hand assume you will now open discussions with
                            Huong and Vien.</p>

                        <p>1. As we proceed with plans for further discussion of Phase II with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, it will be important that we

                            tactics to be pursued in reading them. Broadly, the first question is

                            generally taken the public position that the latter was our
                            objective—”if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would observe
                            those agreements so would we”—”the basic problem in both Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is violating those agreements,” etc. Also in this
                            connection the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> letter of December 9,
                            1961 to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> stated the increased US
                            military aid which it had requested because of the “flagrant violations
                            of the 1954 Agreement” by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> “can
                            be terminated as soon as the authorities of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> will have ended their acts of aggression and will have
                            begun to respect the Geneva Accords.”</p>
                        <p>2. Our objectives as now framed are to “get Hanoi and North Vietnam
                            support and direction removed from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
                            and, to the extent possible, obtain <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            cooperation in ending <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>” and “re-establish an
                            independent and secure <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with
                            appropriate international safeguards, including the freedom to accept US
                            and other external assistance as required.”</p>
                        <p>3. The question is whether these objectives can be embraced within the
                            concept of a “return of the 1954 Geneva Accords” or if a new
                            international <pb xml:id="pg_72" n="72" facs="0104"/>agreement will be
                            required and, if so, its terms and with whom and how such an agreement
                            would have to be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>4. This, in turn, involves the short-term question of the conditions (and
                            their negotiation) under which we would be willing to suspend Phase II
                            and other such actions against the North and the longer-term question of
                            negotiating a new international agreement or whether it would be
                            feasible to combine the two.</p>
                        <p>5. Of course, to the degree that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            finds the conditions difficult to accept, increased pressure on our part
                            will be required with consequent increased possibility of other
                            Communist bloc involvement in hostilities. Also related is the degree of
                            support or opposition that we can expect from other free world
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>6. As of possible helpfulness to the Department there follows some of our
                            own preliminary thoughts on this subject together with some analysis of
                            the pros and cons.</p>
                        <p>7. First, we suggest that while in our own minds it is necessary to
                            recognize that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> probably does not
                            have full control over all <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, at least to the extent of being able
                            to bring about the surrender of all <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>,
                            we should frame our demands on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            in terms of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> “bringing about a
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> armed insurgency”,
                            leaving to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to plead its lack of
                            control. Such a formulation gives us most flexibility in determining at
                            the time what we feel is an acceptable degree of compliance by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. In the absence of a substantial
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> it also gives us maximum flexibility in
                            determining the extent of our continued assistance to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, or the carrying out of any offers we
                            may make to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, as until the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency has ceased we could point to
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> failure to meet our conditions.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will, of course, also perceive
                            this and we could expect some tough negotiations on this point. Our
                            conditions should, of course, also embrace Viet Minh withdrawal from
                            Laos and freedom for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to operate
                            throughout Laos and, in particular, in the corridor area.</p>
                        <p>8. The next question is what we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might offer in return for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> compliance with whatever conditions we establish.
                            Implicit in our statements that we would observe the Geneva Agreements
                            if they were observed by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is a
                            willingness to return at least to that level of military advisory
                            strength in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which it was recognized
                            we were entitled as replacements of the French, i.e., about 600. This,
                            we could, of course, well afford to do if the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> armed insurgency and its support and direction from the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had, in fact, ceased.
                            Progressive reduction of US advisory effort would, of course, have to be
                            related to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> fold-up and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> progress in long-term pacification
                            program against remaining <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            infrastructure and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> war zone complexes,
                            since <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> likely [to] issue instruction
                            for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to go underground. It might also
                            be possible to obtain <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agreement to
                            offer to enter into trade talks looking toward the normalization <pb xml:id="pg_73" n="73" facs="0105"/>of economic relations between the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Subject to faithful compliance by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, we and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could also give assurances that we would not use or
                            support the use of force against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. An essential part of any offer would also be an
                            undertaking by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (perhaps with
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> observation) to permit <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> desiring to do so to return to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and to grant amnesty to those
                            peacefully laying down their arms desiring to remain in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. If the foregoing commends itself as a general framework for an
                            arrangement the question arises as to whether it can be embraced within
                            the concept of a “return to the 1954 Accords” or whether it inherently
                            requires a new international agreement.</p>
                        <p>10. The 1954 Accords with respect to Vietnam embrace two principal
                            elements: First the “agreement on cessation of hostilities” signed “for
                            the CINC of the Vietnam Peoples Army” and “for the CINC French Union
                            forces in Indo-China” and secondly the “final declaration” of the
                            conference in which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not join, but made separate
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>11. Without attempting to go into details there is much in the first
                            document of a transitory nature and much (such as the provisions on
                            introduction of war material) that have been overtaken by events on both
                            sides. However, both documents embrace the principle that they were not
                            to be “used for resumption of hostilities or to further an aggressive
                            policy”. The second document, i.e., the final declaration, contains the
                            principle of respect by all the parties for “the sovereignty, the
                            independence, the unity and the territorial integrity” of “Cambodia,
                            Laos and Vietnam,” and “to refrain from interference in their internal
                            affairs.” Only the first document embodies the definition of the
                            “provisional military demarcation line”, i.e., the 17th parallel, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. Thus from a legal point of view the 1954 Geneva Accords leave much to
                            be desired as a definitive international framework for an independent
                            and secure <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with appropriate
                            international safeguards. However, all the basic elements are present in
                            one form or another and thus it is our conclusion that a new
                            international agreement with respect to Vietnam is not essential.</p>
                        <p>13. If this is the case, the question arises as to what needs to be
                            negotiated prior to terminating Phase II actions against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and how we should seek its
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>14. It is suggested that in general terms our demands on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could be encompassed in the following:
                            strictly observe the spirit of the 1954 Geneva Accords with respect to
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, that is, “refrain from
                            interference in the internal affairs of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>”, specifically, stop infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and bring about a cessation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> armed insurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, thereafter ceasing all support for and
                            communication with any dissident elements in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. With respect to Laos strictly observe the 1962 Accords
                                <pb xml:id="pg_74" n="74" facs="0106"/>with respect to Laos,
                            including the withdrawal of all Viet Minh forces and personnel from Laos
                            and recognize that the freedom of movement granted the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Laos under those accords is not
                            subject to veto or interference by any of the parties in Laos.</p>
                        <p>15. In turn the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could offer safe
                            passage to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (including their families)
                            desiring to proceed to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and an
                            amnesty to those peacefully laying down their arms. Subject to faithful
                            compliance by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> with the
                            conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could also give assurances that they
                            would not use force or support the use of force by any other party
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and that it would return
                            over a period of time to the 1954 ceilings with respect to the presence
                            of foreign military personnel in South Vietnam. Additionally, as noted
                            above, consideration might be given to an offer by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, subject to the same conditions, to
                            enter into trade talks with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            looking toward some type of normalization of economic relations between
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>16. There are two aspects with respect to any negotiation within the
                            foregoing framework. First, their timely and accurate communication to
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (as well as to others)
                            emphasizing the limited nature of the demands and, secondly, if and when
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> indicates any interest in
                            accepting them, the actual negotiation of any agreement or
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>17. It will be noted that all of the conditions and offers with respect
                            to Vietnam are framed in terms solely of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with the thought that, in spite of the problems it will
                            present, when it comes to an actual negotiation it will be preferable
                            that the principle be that of a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> arrangement, thus
                            seeking to avoid the problems of a formal <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> negotiation. With
                            respect to the conditions pertaining to Laos it would not be entirely
                            inappropriate for the GVN to put forward, in agreement with the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, proposals such as suggested herein
                            inasmuch as the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was a participant in
                            the 1962 conference and the conditions relate directly to the use by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> of Laotian territory for
                            infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Nevertheless, it
                            will probably be necessary to seek to orchestrate simultaneous <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> negotiation.</p>
                        <p>18. The concept with respect to Vietnam would be that if and when direct
                            negotiations were undertaken between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> they could
                            take place at the military level in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> under the auspices of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Throughout, it will be very important to avoid the
                            twin dangers of, on the one hand, becoming involved in a cease-fire
                            vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> accompanied by
                            strung-out negotiations, or, on the other hand, making conditions so
                            stringent as to be unreasonable from an international point of view. We
                            should also avoid any acceptance of the National Liberation Front as a
                            party to the negotiations.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_75" n="75" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>19. It is well recognized that the foregoing concept presents many
                            possible difficulties. Above all its success would depend on a degree of
                            political and negotiating sophistication and capabilities which no one
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and especially the military,
                            have thus far demonstrated. It also assumes an intimacy of relations and
                            cooperation between ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that we have thus far been unable to achieve. It is
                            suggested that this might in part be overcome without entirely
                            sacrificing the principle if the US were also directly to participate in
                            the negotiation at the military level on the basis of the direct
                            participation of US forces in the actions against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>20. It is also realized that the situation could so develop as to make
                            such negotiating tactic entirely impractical. However, it is suggested
                            that whatever the negotiating tactic the essence of our demands and
                            offer would remain the same.</p>
                        <p>21. In any event, whatever the substance of our position and the
                            negotiating tactics, we should at an early stage of our discussions with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on Stage II, undertake also to
                            discuss and arrive at agreement on our terms. At best, this will be a
                            long job of education.</p>
                        <p>22. We would appreciate the comments and views of Vientiane and Bangkok,
                            as well as those of the Department.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, I discussed reprisal
                            procedures in accordance with the authorization contained in reftel. <pb xml:id="pg_76" n="76" facs="0108"/>Unfortunately, because of a
                            breakdown of communications in the Prime Minister's office, Deputy Prime
                            Minister Vien had not been invited to attend.</p>
                        <p>I opened the discussion by citing the document which we had transmitted
                            to the Prime Minister at our meeting on December 7<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">For a report on the meeting, see <ref target="frus1964-68v01">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. I, pp.
                                    982–984</ref>.</note> which included the following
                            paragraph:</p>
                        <p>“During the course of such intensified operations (i.e., against
                            infiltration routes in Laos and at sea) the armed forces of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the US must be prepared and ready
                            to execute prompt defense against or reprisals for any unusual hostile
                            act by the other side. The US mission is prepared to work out with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> appropriate plans and procedures
                            to this end.”</p>
                        <p>I indicated that, because of the political events which followed shortly
                            thereafter, we had not implemented this paragraph by the development of
                            agreed procedures for the execution of reprisals for “unusual hostile
                            acts”. It now seems timely to develop such procedures.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned the strong feeling on our side of the need for rapid reaction
                            if and when a decision were taken to execute a reprisal, indicating that
                            a 24-hour reaction capability should be taken as the norm. To reach such
                            a reaction capability, several preliminary actions should be taken.
                            First, we could select possible reprisal targets in south <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and work out detailed strike plans for
                            them. In making such plans, we should be guided by certain principles,
                            such as the desirability of joint <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> participation
                            regardless of whether the victims of an “unusual hostile act” were
                            Vietnamese, US nationals or both. Another basic consideration would be
                            that US participation would be at the request of the Vietnamese
                            Government and that the first bombs would preferably be dropped by
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> pilots.</p>
                        <p>Once these strike plans were jointly developed, they should then be
                            approved by the appropriate officials of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for possible
                            use in case a decision were taken by both governments to execute a
                            reprisal. To implement such a decision, it would be important for agreed
                            procedures to exist as to the channel of transmittal of such approval. I
                            would undertake to expedite communications on the US side.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it would be useful to consider as a preparatory measure the need
                            for explanatory statements to be issued by both governments in the time
                            of execution of a reprisal strike.</p>
                        <p>Having laid out the problem in the foregoing terms, I asked <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> for his reaction. If he were in
                            general agreement, would he authorize the opening of discussions with
                            his military leaders? In this connection, we were uncertain as to where
                            the military contact should be made. Was it <pb xml:id="pg_77" n="77" facs="0109"/>with new second Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Gen Thieu</persName>, Defense Minister Gen Minh
                            or with C-in-C Gen <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>?</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister showed quiet satisfaction that we were now willing to
                            undertake such discussions. He said that he had been very much surprised
                            that no retaliation had taken place following the Bien Hoa and Brink
                            incidents. He said that he was inclined to discuss the matter at once
                            with <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>, <persName>Minh</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. We discussed at some
                            length the best way of broaching this matter with the military and ended
                            by deciding that <persName>Johnson</persName> and I should call on
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> today and go over the
                            same ground with him as we had with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>

                            arrangement and gets around the possible consequences of inaccurate
                            reporting by <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> of our

                            with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> reported in Ref B,
                            we passed to the subject of dependent evacuation. I explained to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> that there <pb xml:id="pg_78" n="78" facs="0110"/>had long been doubt in Washington
                            as to the soundness of our dependent policy in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Many of our senior officials felt that, in a war-time
                            situation such as we have here, it was psychologically wrong to have
                            dependents whose presence suggested a desire for life as usual. I had
                            had numerous discussions of this matter with Washington over the months
                            during which time we had weighed carefully the pros and cons of a
                            no-dependent policy.</p>
                        <p>Recently a new factor had been introduced—clear indication of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> intention to make American personnel the
                            target of terrorist actions. I cited the Brink Hotel incident on
                            Christmas Eve and six additional incidents in the month of January, the
                            most serious being the explosive charge placed in our Special Services
                            swimming pool compound. It made no sense to expose our dependents
                            unnecessarily under these circumstances. Inevitably in the course of a
                            mounting terrorist campaign, heads of families would be diverted from
                            the main effort of fighting the war by concern over the safety of their
                            families. Thus there are now two strong arguments for changing the
                            dependent policy, the long-standing one of the need of a posture of
                            maximum readiness and now the new one of relieving dependents from
                            exposure to danger and heads of family from concern for their
                            safety.</p>
                        <p>I explained that a decision had not been reached although the weight of
                            arguments for evacuation of dependents was inclining the scales sharply
                            in that direction. If an affirmative decision were taken, it would be
                            followed by a Presidential statement explaining the reason for our
                            action, the initiation of a deliberate evacuation which might run a
                            month or more. But before taking a final decision, we were most anxious
                            to receive <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s advice and
                            frank reactions as we were aware of possible internal complications.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> took the news quietly but
                            in clear recognition of its importance. He said that he would like to
                            reflect on the matter before giving a reply. He said he could understand
                            our position but was concerned that the Vietnamese population might
                            regard it as a step toward US withdrawal. I responded that we too were
                            aware of this danger and the consequent need of a reassuring statement
                            to the public at proper time. We would stand in need of his assistance
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I asked that he keep this matter entirely to himself unless he wished
                            discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">Later that day, after <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> had apparently discussed the matter with

                                Presidential statement announcing the evacuation of dependents also
                                include announcement of military reinforcements in order to
                                attenuate the impact of the evacuation. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We agree that it is important that any evacuation, if and when it
                            takes place, should give correct impression of clearing decks rather
                            than withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>2. There is strong desire here to avoid increasing number of US personnel
                            in South Vietnam above present authorized strengths.</p>
                        <p>3. According to our records, you have requests in the pipeline for more
                            than 6000 additional military personnel. This figure includes 2400
                            engineers, 2100 logistic personnel, 502 for airfield security, 446
                            advisors to complement the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force
                            level increase approved 23 January, 422 Marines with the Hawk Battalion
                            (minus), 419 <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s for Saigon, 96 for 39th
                            Signal Battalion, 35 for the 10th <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>,
                            and 18 for <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss>. Your Embtel 2252 refers
                            specifically only to the Hawk Battalion and <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>4. Balancing all considerations, we are prepared to authorize some
                            additional US military personnel, on the theory suggested in your Embtel
                            2252, if you believe it necessary in order to achieve evacuation of the
                            1800 or so US dependents without serious negative psychological impact.
                            We believe that announcement of deployment of the Hawk Battalion (minus)
                            involving 422 men would serve the purpose. Such deployment is hereby
                            authorized and, subject to affirmative decision being made to proceed
                            with evacuation, you are authorized to time the announcement pursuant to
                            your proposal in Embtel 2252.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_80" n="80" facs="0112"/>
                        <p>5. We wonder whether deployment of 419 additional <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s in Saigon will give us the best combination of military
                            utility and psychological impact. However if you believe that
                            announcement of something more, such as the <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s or the 446 additional advisors is required to give the
                            clearing of decks flavor to the evacuation of dependents, let us
                            know.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> probably looks back on 1964 with
                            some measure of satisfaction. Its most important single enterprise,
                            armed insurgency in South Vietnam, developed favorably. Viet Cong
                            expanded area and scope of operations and enjoyed number of military
                            successes despite increasing US assistance to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Towards end of year they were able to challenge <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces boldly if briefly in several
                            relatively major engagements, and scored several spectacular and
                            well-publicized successes. With exception of Tonkin Gulf incidents,<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d255">

                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Several strokes of good fortune helped <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Viet Cong. Political instability in South,
                            manifested in series of govt upheavals and in recurrent unrest,
                            furthered their cause, not only in its adverse effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military operations and pacification
                            but also by encouraging or rationalizing Vietnamese feelings of
                            lassitude and doubt about chances of putting down insurgency. It also
                            combined with Viet Cong military successes, with which it vied for
                            attention in US and world press, in furthering general pessimism in
                            Western world about war in Vietnam, and it was a principal factor in US
                            public debate about Vietnam policy <pb xml:id="pg_81" n="81" facs="0113"/>towards end of year. Having seen and realized possible benefits of
                            this instability, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and National
                            Liberation Front attempted to support and even foment it, and their
                            propaganda exploited it to maximum advantage.</p>
                        <p>Good luck also helped <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> when Khrushchev
                            was removed from power in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. His
                            fall offered <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> some hope for reduction
                            in acerbity of Sino-Soviet polemics and also offered good opportunity to
                            improve relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> without
                            giving excessive offense to Chinese. Hanoi moved rapidly and skillfully
                            to exploit opportunity and at this writing appears to have been at least
                            in part successful. New Soviet leadership's apparent determination to
                            reassert Soviet influence in Southeast Asia is also auspicious
                            development from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> viewpoint. It is
                            not yet clear from here whether Soviets are planning to pursue this
                            course over long run or whether they are merely following it as part of
                            their post-Khrushchev policy review pending final selection and
                            assignment of worldwide priorities and commitments, but Hanoi very
                            probably welcomes development. Hanoi would hope that Soviet influence
                            will offer powerful additional deterrent to any contemplated US action,
                            as well as some counterbalance to Chinese dominance of the area.</p>
                        <p>Situation in Laos developed in manner less to Hanoi's liking. Though
                            Pathet Lao with heavy <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military
                            support won Plain of Jars, this was counter balanced at least in part by
                            Operation Triangle. Cooperation between neutralists and right wing
                            developed favorably, if in fits and starts, and neutralist Premier
                            Souvanna Phouma appears to be taking increasingly tough anti-Communist
                            line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> domestic political scene remained
                            relatively stable during 1964, with no change apparent in top-level
                            leadership or in major policies. Possibly significant development was
                            decline in public manifestations of internal struggle resulting from
                            Sino-Soviet split. Editorials denouncing modern revisionists and listing
                            their shortcomings fell off during spring and dropped further after
                            Khrushchev ouster. Political personalities who had been principal
                            spokesmen of emerging pro-Chinese line during 1963 (e.g., Nguyen Chi
                            Thanh, Le Duan) receded into background, to be replaced gradually on
                            center of stage by traditional national personalities such as
                                <persName>Pham Van Dong</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VNG1">Vo
                                Nguyen Giap</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>Despite its successes during 1964, year was not all favorable to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and Hanoi still faces host of problems
                            in coming year. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            establishment performed better than might reasonably have been expected
                            in view of political unrest, and was able to deal Viet Cong number of
                            damaging blows. Moreover, increasing number of countries committed
                            themselves behind <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> struggle. In 1965
                            Viet Cong victory by military means is still not in sight, unless
                            political fabric in South tears completely or unless <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Army is split and rendered ineffectual
                            by <pb xml:id="pg_82" n="82" facs="0114"/>internecine political
                            struggle. Outlook is still for protracted struggle of indeterminate
                            duration, with war becoming more expensive for North (increased pace of
                            infiltration and accelerated supply of new and larger weapons). While
                            there has so far been nothing to suggest that this has placed any
                            significant strain on North Vietnam's economy, it might ultimately do
                            so. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has also been forced into
                            greater public involvement with Viet Cong by dispatch of Northern-born
                            draftees to Viet Cong forces.</p>
                        <p>We estimate that Hanoi is more concerned about what might be termed
                            “international political escalation” of conflict. Basic <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> goal, which appears increasingly
                            difficult to realize, is to win wars in Laos and South Vietnam and to
                            repay full and exclusive benefits of victory without bringing on
                            excessive international attention or involvement. Large scale US
                            presence and commitment represents clear and serious potential danger,
                            of which Tonkin Gulf incidents served as powerful and painful testimony.
                            Soviets and particularly Chinese, while offering welcome expressions of
                            support, may well demand increasing voice as their own commitment and/or
                            assistance grows. Indeed, if major powers become heavily committed,
                            danger arises that they may ultimately reach accord among themselves
                            which will not sufficiently take <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            interests into account. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName>'s international political position is stronger than
                            it had been in 1954, when he was forced to accept less than ideal
                            settlement. He is therefore relatively well insulated against danger
                            that this might happen again, but possibility cannot be excluded if
                            major powers continue to increase pressure. Entire operation will become
                            increasingly difficult and delicate for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and will require extremely adroit and sophisticated
                            political maneuvering.</p>

                            as successfully as during last months of 1964 will depend largely on
                            events beyond its control. If Soviets and Chinese can arrive at
                            arrangement which will permit worldwide Communist attendance at March 1
                            gathering and at subsequent conference, or if other means are found to
                            reduce polemics, Hanoi's situation will be eased considerably. If,
                            however, gap widens further and altercations become increasingly bitter,
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> may find it impossible to pursue
                            relatively neutral course. In latter case, despite grave Vietnamese
                            reservations about Chinese, it appears likely that Hanoi will choose to
                            or be compelled to support <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will nonetheless still do everything
                            possible to maintain at least some ties to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as counterweight to Chinese predominance.</p>
                        <p>No major changes in policy appear to be imminent or even contemplated on
                            domestic scene during coming year. New 5-year plan is not due to start
                            until end of 1965. As in past, big question mark remains possibility
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, now 75, may
                            pass away. No possible successor <pb xml:id="pg_83" n="83" facs="0115"/>now in view has his personal prestige and authority, or could steer
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> through upcoming difficulties
                            with same finesse as Ho.</p>
                        <p>We believe that problems outlined above will be of considerable concern
                            to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leadership during coming year,
                            but there is as yet no evidence that existence of these problems has led
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to relax its militancy or to
                            restrain its aggressive instincts. Instead, as new year begins, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> gives every indication that it intends
                            to maintain and even accelerate pace of insurgency throughout Southeast
                            Asia, to accept negotiations only on its own terms, and to persist in
                            its risky but possibly very profitable policy.</p>

                        <p>I attach a summary of the Vietnamese situation which I think is better
                            than the spate of confusing cables from all and sundry that we have had
                            in the last two or three days. At the end of this memorandum (by my
                            staff man Cooper) two choices are offered. One is to let the political
                            mess play itself out in its own way, and the other is to try to keep it
                            pinned together in roughly its present form at least until March. The
                            latter is <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>'s choice, and it
                            is clearly <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max Taylor</persName>'s as well.
                            It has the advantage that in March under cover of a new National
                            Assembly meeting there could be a reconstruction of the government
                            without <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly true that if <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> goes now, the Buddhists will be more irresponsible
                            than ever. On the other hand, it is equally clear that <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> himself does not have the
                            authority to govern without very heavy and visible U.S. support.</p>
                        <p>The one additional thought I have is that we might make one more effort
                            to talk sense to the Buddhists through some American that they trust.
                            Their particular hero is Cabot Lodge, but the dangers of sending him are
                            obvious. The only way it could be done is on the basis of a direct
                            invitation from <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max Taylor</persName>, and
                            I have asked my brother Bill to consider <pb xml:id="pg_84" n="84" facs="0116"/>whether the idea is sufficiently promising for us to
                            ask Max if he would like to do it. I feel sure myself that in this
                            context Lodge would be a team player and I would be glad to know your
                            own feelings about this.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I continue to believe that a general discussion of Vietnam with

                        <p>In General:—Political maneuvering continues between the civilians and the
                            military, between the Buddhists and the government and between various
                            elements within the military. Indeed the situation in Saigon, Hue and
                            one or two other cities is so fluid and (literally) flammable that we
                            may, at least for the moment, have lost our ability to exert any
                            significant degree of control or influence. Meanwhile, no unusual <pb xml:id="pg_85" n="85" facs="0117"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military activity has been reported,

                            insisted that both <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> had offered their
                            resignations over the weekend (you remember that <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> denied this). <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> claims he has made a deal with
                            the Buddhists which involves inter alia the two chief troublemakers
                            leaving the country. <persName>Johnson</persName> feels <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is encouraging the Buddhists by
                            such dealings and may be thinking about taking over and assuming a
                            Sihanouk-like role and posture.<note n="7" xml:id="d37fn7">The word

                            (especially the on-again, off-again pressure on <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>) indicates that the Generals
                            are deeply divided.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, security forces have surrounded the Buddhist Institute in
                            Saigon and banned all unauthorized entry. In Hue, local authorities have
                            declared martial law, and have reportedly marked some areas where there
                            are U.S. installations as off-limits to marchers. Press reports stated
                            that one crowd of marchers had approached the U.S. Consulate, but all
                            U.S. dependents have been relocated within the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> compound. Most of the demonstrators have been orderly,
                            but the theme of exhortations to them is anti-government and
                            anti-Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. The
                            homes of the Vietnamese information director and of the local national
                            police director were burned by students. A general strike in both Da
                            Nang and Quang Tri, a sit-down strike in Nha Trang, and demonstrations
                            in Hoi An, capital of Quang Nam Province are also underway.</p>
                        <p>More than 200 arrests have been made, including a number of monks. The
                            government claims that some monks arrested have not been bona fide.
                            Meanwhile, the Buddhists over the weekend called for further sacrifices,
                            similar to that of the first monk last year to commit self-immolation.
                            There are press reports indicating that some of the five monks on a
                            hunger-strike may be in poor condition, but they are unidentified.
                            However, government officials had a rumor that <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> hoped to make <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName>, already frail, a martyr by
                            allowing his death. A bonze-ess has burned herself to death in Nha

                            any legitimate grievances. It was felt that this might undercut any
                            developing Buddhist support. <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, however, continues to indicate a preference for
                            firm measures, isolating the Buddhist leaders by trying to separate
                            sects from the United Buddhist Organization, and publicly attacking the
                            Buddhists as tools of the Communists. No reply has as yet been received

                        <p>We have two broad options:</p>

                        <p>B. Take a more active role in a last effort to get a fix that will last

                            All evidence available supports your theory of opportunistic de facto
                            alliance between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            Buddhist Institute leaders to bring down <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> government and replace it with regime which will
                            be both weaker and more inclined towards negotiation with
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. Point on which we not clear is degree of opposition to such move
                            within armed forces and effectiveness with which it could mobilize
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Three questions occur to us:</p>
                        <p>a) Is there in fact a possible combination of military officers capable
                            of removing <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            neutralizing the current Buddhist effort by strong action?</p>
                        <p>b) Is there a possibility of backstopping such an effort by aligning some
                            Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, Dai Viet and non-Institute Buddhist elements behind
                            Huong?</p>
                        <p>c) Can Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTK1">Tran Thien Khiem</persName>
                            play a useful role in developing the sort of military combination
                            described in (a) above?</p>
                        <p>4. If the answers to at least (a) and (b) are yes, we would be inclined
                            let it be known discreetly but immediately to the appropriate military
                            officers individually that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and the Institute are skating on thin ice in their
                            undercutting of the lawful government and we should not be sorry to see

                        <p>The attached intelligence memorandum represents a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> assessment that a coup by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is quite likely tonight. The State Department
                            agrees that the chances are substantial, but rates them a little
                            lower.</p>
                        <p>

                                <persName>Rusk</persName> and I all agree that we can't second guess
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> from here. He
                            is the man on the spot, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max
                                Taylor</persName> being in Bangkok on a long-delayed visit.</p>
                        <p>I discussed with a number of people whether we should try to move Max
                            back in a hurry. The consensus is against it. He has less personal
                            influence with these people than <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis</persName> and is perhaps slightly less skillful in palaver.
                            But what is more important—if there is a coup, we do not want an
                            emotionally explosive reaction from the Ambassador in the first
                            twenty-four hours. We will want time to turn around, and it may even
                            turn out that a change of government could provide the framework for a
                            repair of our relations with these people.</p>
                        <p>Finally, no matter what happens in this particular rumor, there is strong
                            feeling which I share that this back-and-forth in the government in
                            Saigon is a symptom, not a root cause of our problem.</p>
                        <p>It is this basic issue of our own purpose and policy that I hope we can
                            discuss in our 11:30 meeting with you tomorrow, and I will have a paper
                            on that in the morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">See <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note>

                            government on 27 January Saigon time (tonight <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>). On 25 January, <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> stated that, in two more days, a “new element”
                            would be involved in the Buddhist-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> dispute. On the same day General KY stated that he
                            was charged with interviewing civilian candidates for a new government,
                            with a three-day deadline. The US Embassy will not necessarily get
                            advance notice, despite <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s
                            promise.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> saw Deputy Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> again on 26 January,
                            and repeated the views he had expressed over the weekend, viz.: the
                            problem with the Buddhists was grave; the Buddhists cannot retreat and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s handling of them is
                            inflexible; and a blow-up in the near future is inevitable. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> still insists that <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> and Chief of State Suu have
                            “offered” to turn over power to the military, and says he desires a US
                            “go-ahead.” There are signs that the military may try to move behind a
                            figleaf of legality by convening a reconstituted High National Council,
                            which would call for <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s
                            resignation.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> maintains that he fears
                            prolongation of the present situation will lead to <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s downfall and a proneutralist
                            successor. He says he has a written agreement from the Buddhists to a
                            military takeover, a moratorium on Buddhist politics, and the departure
                            from the country of some Buddhist militants. Although there is evidence
                            that the Buddhist leadership is trying to induce a military coup and may
                            be willing to use <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, the
                            Embassy has observed to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            that Buddhist leaders cannot be relied on to honor any such agreement or
                            to refrain from similarly obstructing or attacking any successor
                            government. This appears to be a valid assessment.</p>
                        <p>4. Premier <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> maintains that
                            he never offered to resign, he will not leave office unless forced out.
                            He argues that the Buddhist leaders lack a solid following and can be
                            isolated, provided the military support a strong course, at least until
                            elections can be held. However, although the Buddhist anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> campaign has until now lacked
                            widespread public backing, the campaign is gathering steam. The Buddhist
                            hierarchy has considerable influence among student groups, and the
                            self-immolation by a Buddhist girl on 26 January in Nha Trang may
                            further rouse passions in their favor. This is particularly true in I
                            Corps, where the government's emissary General Thieu has described the
                            situation as grave and where General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> and his deputies show little inclination to curb
                            Buddhist-student demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>5. Although <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s views of the
                            present danger appear to be widely shared by the military, reporting
                            indicates considerable disagreement among the generals over courses of
                            action. There are reports of military opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, both by elements favoring
                            cooperation with the Buddhists and those urging curbs on the Buddhists.
                            Some early move against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            cannot be ruled out.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. At about 10:00 a.m. on January 27 (Saigon time), the Vietnamese Armed
                            Forces Council issued a communiqué stating that in view of the inability
                            of Chief of State <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> to cope with the
                            current political crisis, the Council withdrew its confidence in the
                            government and entrusted General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> with the task of solving the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would immediately establish a
                            20-man council representing the armed forces, major religious groups,
                            and regional interests and responsible for “advising the government in
                            making important decisions.” An announcement by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> shortly thereafter reiterated
                            the actions and stated intentions of the Armed Forces Council. This was
                            followed by a statement by General <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>, Commander of the Capital Military District, that
                            (a) the proposed military-civilian council was the equivalent of the
                            High National Council dissolved last December, (b) the new council would
                            choose a Chief of State who in turn would appoint a Prime Minister, and
                            (c) the Buddhist hierarchy had agreed not to interfere in politics and
                            to send its leading three monks, including <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> and <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName>Tri Quang</persName>, out of the country.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had indicated to the US
                            Embassy and to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> the previous day
                            that he planned a “solution” along these lines. US protestations <pb xml:id="pg_92" n="92" facs="0124"/>apparently did not dissuade him,
                            but he agreed to inform Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> prior to proceeding any further. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in effect presented
                            the US with a fait accompli by informing General Westmoreland (through
                            an intermediary) and requesting merely to talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> at the Vietnamese General Staff
                            headquarters virtually at the very moment Khanh was proceeding to
                            execute his plan. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> then
                            proceeded to outline his “solution” in greater detail to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, noting that (a) his
                            proposed military-civilian council would probably reappoint Suu as Chief
                            of State, (b) the Chief of State's selection of a new Prime Minister
                            would have to be approved by this council, (c) there would be minimum
                            changes in the government and military officers currently in the cabinet
                            would remain, (d) Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> would serve as acting Prime Minister in the
                            interim, and (e) the Armed Forces Council would be the supreme
                            governmental body until these measures had been completed whereupon it
                            would then revert to its function as the “executive body within the
                            military.” <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> also stated
                            that the Buddhist leaders had agreed to refrain from politics and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> would leave the country.</p>
                        <p>3. In subsequent talks with <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> confirmed that both <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> were not disposed to oppose <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s moves and that <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> had agreed to remain in a caretaker
                            status at least until a new Chief of State was selected. Beyond this,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> wished to wait and see
                            “what kind of a government” would emerge before accepting reelection as
                            Chief of State. Both <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>, as well as Deputy
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> who confirmed that
                            he agreed to serve as acting Premier, advised the US also to “wait and
                            see” what develops, expressing concern nonetheless with the apparent
                            alliance between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and the
                            Buddhists and with the political orientation of future developments.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s assumption of power
                            was achieved without any fighting or public disorder. The coup was
                            completely bloodless and, with the exception of some security forces
                            apparently in the vicinity of <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>'s
                            residences, no troops were deployed in Saigon. Neither has there been as
                            yet any criticism or opposition by general public in or outside Saigon.
                            In short, the general public attitude is one of indifference.</p>
                        <p>5. It is not entirely clear just how much support <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has mustered within the
                            military leadership for his move. Previous reports had indicated a
                            three-way split among the generals, the largest group reportedly not in
                            favor of a military takeover. Some generals and even middle-echelon
                            officers were apparently considering a pre-emptive coup against
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. It remains an open
                            question whether the anti-<persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            elements will now move against him or adopt a wait-and-see position,
                            pending further moves by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>,
                            together with public and US reaction.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has almost certainly
                            acted in conjunction with the Buddhist leadership. Buddhist religious
                            and political leaders, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>,

                            Commander) and <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> (Airforce
                            Chief), reportedly agreed on a “solution” similar to the one now in
                            progress. However, this coalition is at best a marriage of convenience
                            which cannot be expected to last given basic Buddhist suspicions of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, not to mention the
                            personal ambitions of Both <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>. Despite <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s apparent belief that he can control the
                            Buddhists, he has voiced some concern as to their ultimate political
                            direction, and there are already indications that the Buddhist
                            leadership does not intend to hold to the alleged agreement particularly
                            regarding the claimed willingness of <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam
                                Chau</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>
                            to leave the country.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s overriding ambition,
                            coupled with his repeated maneuvers against known US positions, have in
                            the span of one year precipitated five major crises in Saigon. In the
                            process, he has seriously reduced if not almost eliminated any public
                            respect for US political advice or for those who accept it. Moreover,
                            his actions, coupled with those of the Buddhists, have fostered a rising
                            crescendo of anti-American feelings.</p>
                        <p>These developments pose the serious question whether <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has considered an alternative
                            course, i.e., a negotiated “neutralist” solution for South Vietnam.
                            Should his short-sighted actions prompt him to explore this possibility,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> may ultimately
                            overreach his power and be overthrown by his more dedicated
                            colleagues.</p>

                        <p>2322. For the President. I am afraid that we have overwhelmed Washington
                            in the last 24 hours in reporting the action of the Armed Forces Council
                            in withdrawing confidence in the Suu-Huong government and in charging
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> with
                            responsibility “for solving the present political crisis.”</p>
                        <p>While it is still too soon to evaluate with confidence the gains and
                            losses of this latest “coup de force”, my colleagues of the U.S. Mission
                                <pb xml:id="pg_94" n="94" facs="0126"/>Council agree with me in
                            believing that several conclusions are valid even at this time. For one
                            thing, it is evident that the overthrow of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> has been brought about through
                            an alliance between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            the Buddhist Institute leadership. It is not clear to what extent the
                            other senior generals supported Khanh with any real conviction in this
                            action although he seems to have got a large majority vote at the
                            conclusion of a long policy debate last night. Another conclusion is
                            that the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> is
                            clearly a victory for the Buddhist Institute leadership and places it in
                            a position of dominant power and influence in the country. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> no doubt hopes to share this
                            position with the Buddhists and use them to his advantage. Based upon
                            our past experience, we are inclined to believe that it will be the
                            Buddhists who will use <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The most sinister aspect of this affair is the obvious danger that the
                            Buddhist victory may be an important step toward the formation of a
                            government which will eventually lead the country into negotiations with
                            Hanoi and the National Liberation Front. The Institute-<persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> combination is a union—albeit
                            perhaps a temporary one—of two elements adverse to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>While reasonably sure of the validity of the foregoing conclusions, we
                            cannot be sure where we are until the announced procedure for forming
                            the government is carried out. Historically, this procedure sets back
                            the clock to last August when the military under Buddhist pressure,
                            turned the power over to the civilians. The same institutions and
                            procedures are being reconstituted to start moving once more down the
                            road toward elections in late March for a national assembly. It remains
                            to be seen whether we ever reach that destination or whether we are on a
                            treadmill.</p>
                        <p>Until we see more clearly the form of the new government to emerge, I am
                            of the opinion that we not commit ourselves publicly with regard to the
                            action of the Armed Forces Council. I have recommended elsewhere<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">In telegram 2316 from Saigon, January 27.
                                (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 US-VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> that we should restrict
                            ourselves for the time being to a simple statement that it is premature
                            for us to comment on these events until we see more clearly their
                            implication.</p>
                        <p>I know that the question of the evacuation of our dependents is
                            constantly on your mind as it is on mine. We have been very much
                            concerned during the last three days for the safety of our
                            dependents—indeed of all Americans—in Hue area. While that danger
                            appears to have subsided, these events in the North have been a reminder
                            of the ease with which anti-American emotions can be whipped up. At the
                            meeting of the U.S. Mission Council today, I found for the first time
                            all members in agreement as to the need to evacuate dependents although
                                <pb xml:id="pg_95" n="95" facs="0127"/>none of us yet has a really
                            satisfactory formula to overcome the very dangerous psychological
                            problems in initiating this action. I believe that this latest change of
                            government offers us a possibility to link evacuation of dependents with
                            our acceptance of a new regime. I will forward recommendations on this
                            score as soon as the governmental situation clarifies.</p>

                            have a very private discussion of the basic situation in Vietnam. In a
                            way it is unfortunate that we are meeting the morning after a minor
                            coup, because that is not the present point. All of us agree with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> that nothing
                            should be done on that until we have particular recommendations from
                            Saigon (though at that point we may well want to urge <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> to make the best of the matter and not
                            try to undo it).</p>
                        <p>2. What we want to say to you is that both of us are now pretty well
                            convinced that our current policy can lead only to disastrous defeat.
                            What we are doing now, essentially, is to wait and hope for a stable
                            government. Our December directives make it very plain that wider action
                            against the Communists will not take place unless we can get such a
                            government. In the last six weeks that effort has been unsuccessful, and
                            Bob and I are persuaded that there is no real hope of success in this
                            area unless and until our own policy and priorities change.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_96" n="96" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>3. The underlying difficulties in Saigon arise from the spreading
                            conviction there that the future is without hope for anti-Communists.
                            More and more the good men are covering their flanks and avoiding
                            executive responsibility for firm anti-Communist policy. Our best
                            friends have been somewhat discouraged by our own inactivity in the face
                            of major attacks on our own installations. The Vietnamese know just as
                            well as we do that the Viet Cong are gaining in the countryside.
                            Meanwhile, they see the enormous power of the United States withheld,
                            and they get little sense of firm and active U.S. policy. They feel that
                            we are unwilling to take serious risks. In one sense, all of this is
                            outrageous, in the light of all that we have done and all that we are
                            ready to do if they will only pull up their socks. But it is a fact—or
                            at least so <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I now
                            think.</p>
                        <p>4. The uncertainty and lack of direction which pervade the Vietnamese
                            authorities are also increasingly visible among our own people, even the
                            most loyal and determined. Overtones of this sentiment appear in our
                            cables from Saigon, and one can feel them also among our most loyal
                            staff officers here in Washington. The basic directive says that we will
                            not go further until there is a stable government, and no one has much
                            hope that there is going to be a stable government while we sit still.
                            The result is that we are pinned into a policy of first aid to
                            squabbling politicos and passive reaction to events we do not try to
                            control. Or so it seems.</p>
                        <p>5. Bob and I believe that the worst course of action is to continue in
                            this essentially passive role which can only lead to eventual defeat and
                            an invitation to get out in humiliating circumstances.</p>
                        <p>6. We see two alternatives. The first is to use our military power in the
                            Far East and to force a change of Communist policy. The second is to
                            deploy all our resources along a track of negotiation, aimed at
                            salvaging what little can be preserved with no major addition to our
                            present military risks. Bob and I tend to favor the first course, but we
                            believe that both should be carefully studied and that alternative
                            programs should be argued out before you.</p>
                        <p>7. Both of us understand the very grave questions presented by any
                            decision of this sort. We both recognize that the ultimate
                            responsibility is not ours. Both of us have fully supported your
                            willingness, in earlier months, to move out of the middle course. We
                            both agree that every effort should still be made to improve our
                            operations on the ground and to prop up the authorities in South Vietnam
                            as best we can. But we are both convinced that none of this is enough,
                            and that the time has come for harder choices.</p>
                        <p>8. You should know that Dean Rusk does not agree with us. He does not
                            quarrel with our assertion that things are going very badly and that the
                            situation is unraveling. He does not assert that this deterioration <pb xml:id="pg_97" n="97" facs="0129"/>can be stopped. What he does say
                            is that the consequences of both escalation and withdrawal are so bad
                            that we simply must find a way of making our present policy work. This
                            would be good if it was possible. Bob and I do not think it is.</p>
                        <p>9. A topic of this magnitude can only be opened for initial discussion
                            this morning, but <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I

                        <p>1549. For Ambassador from President.</p>
                        <p>1. Thank you for your very prompt and clearheaded account<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">Apparently a reference to Document 41.</note> of the
                            events of the last 24 hours. We are inclined to share your judgment of
                            the immediate meaning of these events, and I have complete confidence in
                            your judgment on the spot as you deal with this new situation.</p>
                        <p>2. I am delighted to know that the mission is now unanimous in favor of
                            the evacuation of dependents, and by separate messages<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">See <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>. This was
                                apparently the only other instruction sent to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> at this time through
                                Department of State channels.</note> we are asking for your fastest
                            recommendations on the ways and means of putting this decision into
                            effect with minimum damage to morale, and a maximum signal of our own
                            continuing determination. In this connection I want you to know that
                            once we get the dependents out of there, I am determined to make it
                            clear to all the world that the U.S. will spare no effort and no
                            sacrifice in doing its full part to turn back the Communists in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_99" n="99" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>3. As we look beyond the removal of dependents to specific courses of
                            action in the coming months, I am most eager to have the closest
                            possible sense of your own thinking and of the situation on the spot.
                            For this purpose I am inclined now to take you up on your earlier
                            suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                            come to Saigon, and if you concur, he would plan to leave on Sunday,
                            arriving Tuesday morning, February 2. He would plan to stay for three
                            days, mainly for conversations with you and your colleagues, but also
                            for the purpose of conveying personal word of my own determination and
                            of my own thinking to Vietnamese leaders of your selection.</p>
                        <p>4. It appears from your reports that, for better or worse, we may be
                            increasingly dependent upon unreliable and unpredictable Buddhist
                            leaders. It occurs to me that there is one man who has some unexpended
                            personal capital with the Buddhists, and that man is Cabot Lodge. Unless
                            you would find it objectionable, I am thinking of asking him to come in
                            Bundy's plane for a visit which might later be extended to other points
                            like Hong Kong and Manila. I would think it desirable for him to talk
                            frankly and at length with Buddhist leaders as well as others with whom
                            he has personal connections, always under your direction.</p>
                        <p>5. My own preference would be for a visit from you to Washington, but I
                            feel that such a trip at this time would lead to further troublesome
                            speculation and would also involve your absence during an important
                            period of readjustment.</p>
                        <p>6. I count on you to give me your completely candid comments on this
                            message. I know the subtle but important differences that do exist
                            between the U.S. and Vietnamese views of things.</p>

                            problem is the timing. I feel that he will be most useful in talking to
                            the principal members of the new government after they are installed and
                            hence should arrive after its composition has been announced. If he
                            arrives before that time, he will not know whom to talk to. Even if the
                            fact of his impending visit is announced before the formation of the
                            government, the news might cause <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to hold up decisions in order to be the only actor

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might seize on the
                            news as evidence of further U.S. interference in internal matters of

                            as the defender of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> sovereignty. I
                            would recommend no announcement of <persName>Bundy</persName>'s trip

                        <p>Whatever statement is made on his departure, I would like it to include

                            just received <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 1548<note n="4" xml:id="d45fn4">
                                <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note> on the subject of
                            evacuation which raises certain questions, not presently clear, but
                            which may be covered in a supplementary telegram which I understand is
                            en route. If time permits, I would like to withhold decision on
                            evacuation until we have talked with <persName>Bundy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>With regard to a visit by Lodge, I have considerable reservations. The
                            sending of a special U.S. emissary to the leaders of the Buddhist
                            Institute at this time will greatly enhance their prestige, already
                            inflated by their victory over Huong and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. These political bonzes have been and still are
                            attacking the U.S. Ambassador because the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ventured to continue to support a government which they
                            had decided to pull down and, to show further their displeasure, have
                            conducted anti-American demonstrations and destroyed U.S. property.
                            While all this has been taking place, Buddhist spokesmen have been
                            making veiled statements which have earned them a country-wide
                            reputation as probable neutralists. The picture of an American of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s stature coming around
                            the world to confer with them in their triumph somehow goes against my
                            grain and may raise suspicions in a highly suspicious country that the
                            U.S. is trafficking with neutralists. Even these unpleasant consequences
                                <pb xml:id="pg_101" n="101" facs="0133"/>would be tolerable if frank
                            discussions offered any hope of changing the course which <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and company are following.
                            Would it be reasonable to propose that we await the outcome of
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s visit before deciding about <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>?</p>

                            <item>Discussion With General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> accompanied me
                            to Da Nang in the T-39 today. This trip stemmed from a request made to
                            General Moore through General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>.
                            During the flight up we had a lengthy discussion summarized in the
                            following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>2. I told General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> that I
                            was going to Da Nang primarily to look into the alleged report that
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> soldiers had participated in
                            the demonstration in Hue on Wednesday, which demonstration reportedly
                            had an anti-government and anti-U.S. objective. This situation I viewed
                            with grave alarm and concern and suspected that he was conducting an
                            investigation to determine why such extreme breach of discipline and
                            unacceptable conduct for an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            soldier would be tolerated. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said he shared my concern and was having the
                            matter investigated in detail. He agreed to give me a copy of the report
                            of investigation.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> explained that he was
                            going to Da Nang on political business—distasteful to him but necessary
                            under the circumstances. He expected to return to his military duty in
                            ten days when new government would be formed. His commanders shared his
                            distaste for politics but as a group they felt there was no one else
                            capable of stemming the tide of deterioration in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. He had met for four days and nights with the Armed
                            Forces Council and they had agreed that there were two essentials of
                            success in this country:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0134"/>
                        <p>a. A government supported by the people.</p>
                        <p>b. The support of the United States.</p>
                        <p>4. Upon questioning the motives of the Buddhists, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said he had made a secret
                            agreement with the Bonzes which he expected them to fulfill. This
                            involved removing the Buddhist chaplains from the Armed Forces (this is
                            part of a general policy to remove all chaplains which he stated was
                            also acceptable to the Catholics); the Buddhist Institute would get out
                            of politics; <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Ho Giac</persName> would leave the
                            country; and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] would exile himself in a pagoda to pursue his
                            religious studies. If the Bonzes continued to create trouble, he would
                            be forced to take strong measures against them, if necessary “kill”
                            them.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> personally plans to
                            appoint the members of the Armed Forces and People's Council (some may
                            be “good” members of the former High National Council) which
                            organization will select the Chief of State who will in turn appoint a
                            Prime Minister and subsequently form a Cabinet acceptable to the Armed
                            Forces Council. He expects both the Chief of State and the Prime
                            Minister to be civilians and would prefer such an arrangement, although
                            I received the impression that Khanh could easily change his views in
                            this regard. The new government would be staunchly backed by the Armed
                            Forces. The Armed Forces would retain the ministerial posts recently
                            acquired plus that of the Minister of Interior.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> does not expect any
                            particular trouble from the Catholics since he had talked to Catholic
                            leader, Bishop Binh, who had agreed to lend his support to his efforts
                            to stabilize the situation. He was prepared to deal forcibly with the
                            students if they create trouble.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has not made his plans
                            public but intends to do so. His first step in this regard was at his
                            press conference yesterday where he attempted to pave the way for
                            further public explanation of his approach at later conferences.</p>
                        <p>8. If his efforts to form a new government are unsuccessful and
                            destructive elements attempt to destroy his country, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> says he will have no choice but
                            to take over as a military dictator.</p>
                        <p>9. I expressed my concern about the anti-Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> theme in recent demonstrations
                            in Hue<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">Signs denouncing <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> as a lackey of Prime
                                Minister Huong appeared throughout Hue on January 23, the same day
                                that a mob attacked the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                                Library in Hue. (Westmoreland, <hi rend="italic">A Soldier
                                    Reports</hi>, p. 95)</note> and Da Nang, pointed out that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was perhaps
                            the best friend Vietnam ever had but more fundamentally an attack on the
                            Ambassador was an attack on the United States Government since he was
                            the official representative of the United States. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said he well understood and
                            stated that one reason <pb xml:id="pg_103" n="103" facs="0135"/>that he
                            was going to Da Nang was to explain this matter plus the fact that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> supported the
                            government of Vietnam and therefore its head. In the past, the U.S.
                            Ambassador had supported Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, General <persName>Minh</persName>, himself, and
                            now Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. The fact that
                            the people in Hue and Da Nang did not like Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> was no basis for disliking
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. “The people
                            are simple minded and follow the old adage, ‘The friend of my enemy is
                            also my enemy’.”</p>
                        <p>10. As we returned to Saigon, General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> stated that he had spoken with approximately forty
                            leaders from the northern provinces representing all political and
                            religious factions and students. He had spoken for over an hour and then
                            answered questions for another hour. He had urged them not to show
                            animosity against Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> because of his support of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> in his capacity as the head of
                            government. He emphasized that the United States supports the government
                            of Vietnam and not individuals. He thought his remarks were understood,
                            well received, and accepted. He assured me that all “anti-Taylor signs”
                            would be down or painted over in both Hue and Da Nang by morning.</p>

                        <p>1. The President sends thanks for your 2334<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">
                                <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> and so do I. I look
                            forward very much to visiting you. President sees force of your argument
                                <pb xml:id="pg_104" n="104" facs="0136"/>that my visit should not
                            come when there is no government to talk with. On the other hand, it
                            looks to us as if General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            for better or for worse is the principal present power. We see no early
                            prospect of solid and stable administration, no matter what happens in
                            the next few days. In order to get on with our own thinking about next
                            steps, it does seem important for me to come quickly, although delay of
                            a day or two beyond proposed arrival February 2 is manageable if you
                            think it wise. As for <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot
                            Lodge</persName>, we are inclined to accept your judgment.</p>
                        <p>2. It remains clear to us that however irresponsible they may be,
                            Buddhist leaders as well as <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> himself are essential elements in our problem, and
                            we now wonder whether there are any Americans of lower visibility that
                            might be worth bringing along or even sending ahead for the purpose of
                            quiet and informal soundings with them or with generals. We may have
                            further suggestions on this and would allow any you may have.</p>
                        <p>3. We do not have to decide departure time until 24 hours ahead, but
                            would like your advice daily until decision made.</p>
                        <p>4. On the evacuation of dependents, the President's view is that it is
                            not the timing of the decision but the decision itself that is important
                            to him. He wants his people here and in Saigon to work out together the
                            best way of clearing the decks, and is quite willing to have final
                            decision on timing and method await my visit and talks with you.</p>
                        <p>5. A lot will turn on your first talk with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. We think you should certainly seek from him a
                            firm statement of determination to carry on with the war, and if, as we
                            would expect, he takes this position, we think you should certainly
                            respond that US is equally determined to go on supporting Vietnamese
                            government and people. You could then make use of plan for DeSoto patrol
                            next week as indication our position. Object of meeting should be to
                            establish firmness of both sides and create atmosphere that would begin
                            to bury past problems and get us into position to talk hard with him on
                            all subjects including evacuation when I come or earlier if you think
                            wise. So far we have been holding off on public statement our continued
                            support, but we think we should make this just as soon as Khanh has made
                            right noise to you. If trend of talk is in this direction, you are
                            authorized join with Khanh in joint statement at time of call if you
                                desire.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">In telegram 2347 from Saigon,

                            conversation with North Vietnamese [garble], essentially to three
                            questions put by French (1) Would Hanoi accept and join in guarantees
                            for neutral and completely independent South Vietnam? (2) Would Hanoi
                            agree to knock off political and military subversion in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> 0135? <pb xml:id="pg_106" n="106" facs="0138"/>(3) Would Hanoi accept some control mechanism more

                            <persName corresp="#p_MVBR1">Mai Van Bo</persName> showed considerable
                            interest in (1) and (3) and spoke of settling on basis 1954 Geneva
                            Accords but was obviously embarrassed and evasive on (2), since
                            affirmative response would have constituted confession. French told Bo
                            frankly they could not accept Vietnamese protestations that there was
                            only American intervention and that French were convinced of Hanoi
                            subversive role. If Hanoi did not wish to own up, would they at least
                            undertake guarantee not to engage in such activities in future?</p>
                        <p>At second meeting in January above questions explored further and French
                            said that in order to discuss meaningfully, Bo should obtain precise
                            answers from Hanoi on above three points. No answer yet received.</p>
                        <p>Similar line taken with Chinese Charge but less precisely, since
                            discussion did not get much below shallows of Chinese reiterations of
                            principle and calls for unilateral withdrawal of US (which solely to
                            blame) from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as only basis for
                            settlement. Charge described ChiCom contacts with US in Warsaw in terms

                            given their estimate our position somewhat along lines of

                            conference. French also said it was clearly unrealistic to expect

                            clear cut victory for Saigon and US, it was equally illusory to believe

                                <persName corresp="#p_CANG1">Cang</persName>, the CNO, and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAO1">Cao</persName>, the Secretary General of
                            the Armed Forces Council. He asked if these two officers could be
                            present and we readily agreed. This is a new development and probably
                            reflects the desire of the other generals to have a third party account
                            of Khanh's interviews with the Americans.</p>
                        <p>We opened the discussion by asking <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> how we were to understand his statements on
                            governmental procedure contained in Ref A with those made at his press
                            conference, Reference B. In the ensuing discussion, the following facts
                            were established:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> says that his statements
                            at the press conference were deliberately made to veil his ultimate
                            intention which is to carry out the procedures outlined in Reference A.
                            However, to have announced this fact at <pb xml:id="pg_108" n="108" facs="0140"/>yesterday's press conference would have had the effect
                            of labeling the ensuing government as Khanh's project. Hence, he
                            preferred to outline the governmental organization which actually exists
                            today without referring to what he hopes it will become later.</p>
                        <p>He says that he is on the following schedule. By the end of this week, he
                            will have chosen the members of the Civilian-Military Council. This is
                            the 20-man body which will include representation from what he calls the
                            five pressure groups—the armed forces, the Buddhists, the Catholics, the
                            Hoa Hao and Cao Dai. Additionally, there will be six “Notables”, two
                            chosen from the north, center and south of Viet-Nam. Once this body is
                            formed as a consultative organ of the AFC, he expects the members to
                            recommend to him the procedure contained in Ref A. Thus, the new
                            government will come about at the recommendation of this body broadly
                            representative of the principal national groupings. Once this
                            recommendation is made to the <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss>, it
                            will be quickly accepted and the procedure will be carried out whereby
                            the Civilian-Military Council will pick a Chief of State who in turn
                            will pick a Prime Minister who will then present a new government to the
                            Civilian-Military Council for approval. In short, the Civilian-Military
                            Council will act as a reconstituted High National Council.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> believes that all this
                            can be done by the end of next week even though the Tet holidays
                            intervene.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> alluded to the obvious difficulty of
                            getting good men to come into a government which the public understands
                            will last only until elections. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> thinks this difficulty can be overcome, pointing
                            out that the Civilian-Military Council may recommend a postponement of
                            elections. In this case, the new government might continue indefinitely,
                            even if elections are held, since the provisions of the old charter
                            still govern which require a two-thirds majority in the National
                            Assembly in order to remove the existing government.</p>
                        <p>I asked about the Buddhist attitude toward this program—were they
                            satisfied? Khanh seems to be sure that they will be, although it is far
                            from clear to us why the Institute would be satisfied with only two
                            representatives in the total of 20 of the Civilian-Military Council. I
                            asked further about the status of the “treaty” between the armed forces
                            and the institute (Reference C). <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> says that the treaty is still valid although
                            certainly the government which it is discussing looks nothing like the
                            all-military dictatorship referred to in the “treaty”. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> says that this was the extreme
                            case and since the Buddhists had indicated a willingness to support such
                            a military dictatorship, they certainly would be satisfied with a
                            government considerably less drastic in form. He repeated that he
                            expects <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Ho Giac</persName> to leave the country and
                            <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> to go into a remote
                            pagoda. Prior to these actions, the Institute would presumably choose
                            new leadership.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_109" n="109" facs="0141"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> talked at some length
                            about the need to eliminate the Buddhist chaplains from the armed forces
                            since they were a source of subversion. He has in mind removing all
                            chaplains of all faiths, at least for a period of some months. He
                            anticipates difficulties with the Catholics in getting agreement, but by
                            appealing to their patriotism he is hopeful.</p>
                        <p>We then talked at some length about the problems in the Hue-Danang area.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is clearly concerned
                            about the situation there which results, he says, from the traditional
                            spirit of regionalism which dominates the provinces around Hue. I told
                            him that we had viewed very seriously the anti-American demonstrations
                            in that area and that I felt I had probably made a mistake in not
                            withdrawing all Americans during that period. Even now although
                            tranquillity had been restored for the moment, the same disruptive
                            factors are present in Hue. Hence, I felt obliged to give continued
                            consideration to the need to evacuate at least U.S. dependents from that
                            part of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> tried to explain away the
                            anti-U.S. demonstrations as of limited importance and reacted strongly
                            to the suggestion of withdrawing dependents. He urged me not to be
                            precipitate and at least to wait until after Tet, thus providing a pause
                            for the calming of emotions. After Tet, he suggested that we consult
                            together again on the matter.</p>
                        <p>I agreed that it was important to move slowly but undertook no commitment
                            to act one way or another.</p>
                        <p>We then talked about the public attitude which the Embassy should take
                            toward the government. I told him that it was impossible to be more
                            explicit at this time than to say that we were continuing routine
                            operations with the interim government. Meanwhile we were waiting to see
                            what government would emerge in a more permanent form. He agreed that
                            this attitude was reasonable but showed concern that the public
                            understand that we were in contact with him again. I told him that it
                            was routine for us to inform the press at the end of the day whom I had
                            visited in the government and that such an announcement would be made
                            today. We would not indicate, however, the discussion of any specific
                            items. Khanh agreed to this proceeding.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> then talked somewhat
                            about the future form which he had in mind for the government. He is
                            thinking of forming the ministries into three groups, one including
                            Defense, Information and Interior to constitute the war-making bloc; a
                            second, a Finance and Economics bloc; and the remaining ministries (less
                            Foreign Affairs and Justice) categorized as the development bloc.
                            Foreign Affairs and Justice would report directly to the Prime Minister.
                            We made no particular comment upon this proposed organization other than
                            to mention the desirability of keeping the Bureau of the Budget directly
                            under the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_110" n="110" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>In general, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> tried to paint
                            to us a picture of the armed forces thoroughly in control of the
                            situation and ready to deal with the Buddhist Institute as one of
                            several power groups which must be taken into account in the formation
                            of a government. I told him that the situation was being viewed quite
                            differently abroad where the overthrow of the Huong government is being
                            interpreted as a Buddhist Institute victory over a government supported
                            by the United States. Since no one believes that the Buddhist Institute
                            could have done this alone, it is a natural inference that the armed
                            forces were allied with the Buddhist Institute in sabotaging Huong.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> insists that coming
                            events will soon disprove this theory and that the Buddhist leaders will
                            be shelved, as was Huong. I told him that this would be all to the good
                            when it occurred but meanwhile we should all be thinking about ways and
                            means of dispelling the impression of a Buddhist Institute victory which
                            may be the first step toward a neutralist government.</p>
                        <p>We are not at all sure whether <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> really believes that he can carry out the program
                            which he has outlined to us. Even if sincerely committed to it, he is
                            going to encounter difficulties in setting up the Civilian-Military
                            Council, in getting it to act in accordance with his behest, and finally
                            in obtaining suitable ministers for the new government.</p>
                        <p>It may be that he recognizes these facts but wants to make the visible
                            effort. If he fails he can always say that he tried and continue to live
                            with present interim government. The composition of the latter must be
                            particularly appealing to him, with vague old man Suu and Chief of State
                            and pliable “Jack” Oanh as acting Prime Minister. We can think of no
                            better lineup from his point of view to allow indirect control of the
                            government by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and his
                            generals.</p>

                            effective relationships with him should he make his coup stick. At same

                            and to provide their current views and recommendations. Initially, the

                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> for the attack on the
                            Bien Hoa Airfield. In addition, by <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–955–64, dated 14 November 1964,<note n="6" xml:id="d51fn6">Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d411">Document 411</ref>.</note> the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff advised that they considered the reprisals recommended
                            for the Bien Hoa incident equally applicable for any subsequent
                            provocation of a similar nature in Southeast Asia. The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff on 28 December 1964, by <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–1076–64,<note n="7" xml:id="d51fn7">Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d472fn3">footnote 3, Document 472</ref>.</note> again
                            recommended an air attack be conducted against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as a reprisal for the Brink <gloss target="#t_BOQ1">BOQ</gloss> bombing incident.</p>
                        <p>5. The lack of US response to major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attacks against US
                            personnel and forces in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> could be
                            misconstrued, with the result that further anti-US incidents could take
                            place, to include attacks against US dependents. The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff have noted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s views and agree with him that reprisal actions
                            should be taken to dampen further terrorist acts.</p>
                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the next such significant
                            provocation should be met with a positive, timely, and appropriate
                            response in order to demonstrate to the DRV that these provocations will
                            bring prompt and destructive response from the United States. Reprisals
                                <pb xml:id="pg_113" n="113" facs="0145"/>should be undertaken,
                            preferably within twenty-four hours, against selected targets in the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces should be used to the extent feasible.</p>
                        <p>7. As you are aware, US military forces can respond to provocations on
                            short notice. To apprise you of military planning actions, a resume of
                            possible reprisal actions of varying intensities for which US plans are
                            available for execution in a minimum of time is contained in Appendix
                                B.<note n="8" xml:id="d51fn8">Attached but not printed.</note> This
                            resume sets forth strike forces available for reprisal actions in both
                            Laos and North Vietnam, together with the target designations and
                            sorties required for four preplanned actions.</p>
                        <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. A US reprisal with <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> participation
                            as feasible be taken for the next significant provocative act.</p>
                        <p>b. This action be initiated promptly, preferably within twenty-four
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>In order to reduce the time involved in the decision-making process, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff will, insofar as practicable, recommend reprisal
                            actions based upon the actions contained in Appendix B.<note n="9" xml:id="d51fn9">In a February 4 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> replied that he had noted the

                        <p>1. Thanks for your 2348<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Dated January 29.
                                (Ibid.)</note> confirming plans for visit. This message deals with
                            preliminary thoughts for our talks.</p>
                        <p>2. I hope we can avoid extended organized briefings. I do not learn well
                            that way, and in any case the point of this visit is to get a chance to
                            exchange thoughts with you on hard fundamental future problems. The more
                            time we can spend in very small groups on these central problems the
                            better.</p>
                        <p>3. Nevertheless I think we need to compare our pictures of the existing
                            situation and especially of two basic elements of it. First, how is the
                            struggle against the Viet Cong going? In this we need to look (1) at
                            Viet Cong capabilities now and in the future, (2) at present and future
                            prospects for our pacification efforts, and (3) at state of Vietnamese
                            morale, civil and military. Washington is assuming that the course of
                            this contest has been generally unfavorable for more than a year and
                            that in the absence of major changes it is likely to get worse. If in
                            your view this assumption is wrong, we need to work hard on this
                            specific question.</p>
                        <p>4. The other central aspect of current situation is the present and
                            future prospect for “stable government.” Present directives make such a
                            government an essential prerequisite for important additional U.S. major
                            action, but we now wonder whether this requirement is either realistic
                            or necessary. If not, then we need to consider what actions are possible
                            both within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and against the North
                            while <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> lacks desired stability. We
                            also need to consider what positive or negative effect additional U.S.
                            action may have on this problem. Sample questions are, whether Phase II
                            actions could be used to strengthen GVN and whether U.S. could organize
                            its own efforts at all levels within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            detached from political problems of central government.</p>
                        <p>5. These questions lead away from estimate of present situation to
                            discussion of U.S. courses of action, and in this area we see particular
                            importance in the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Review of our existing efforts within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. One recurrent question here is that of size and shape

                        <p>2369. For <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>. The

                            representing the latest views of the US Mission Council on the subject.
                            It is proposed to use this paper as a basis for discussion during
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s visit to
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Procedure for Announcing Decision To Evacuate
                                Dependents</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The decision has been taken to evacuate all US dependents from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as expeditiously as possible without
                            giving the impression of a US retreat or creating uneasiness among the
                            Vietnamese officials and public. This decision results from a
                            consideration of the following factors:</p>
                        <p>A. A sense of growing potential danger to our dependents from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terrorism and mob violence.</p>
                        <p>B. Need to clear the deck as a preliminary to any extension of military
                            actions in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. The political and psychological effect here and in US of an atrocity
                            committed against dependents which might result in a stampede
                            evacuation.</p>
                        <p>D. Desirability of freeing family heads of any concern for their
                            dependents and of all domestic distractions.</p>
                        <p>E. Desirability of avoiding an increase in the US presence in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> while meeting the continuing need for
                            military reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>2. The foregoing are the honest reasons for reaching the conclusion that
                            the dependents should return home. The problem is how to state our
                            reasons publicly in such a way as to convince <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and our own people <pb xml:id="pg_117" n="117" facs="0149"/>of the reasonableness of our action. We must take into
                            account that the explanation to these audiences requires differing
                            shades of emphasis.</p>
                        <p>3. In discussions with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials, our
                            explanations could cover all the points of paragraph 1 except for any
                            mention of fear of mob violence. It will be most important to be able to
                            emphasize 1B and 1E, stating that there can be no extension of military
                            action until the dependents are gone and that their removal will be more
                            than compensated for by the additional military units and individuals in
                            the approved pipeline. We should ask the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials for advice and cooperation in presenting the
                            case for evacuation to the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> public.</p>
                        <p>4. In consideration of what kind of public statement to make, the
                            following would appear to be the bare bones of the best explanation of
                            our action: “The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> announced today extensive plans and
                            action for 1965 to raise the level of effectiveness of the struggle
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and to clear the boards
                            for possible future contingencies. By agreement between the two
                            governments, the armed forces of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            will be increased as rapidly as possible from about 450,000 to around
                            600,000 and the National Police from 20,000 to over 50,000. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is increasing its military personnel in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> from 23,000 to (this figure may
                            be as high as 32,000, the strength recommended by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and at a minimum for the requirement
                            of this announcement should exceed somewhat 25,300 to compensate for the
                            departure of approximately 2,300 dependents), in order to support the
                            proposed increase in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces and to
                            strengthen the air defense of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. For
                            the latter purpose, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will
                            introduce a battalion of Hawk surface-to-air missiles, the first
                            appearance of this highly effective weapon in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. To offset this increase in the US military population
                            and to assume an increased posture of readiness on the part of the US
                            community, it has been decided progressively to remove all US
                            dependents. Some have already departed and the others will depart as
                            personal plans can be made for their relocation. In combination, the
                            foregoing actions and others in preparation should permit major progress
                            in 1965.”</p>
                        <p>5. The effectiveness of such a statement is weakened by the public
                            knowledge of the recent anti-American demonstrations and our known
                            concern over the safety of our dependents in Hue. The American press, in
                            particular, will probably bear down on this point and try to make it
                            appear the real reason for our action. We can try to temper this
                            reaction by background briefings but they are not likely to be effective
                            unless we can be fairly explicit about the meaning of “clearing the
                            boards.”</p>
                        <p>6. The foregoing procedure is the best treatment of a highly sensitive
                            problem which the US mission can suggest. It is predicated on Washington
                            agreement to the following points:</p>
                        <p>A. The military reinforcements mentioned are definitely approved and will
                            be carried out.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_118" n="118" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>B. There is a firm intention to carry the war to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> following the evacuation of
                            dependents.</p>
                        <p>C. As agreed in Deptel 1509,<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">
                                <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> the evacuation may be

                        <p>1. Moscow's decision to send an unusually strong delegation headed by
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to Hanoi
                            underscores both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s desire to
                            regain influence with the North Vietnamese and its concern over the
                            possibility of escalation in the Indochina conflict. One of the main
                            purposes of this mission probably will be to strengthen the credibility
                            of repeated public statements since late November that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> “cannot remain indifferent to the
                            fate of a fraternal socialist country” and that it is ready to give
                            Hanoi the “necessary assistance.”</p>
                        <p>2. The presence of high-ranking military and economic officials on the
                            delegation almost certainly foreshadows a substantial increase in Soviet
                            economic and military assistance. This aid may well include such
                            defensive weapons as surface-to-air missiles, antiaircraft weapons, and
                                <pb xml:id="pg_119" n="119" facs="0151"/>naval torpedo and patrol
                            craft. It is also possible, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will offer advanced jet fighters.</p>
                        <p>3. A Soviet economic aid mission headed by M.N. Sulovey, a vice chairman
                            of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, is already in
                            Hanoi to “study implementation” of existing economic aid agreement. Most
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s economic aid under
                            earlier programs is believed to have been utilized. The Soviet Union has
                            extended North Vietnam about $370 million worth of economic aid since
                            1955, mainly in the form of factories and machine shops, power plants,
                            and coal mine equipment. The last major Soviet economic credit—$200
                            million—was extended in 1960 to cover North Vietnam's first five-year
                            plan (1961–1965). New economic aid probably will be designed primarily
                            to provide equipment for projects covered by the second five-year
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>4. The pattern of Soviet and North Vietnamese pronouncements in recent
                            weeks suggests that both parties wish to work toward improving relations
                            which have been rather distant and cool since Hanoi felt obliged to
                            support Peiping in the period since the nuclear test ban treaty of
                            August 1963. It is possible that the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> mission, at the invitation of the North
                            Vietnamese Government, is the culmination of an exchange of views since
                            Khrushchev's downfall, particularly during Premier <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName>'s visit to Moscow last
                            November. <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>'s junket
                            apparently was intended as a fishing expedition to see what could be
                            expected of the new Kremlin bosses in support of North Vietnamese
                            objectives. It has been evident since his return that the North
                            Vietnamese were intent on softening at least the public manifestations
                            of their opposition to Soviet policy. A hard-hitting anti-Soviet piece,
                            for example, was hastily scratched from the party journal Hop Tac last
                            November, a few days after <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>'s return. Subsequent developments, including the
                            appearance of Soviet antiaircraft guns in North Vietnam, the harder
                            Soviet propaganda line on the Indochina situation, and the dispatch of a
                            major Moscow economic delegation to Hanoi, make it appear that
                                <persName>Pham Van Dong</persName> probably received assurances of
                            increased Soviet military, economic, and political assistance from the
                            new leaders in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>5. It was not mere coincidence that almost simultaneously with Moscow's
                            announcement of the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            delegation, the leading North Vietnamese party paper published an
                            editorial welcoming this visit in unusually warm terms. It expressed
                            gratitude for past Soviet assistance and voiced “warm and profound
                            sentiments toward the Soviet Communists” and for their “spirit of
                            proletarian internationalism.”</p>
                        <p>6. In addition to more favorable prospects for improving relations with
                            Hanoi, the decision to send the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> mission probably was motivated by growing Soviet
                            concern that both sides in the Indochina conflict may be contemplating
                            actions which could lead to a rapid escalation of the war. Over the past
                            two months, the Soviets appear to have <pb xml:id="pg_120" n="120" facs="0152"/>been searching for means of inhibiting the actions of
                            both antagonists. An upsurge in Soviet diplomatic and propaganda
                            attention to the Indochina conflict coincided with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s consultations in Washington
                            in late November and early December and with the movement of substantial
                            numbers of North Vietnamese troops into Laos in December. Soviet
                            uncertainty and concern regarding US intentions probably was heightened
                            not only by US air strikes against the infiltration routes in Laos but
                            by a more general feeling that the US may be impelled to adopt more
                            far-reaching military measures in an attempt to check the erosion in
                            South Vietnam. One of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s main purposes in his talks with US leaders in
                            December apparently was to probe for signs of US plans which might lead
                            to escalation and also for indications of Washington's attitude toward
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>7. The Soviet leaders almost certainly hope that a substantial increase
                            in economic and military assistance to North Vietnam will enable them to
                            press for a greater voice in the formulation of Communist policy in
                            South Vietnam and Laos. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            probably will argue that the Viet Cong campaign is progressing
                            satisfactorily and that North Vietnam should avoid actions which might
                            provoke US reprisals. He may also discuss political initiatives designed
                            to inhibit US freedom of action, such as greater pressure toward
                            reconvening the 14-nation conference on Laos.</p>
                        <p>8. The presence of party secretary Andropov on the delegation suggests
                            that the Soviets will exchange views on the general situation in the
                            world Communist movement and set forth their plans for the proposed
                            meeting of the Communist “editorial commission” in Moscow on 1 March.
                            The North Vietnamese have maintained silence on the March meeting. The
                            Soviets, however, may not have abandoned hope completely that Hanoi will
                            decide to participate. In any event, the Soviets undoubtedly would feel
                            they had nothing to lose by renewing assurances that they had no
                            intention of “excommunicating” the Chinese and that the only purpose of
                            the meeting is to discuss means of restoring Communist unity.</p>
                        <p>9. From Hanoi's standpoint, the growing strain in Hanoi-Moscow relations
                            during Khrushchev's era was primarily a product of Soviet softness in
                            political and propaganda opposition to US action in South Vietnam and
                            Laos. It has always been clear that if Moscow were to firm up its
                            support of North Vietnamese policy objectives in Indochina, Hanoi would
                            tend to moderate the degree of its open support for Peiping in the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute, and once again attempt to play up its assumed role
                            of “honest broker” seeking to bring at least an operative unity between
                            Peiping and Moscow.</p>
                        <p>10. It is unlikely that an increase in the Soviet presence in North
                            Vietnam will bring about a change of Hanoi's tactics in prosecuting the
                            Viet <pb xml:id="pg_121" n="121" facs="0153"/>Cong war. Although
                            factional differences appear to exist in the North Vietnamese party over
                            certain areas of policy, it has always appeared that the party was
                            basically united on the tactics to be used in the Viet Cong insurgency.
                            The so-called “extremists” in the North Vietnamese party seemed most to
                            resent the lack of political and propaganda support from Moscow over
                            South Vietnam. More vigorous Soviet backing of Hanoi may tend to reduce
                            the differences between the factions.</p>
                        <p>11. Moscow's desire to reassure the US that the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> mission to Hanoi does not
                            signal an abrupt shift in Soviet policy was apparent in an authoritative
                            Pravda “observer” article of 31 January on President <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>'s State of the Union message. In sharp contrast to the
                            negative tone of Moscow's initial reaction, Pravda for the first time
                            warmly welcomed the President's remarks about expanding US-Soviet
                            contacts.</p>

                            reviewed by President with visiting team. We recognize the hazards in
                            striving for too much precision in the agenda and in over-organizing the

                            our interests rather than hard and fast requirements.</p>
                        <p>In general, I am primarily interested in coming away with a sense of what
                            kind of pressures you and your senior subordinates feel can be
                            effectively applied to the VC and Hanoi. In this connection, I want to
                            get your views without any constraints you may feel are imposed by
                            existing policy or moods anywhere. For this reason, I am anxious that
                            our discussions will be informal, uninhibited and as leisurely as we can
                            realistically make them.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_122" n="122" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>Specifically, with respect to Topic I, I wonder whether we can postpone
                            “E” and “F” until we talk about Topic III.<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">Topic I was “Progress of Struggle Against Viet Cong.” Topic III was
                                “Extension of War Beyond <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.”
                                Subtopics III E and F were “Ways and Means for Initiating Phase II”
                                and “Necessary Preliminaries for Initiating Phase II—Political,
                                Military.”</note> It may well be, in fact, that we will want to save
                            a definitive discussion of our future military and political policy and
                            posture until we have disposed of most, if not all, of the other
                            topics.</p>
                        <p>Re Topic II,<note n="4" xml:id="d56fn4">“Stability of Government.”</note>
                            while the subject and the sub-topics all seem worthwhile, I hope that
                            the discussion will be focused on what to me seems a basic question: Do
                            we in fact need a stable government in order to proceed aggressively and
                            effectively with pacification? Or to put it another way, how can we step
                            up our pacification effort on the assumption that there will not be a
                            stable government?</p>
                        <p>Re Topic III, I would like to pose for inclusion here the pre-emptive
                            positioning of US and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>-member
                            forces along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or elsewhere as
                            appropriate as part of a Phase II action. (The Australians have
                            expressed keen interest in this and we would like to get your views.) I
                            am especially interested in your views re “III-F Political” and hope
                            that we will leave ample time to discuss this.</p>
                        <p>As far as Topic IV<note n="5" xml:id="d56fn5">“Other Possible Courses of
                                Action.”</note> is concerned, I wonder whether it is necessary to
                            discuss this as a separate item. If a <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>-controlled government has some staying power and
                            is reasonably effective, I think we're probably stuck with it. If it
                            does not, we run into some of the nasties in your Topic VIII<note n="6" xml:id="d56fn6">“Contingency Planning Against Unpleasant Political
                                or Military Developments.”</note> and can face up to the problems at
                            that point.</p>
                        <p>The President has expressed particular interest in Topic V (Evacuation)
                            and in your 2369<note n="7" xml:id="d56fn7">
                                <ref target="#d54">Document 54</ref>.</note> on this subject. The
                            President will come to a definite decision on this question upon our
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Re Topic VI,<note n="8" xml:id="d56fn8">“Third Country Programs.”</note>
                            I think that one or two of my colleagues can deal with many of the
                            aspects and problems of third country aid prior to our discussion and
                            consequently we probably will be able to dispose of the subject in very
                            short order. In essence, I want to acquire a feel as to whether, all
                            things considered, the overall benefits are worth the local costs, and
                            whether and how much we should continue to solicit more help.</p>
                        <p>Re Topic VIII, two nitpicks: I wonder if we should put much effort in
                                “D”;<note n="9" xml:id="d56fn9">“Shape of U.S. Negotiating
                                Position.” Subtopic VIII-D was “A Major Communist Initiative for a
                                New Geneva Conference and ‘Negotiated Solution’.”</note> rather, I
                            think we should give a bit of thought to the contingency of <pb xml:id="pg_123" n="123" facs="0155"/>a fast deterioration involving
                            a US withdrawal and/or a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the specific points for discussion, a few other matters are
                            worth noting: (1) Included in our party will be General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> who is coming at the

                            planning for any wider action.</p>
                        <p>(2) I am a bit worried about the three “receptions.” Can we eliminate the
                            one for the Diplomatic Corps? I do want to meet the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> politicos and generals, however.</p>
                        <p>(3) I plan to take your advice and stay one extra day for the purpose of
                            getting out into the country. I assume that Sunday<note n="10" xml:id="d56fn10">February 7.</note> will be the best day for
                            this.</p>
                        <p>(4) I will make a bland arrival statement and have a press backgrounder
                            on departure. (We will prepare and forward arrival statement here based

                            important its position be made discreetly known to generals.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CAO1">Cao</persName> said his conviction that

                            Buddhists and plan to lead country to neutralism reinforced by long
                            lecture which <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had Tuoc
                            deliver to generals at Vung Tau this past Sunday morning. It came out
                            during lecture that Tuoc had apparently visited some Eastern European
                            states during his trip and burden of his remarks was that primary US
                            interest and concern was in Europe, there was growing opposition in US
                            to involvement in Vietnam, etc., so that likely US would withdraw
                            shortly and thus Vietnamese must now move to stand on their own feet. In
                            response to <persName>Johnson</persName>'s question as to what would
                            have been <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s attitude on

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Although the info reported in reftel may not be a true blueprint of
                            coming events, it does have enough plausibility to warrant us deciding
                            now what attitude we should take to a new govt headed by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. My following comments have in
                            mind such a takeover under circumstances suggested by reftel but are
                            generally applicable to the broad question of whether we can do business
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as the controlling
                            partner of a de Gaulle-Pompidou line-up. We know that he has yearned for
                            such an alignment at least since last August and his present alliance
                            with the Buddhists, shaky though it may be, may lead him to believe that
                            now is the moment to try for it. What are the likely consequences of
                            such a move insofar as U.S. interests are concerned?</p>
                        <p>2. First, let us assume that General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> succeeds and establishes himself as Chief of State
                            after the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> model. His
                            ability to stay in power will depend largely upon two groups—the
                            Buddhist Institute leaders and the generals. To keep both groups in line
                            appears to present contradictory requirements. The Buddhist leaders will
                            not long be satisfied <pb xml:id="pg_127" n="127" facs="0159"/>with a
                            govt which does not comply with their behests and such subservience is
                            likely to offend many of the generals. If <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> does not play along with the Buddhists, sooner or
                            later they can be counted upon to take to the streets and present
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> with the same problem
                            which he faced in August, 1964. At that time, he capitulated quickly
                            under Buddhist pressure to the disgust of ods [his?] generals. If this
                            situation were to be repeated, we would expect the generals to split on
                            the issue of Buddhist domination with unpredictable results other than
                            confusion approaching anarchy.</p>
                        <p>3. Let us suppose that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, in
                            spite of these obvious difficulties, somehow succeeds in keeping the
                            generals in line while satisfying the Buddhists. In that case, the
                            Catholics, the Hoa Hao, the Cao Dai and the other elements generally
                            suspicious of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> can be
                            expected to cause him trouble. Whether their opposition would be
                            sufficient to overthrow his govt may be doubtful but the consequences
                            could well be serious and possibly include bloody outbreaks of religious
                            strife.</p>
                        <p>4. [Garble] combination in which <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is maintained as the governmental leader with
                            Buddhist support. We foresee a likely trend toward neutralism and
                            anti-Americanism. The Buddhists are suspect on both counts and are so
                            notified [<hi rend="italic">identified</hi>?] in the public mind. We
                            know General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s deep
                            feeling about the necessity of Buddhist support and have long suspected
                            him of wishing to become the Sihanouk of South Vietnam able to treat the
                            U.S. with similar disregard.</p>
                        <p>5. In summary, I can see no good coming out of a <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> govt—not even that minimum
                            stability which would allow us to continue the struggle against the Viet
                            Cong and Hanoi at present levels of success. The probable outcomes as we
                            foresee them would be either civil disturbance approaching anarchy or a
                            neutralist <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in a Sihanouk
                            role. Both are unacceptable solutions from the point of view of the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. With this conviction in mind, we next raise the question of how to
                            avoid a <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> govt? Only with
                            the acquiescence of the large majority of the influential generals can
                            he accede to head of state. We know that he is politicking now to see
                            whether he can get the necessary support. Unless the U.S. reps decide to
                            let matters run their course without an attempt to influence them and
                            take the heavy responsibility of doing nothing, it is most important
                            that we communicate a timely message to the generals to persuade them to
                            withhold a vote of confidence for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and to prevent his coming to power. While the
                            exact text of such a communication would have to be tempered carefully
                            to the character of each of the generals contacted, the bare bones of
                            such a message would be that the U.S. Govt will not recognize and will
                            not support a govt headed by General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. It is our opinion that such word conveyed at the
                            proper time to selected generals and perhaps also to certain civil
                            leaders would accomplish our purpose.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_128" n="128" facs="0160"/>
                        <p>7. There is, of course, always the possibility of an unfavorable
                            reaction. The generals might rally to support <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> because of this “foreign
                            pressure.” Then, if in spite of our efforts, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> came into power, we would have
                            to do what we had promised, namely, withdraw recognition from the govt
                            and await developments. It would not be necessary to withdraw all
                            support at once because we would still have the hope that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s opponents would shortly drag
                            him down, although with the danger of civil disorders which has been
                            cited at the outset of this paper.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I feel that the U.S. cannot win with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as Chief of State and that
                            every possible action should be taken to prevent his accession to power.
                            Our main weapon available for this purpose is the use of the message
                            referred to in para 6 above. If we fail, the consequences will be no
                            more serious than if we had not tried. This matter will be made the
                            first item of business with <persName>Bundy</persName>. After a full
                            discussion, I will forward appropriate recommendations.</p>

                            worth, we agree with type of action reported your 2389 to convey to

                            generals. Risk that such a position will come back to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s ears and make him if possible
                            even more difficult to deal with seems outweighed by implication silence
                            would have that we are in fact with him.</p>
                        <p>At same time, we are deeply concerned, as we are sure you are too, at US

                            their own. Such formulation would probably be our later explanation any
                            position we take, and may also be wise to use with any military contacts

                            more strongly than 2389 line to block <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> complete takeover, it would help us to have your
                            judgment on personalities who might emerge worth our backing. In this
                            regard we have in mind obvious disadvantage emergence any heavily “Can
                            Lao remnant” slate which would only exacerbate Buddhist problem.</p>
                        <p>One way of getting our point across to generals would be to play up
                                <persName corresp="#p_LVH1">Le Van Hoach</persName> angle. It could
                            be brought to their attention that <persName corresp="#p_LVH1">Hoach</persName> said last July he was in touch with NLFSVN and
                            implied <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s knowledge and
                            consent this activity. We could stress that we informed <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_LVH1">Hoach</persName>'s reported activity and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> apparently did nothing about
                            it.</p>

                            <item>Discussion with The President re South Vietnam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I told the President that I was exceedingly worried about the developing
                            situation in South Vietnam and that reports received today indicated <pb xml:id="pg_130" n="130" facs="0162"/>the prospect of a more serious
                            and immediate political crisis in Saigon than was earlier anticipated. I
                            explained that all reports from the Embassy and the Station indicated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s arrangements with
                            the Buddhists had come unglued and he apparently was in serious trouble
                            with most of the Generals. Therefore I felt the reports that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s “days or even hours” were
                            numbered were probably true. I therefore concluded that there was a high
                            probability of immediate trouble.</p>
                        <p>I then pointed out to the President the composition of the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> mission, indicating that with
                            the Chief of the Soviet Air Force, the Chief negotiator for aid, and the
                            Chief Civilian Aviation Minister included in this party, leads me to the
                            conclusion <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would offer
                            military equipment, at least for air defense such as surface to air
                            missiles, supplies and materiel to continue and intensify insurgency and
                            would provide logistic support. In the final analysis we felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would encourage Hanoi
                            to intensify what they were doing now in the way of subversion,
                            political action and guerrilla activities and to avoid overt military
                            action which would bring a confrontation with the United States. The
                            President read the 2 February Watch Committee Report<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">Not found.</note> and then said, “If you were
                            President of the United States, what would you do about it?”</p>
                        <p>I responded that we must produce a viable Government by breeding
                            acceptable military leadership with the Buddhists and other civilian
                            segments to produce the best possible Government and while this appeared
                            difficult, I did not think it was impossible.</p>
                        <p>I said even with this we could not win the way we were going and
                            therefore we must take military action against North Vietnam. I
                            advocated bombing of selected targets in North Vietnam, starting in the
                            south and working north and carrying the raids on intensively, that is
                            at least one a day. I said that we should gradually work towards the
                            north but should not strike deeply into North Vietnam territory (as
                            advocated by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>) at the start.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if this would not bring in the Chinese Communists in
                            the air or on the ground. I said there was a possibility that they would
                            come in on the ground but they had little capability in the air. I said
                            we had to face this contingency and be prepared to handle any possible
                            development but added that while Chinese Communist ground intervention
                            was a possibility, I did not estimate it as a probability under the
                            course of action advocated.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked that I communicate with Bundy through our Chief
                            of Station and develop immediately a cast of characters that might
                            formulate a compatible Government, i.e., military, Buddhists, etc. <pb xml:id="pg_131" n="131" facs="0163"/>With respect to Catholics, I
                            said they would be difficult to handle but I did not think they would
                            resort to extreme measures unless the Government established in this way
                            represented a threat to the Catholic community.</p>
                        <p>The President questioned me concerning consequences of our withdrawal
                            from Vietnam and I said that it would pave the way toward Communist
                            takeover of all of Southeast Asia. I mentioned current moves in
                            Thailand, the situation in Indonesia, and the probable developments in
                            Malaysia under such circumstances.</p>

                        <p>1. After reviewing all current traffic and today's Watch Report,<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">Not found.</note> I advised the President in a
                            long private discussion<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">See <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note> that there appeared,
                            first, a high probability of continuing political instability in Saigon
                            and that serious dissension existed among the general officers.
                            Secondly, analyzing <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            mission which includes high ranking party officer and officials of
                            Defense, Civil Air Transport and Foreign Economic Relations, we were
                            inclined to predict Soviet assistance to augment subversion and
                            guerrilla activities, that they would warn Hanoi against overt <pb xml:id="pg_132" n="132" facs="0164"/>military moves which would
                            invite U.S. reprisals. President stated that we must exhaust every
                            possibility of assisting the establishment of a Saigon government which
                            would bring together discordant groups, most particularly military and
                            the Buddhists, and felt that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            having had experience in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, might
                            suggest particular military or civilian leaders who could accomplish
                            this objective. President continues to feel that a reasonably viable and
                            stable Saigon government is an essential prerequisite to other actions
                            and asked me to communicate this view to you with the suggestion that
                            you give attention to devising a cast of characters which might be able
                            to accomplish this objective.</p>
                        <p>2. In discussion with my staff, they point out that this is an extremely
                            sensitive problem because of the nationalistic and latent anti-American
                            feeling now existent in Saigon. Furthermore we are not at all sure that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is quite as flat on
                            his back as today's cables indicate. Indeed it is considered possible
                            that he might find his way through the present crisis and come out with
                            some measure of strength. On the other hand, it is obvious that a
                            political crisis precipitated by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s opponents, which caused his removal would, in
                            the absence of constructive planning along the lines mentioned above,
                            create a vacuum in Saigon which would do grave damage to U.S. interests.
                            The President therefore feels that you, in consultation with the Embassy
                            and the Station, should attempt to identify and construct a list of
                            individuals who could be brought together with some assurance they would
                            work together in formulating a government; then to consider how the
                            views so developed could be planted or otherwise communicated in Saigon
                            in an unattributable but effective manner.</p>

                        <p>After reviewing essential elements of situation as reported on February
                            3, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> called for
                            reports on results on contacts with key Vietnamese during the previous
                            evening. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName>, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Manfull</persName> supplied following
                            new information:</p>
                        <p>(a) General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> had been contacted
                            by arrangement previously made and the following two points conveyed
                            attributing them to Embassy (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                                2389):<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">See <ref target="#d60fn2">footnote

                        </p>
                        <p>1) That we are in no way propping up General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> or backing him in any fashion,
                            and</p>
                        <p>2) that we share the concern that General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> says he and his colleagues have about the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> received the information with
                            welcome approval and said he was most happy to hear this expression of
                            U.S. views. He said he would be seeing other members of the Armed Forces
                            Council (<gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss>) on February 4 and would
                            have more information at the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>(b) General <persName corresp="#p_PVD2">Pham Van Dong</persName> had been
                            contacted and a full account of the conversation had been
                                circulated.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">See <ref target="#d58fn2">footnote 2, Document 58</ref>.</note>

                        <p>(c) General Stilwell saw General <persName corresp="#p_MLM1">“Little”
                                Minh</persName> who gave the impression of not being in the inner
                            circle and unable to impart significant information.</p>
                        <p>(d) Colonel Metaxis saw General <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>,
                            Commander II Corps, who conveyed the impression that he had not been
                            contacted by other members of the so-called “watchdog group” of the
                                <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(e) Luong Trong Tuong, Hoa Hao leader and respective Military-Civilian
                            Council (<gloss target="#t_MCC1">MCC</gloss>) member, said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_MCC1">MCC</gloss> had not officially convened as
                            yet but was expected to convene today. He added that he personally would
                            refuse to participate but that Hoa Hao would be represented by two or
                            three others yet to be selected.</p>
                        <p>(f) One member of the <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> had observed
                            that if General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> took a firm
                            position in opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, the floodgates would be open for the other <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> members to line up against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> as to the extent of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s support in the military and as to what form
                                <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> opposition to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might take, it was pointed out
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that:</p>
                        <p>(a) Firm support for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to
                            date has been based primarily in the Marines, Airborne Brigade, Armor
                            and Navy—not the Army;</p>
                        <p>(b) Opposition in the <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would probably take form of a
                            vote of no-confidence in <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            as a candidate for Chief of State and perhaps as Commander-in-Chief;</p>
                        <p>(c) The departure of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> from
                            the scene would still leave problems since the Young Turks as a group
                            were not particularly well-disciplined or responsible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had in the past played the card
                            of strong US backing and apparent lack of any suitable alternative.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> responded in
                            the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> asked whether the
                            U.S. press was under the illusion that the U.S. was backing <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Zorthian</persName> replied that the U.S. press was under no such
                            illusion; however, other members of the international press and a
                            considerable number of the local press believed this to be the case.
                            Therefore, the state of public opinion was somewhat confused on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s failure to obtain a representative <gloss target="#t_MCC1">MCC</gloss> need not impede <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in attempting to dominate the
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> could either
                            force the issue with the <gloss target="#t_MCC1">MCC</gloss> as it
                            exists or he could stand on the status quo with a pliable “Jack”
                                <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> as Acting Prime
                            Minister. The latter was a likely possibility.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then suggested
                            the meeting address two problems:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_135" n="135" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>(1) Should we proceed forthwith in conveying the same message as that
                            conveyed to General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> to other
                            key military officers and to selected civilian personalities;</p>
                        <p>(2) Should we now request of Washington authority to invoke withholding
                            of recognition of a <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            Government should this prove necessary emphasizing at the same time that
                            we would use only minimum U.S. pressure necessary to forestall a
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> bid to become Chief
                            of State.</p>
                        <p>With respect to (1) above it was the consensus that the immediate focus
                            of action rests in the <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> and that
                            approaches to civilians at present should not be made with the possible
                            exception of Nguyen Luu Vien.</p>
                        <p>With respect to (2) above, it was questioned whether it is necessary to
                            request such authority at this time. If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in effect puts in a <gloss target="#t_PNG1">PNG</gloss> for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, it might stop <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> or on the other hand it might backfire. It was
                            noted that there had been various Chiefs of State to date but none have
                            wielded much power. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> observed this was not the basic issue and
                            reviewed in detail the analysis contained in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2391.<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">
                                <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> added there is no magic
                            formula, that we faced the dilemmas set forth in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2391. In response to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>'s question as to
                            how confident the Saigon team was that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s succession to the position of Chief of State
                            would ultimately lead to chaos, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said this was the unanimous view of the
                            Mission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> then referred to
                            the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s
                            position as Commander-in-Chief might be in jeopardy and inquired as to
                            likely successors. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> replied that the prime candidates were
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_PVD2">Pham Van Dong</persName>, and to a lesser degree
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> felt that the first two
                            were well qualified and that <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> was bright, popular with his colleagues and nimble
                            enough to keep himself in an uncommitted position so that he is not
                            swept away in changes of regime. He had done an effective job on
                            previous assignments and could be voted into office by his colleagues,
                            although this is likely to prompt a Buddhist reaction since Thieu is
                            both a Catholic and a Dai Viet. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> believed that General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> also has a role to play in
                            South Viet-Nam but not necessarily at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> inquired whether the
                            Buddhists would not present a problem regardless of what evolved from
                            the current situation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> responded that <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> was on the verge of success in his confrontation
                            with the Buddhists until Generals <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and Thi deliberately withheld military support of
                            the Government in mid-central Vietnam. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> observed that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> had informed <pb xml:id="pg_136" n="136" facs="0168"/>him that the Generals had
                            “learned a lesson” with regard to standing up to the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> asked for an
                            estimate as to what would happen if we pulled out all stops and invoked
                            threat of non-recognition of a <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de
                                Silva</persName> said that it depended a great deal on how we
                            handled the situation. If American views were communicated informally
                            but authoritatively our views would fall on receptive or fertile ground
                            and could force a showdown tomorrow. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            inquired as to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s reaction
                            should information concerning our actions get back to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would undoubtedly try to use it
                            and to play up the anti-American theme to his advantage. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> inquired whether
                            the Generals to whom we would be conveying the “message” would fully
                            understand the reasons lying behind the U.S. statement of views. It was
                            pointed out that this could best be handled by confirming on our part
                            the fears and concerns expressed by the military officers themselves. It
                            was also noted that a communication of our views informally today,
                            following the arrival of the Bundy party, would have a greater impact
                            than similar statements made previously. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested that early action be
                            taken to contact the key military figures believed to be receptive to
                            our views in order to provide the necessary information on which to base
                            judgment as to whether he should request authority from Washington to
                            invoke the non-recognition threat if absolutely necessary. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> emphasized that once
                            a threat was invoked he would have to make good on the threat. It was
                            further noted that the U.S. would be placed in an awkward position
                            should <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> succeed despite
                            U.S. efforts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> stated that the
                            impression in Saigon and in the countryside is that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is now running the country
                            regardless of the position he occupies. The Vietnamese people are
                            becoming more demoralized and discouraged. From his conversation with
                            public spirited citizens, both high and low, it is evident that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is thoroughly
                            distrusted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> believes
                            that regardless of the position <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> holds he will, because of his power, be the
                            effective chief of the ship of state. If we take a longer look regarding
                            the necessity of reorganizing and revitalizing the government, in
                            removing distrust of the government on the part of the people and in
                            getting on with the struggle, it is evident that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> must be removed from positions
                            of power. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> believed
                            that discussion of desirability of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as Chief of State was only formalistic one, since
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> exercised effective
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked whether anyone around the table
                            differed with the above estimates of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> replied that no one from the U.S. Mission
                            disagreed and in fact our objective was not only to prevent <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s becoming Chief of State but
                            to work toward a better government.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> noted that if
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> does not succeed in
                            his ploy to become Chief of State his days are probably numbered as
                            Commander-in-Chief. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked whether it
                            would not be sufficient for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s stock to go down dramatically if he fails in his
                            ploy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Manfull</persName> observed that
                            in this event <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would
                            merely begin again to maneuver to assume power and would create further
                            difficulties and instability in the future. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will never give up in his drive
                            for power. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName> noted
                            that it is significant that recently there has been a decided change of
                            heart among the people who provide <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s base of support—the military.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> inquired as to
                            what evidence exists that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            would tend toward a neutralist solution were he to assume power. It was
                            noted that there was no hard evidence but plenty of smoke, which could
                            be adduced from his alliance with the Buddhists, and activities of his
                            brother-in-law <persName>Pham</persName> [<persName>Phan</persName>?]
                            Quang Tuoc, and the fears of his colleagues. In response to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>'s query, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would try to exploit publicly
                            U.S. interference should he succeed in being appointed Chief of State
                            and we in turn withheld recognition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> noted the possibility
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might be driven
                            faster along the road to a neutralist solution if he becomes aware of
                            U.S. action to block his path to Chief of State. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> replied that he always had a
                            feeling that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> was prepared
                            to consider alternate solutions in any situation. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had accomplished many
                            improvements in the strictly military field (better care for dependents,
                            spot promotions, decorations for valor, etc.) but despite these actions
                            his popularity with his colleagues has continually eroded. In his view
                            the only commander of troops who would support <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in a pinch is the Commander of
                            the Airborne Brigade, <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName> was currently taking
                            great pains to avoid his American counterpart.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then posed the
                            proposition: Should we proceed with conveying the “message” of last
                            evening in the hopes of preventing <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> from obtaining a vote of confidence at the <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> meeting on Friday. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that there was a lot of territory
                            between the statement conveyed yesterday and the flat statement that the
                            U.S. would not recognize a government led by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. He believed there were many
                            things we could say but which would avoid a situation in which <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> could say that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had tried to unseat
                            him. In this connection it was pointed out that in effect the U.S.
                            emissaries were merely associating the U.S. with the views these key
                            military figures had already voiced in opposition to or concern over
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s motivations and
                            intentions. It was recognized, however, that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would undoubtedly become aware
                            of our activities.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_138" n="138" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>It was agreed to proceed with conveying the “message” of the previous
                            evening to selected military officers; namely, Generals <persName corresp="#p_PVD2">Pham Van Dong</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, Linh Quang Vien, <persName corresp="#p_CVV1">Cao Van

                            was further agreed that based on results of conversations with the above
                            officers a decision would be made at the end of the day regarding the
                            necessity to request standby authority from Washington concerning
                            non-recognition of a regime led by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>

                            expressed the following views regarding the evacuation of
                            dependents:</p>
                        <p>1. Until the past few weeks, when mob action and anti-American sentiment
                            have become more menacing, they did not favor the evacuation of
                            dependents at all. They did not and do not favor evacuation because of
                            any risks incident to US reprisal actions; this because they believe the
                            risks in such a case to be quite small. They both favor evacuation now,
                            however, because of the new dangers from mob action.</p>
                        <p>2. They are very concerned about the psychological impact that evacuation
                            of US dependents will have especially in Saigon. They describe the
                            climate in Saigon as irritable and paranoid, with the “fabric stretched
                            tight.” There would be suspicions, despite our declarations that we are
                            clearing the decks, that we are actually preparing to bug out—or,
                            inconsistently, that we anticipate air attacks on Saigon and are
                            removing our loved ones to safe havens. They see the “seeds of panic” in
                            Saigon if the US evacuates dependents.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_139" n="139" facs="0171"/>
                        <p>3. They described the best context for removing dependents as one in
                            which we are initiating “Phase II” and increasing the US forces in
                            Vietnam. (Initiation of Phase II, they say, requires a government here
                            that is “at least able to breathe.”) An acceptable, but soon thin,
                            context would be a reprisal. Absent even one military action to buttress
                            our verbal explanation for the evacuation, they believe that we need a
                            combination of two things—(a) a minimal Vietnamese Government which can
                            help sell the “clearing-the-decks” interpretation and (b) increases in
                            US forces by a number exceeding the number of dependents evacuated.
                            (Even this, they say, would only partially reduce the psychological
                            damage.)</p>
                        <p>4. They fear that we may too soon find ourselves in the worst possible
                            case—one in which we must evacuate after anti-American demonstrations
                            and serious mob threats against US citizens. They foresee such
                            demonstrations and want the dependents already to have been removed.</p>
                        <p>5. They reject as undesirable the idea of keeping wives here while
                            evacuating children. They would not allow working wives to stay. They
                            report that there is unanimity in the mission on this point.</p>
                        <p>6. They think action should be taken now to stop the flow of dependents.
                            Furthermore, they see some merit in closing the dependents' school as of
                            this coming fall. It might be announced this spring; perhaps the
                            building could be used for a hospital.</p>

                        <p>At 3 p.m. on February 4 a meeting was held in the Embassy in Saigon to
                            discuss the progress of the struggle against the Viet Cong. Members of
                            the <persName>Bundy</persName> Mission who participated in the meeting
                            were <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Leonard Unger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Chester Cooper</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Andrew Goodpaster</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_RCJA1">Jack A.

                            Miller indicates that the meeting was devoted mainly to two topics:
                            “Viet Cong Capabilities, Now and Future”; and “<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Capability, Now and Future.” A third topic, “Vietnamese

                        <p>During briefings on Viet Cong capabilities, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> noted that the Viet Cong
                            were stronger and better organized and equipped than a year earlier,
                            while <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Peer de Silva</persName> noted that
                            the Viet Cong had gained ground in the war for population control but
                            that “people's action teams” had been developed to counter <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> efforts. Discussion focused on

                        <p>1. Thank you for your message.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">
                                <ref target="#d62">Document 62</ref>.</note> Only an interim answer
                            is possible overnight, but you should know that the immediate problem
                            does not appear to be more than the quiet prevention of a total
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> takeover which no one
                            here believes would produce kind of government the President wants.</p>
                        <p>2. We have pressed throughout the day to see whether any member of
                            Country Team believes that we can prevent continued deterioration in <pb xml:id="pg_141" n="141" facs="0173"/>the absence of a “reasonably
                            effective and stable government.” The Country Team appears to share the
                            President's judgement that such a government is necessary on all counts.
                            Getting it is something else again.</p>
                        <p>3. In particular, I think you should tell the President that a day of
                            inquiry reveals no present prospect of a government acceptable to us
                            which would also be acceptable to the leaders of the Buddhist Institute.
                            The current situation among non-Communists forces gives all the
                            appearances of a civil war within a civil war.</p>
                        <p>4. In this situation, the construction of a government of national unity
                            may well require sharp confrontation with Buddhists before, during, or
                            after the construction job.</p>

                            fertile ground and sensing need for broader coverage today, I authorized
                            similar message to be conveyed discreetly to seven other key generals.
                            We have not yet heard their reactions thereto but will have round-up at
                            end of day. Unless there is fairly clear indication that some stronger
                            action on our part is necessary to give reasonable assurance that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will not be choice

                            present likelihood of requiring authority mentioned in Ref A).</p>
                        <p>We should not be under any illusion about possibility of maintaining
                            secrecy of these contacts we have made or to believe that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will not perceive our
                            action. Except for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s
                            reaction, I would not anticipate any flare-up from other generals who,
                            during show-down with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            last August, were openly seeking US position with regard to retention of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. Fact that we
                            supported him at that time was subject for open discussion in their
                            debates. Hence, I am not particularly concerned now over an excessively
                            conspicuous showing of US hand.</p>
                        <p>With regard to possible successors to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, three leading candidates in our judgment remain
                                <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>, Cong and <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>. We would not rule out
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> but his
                            absence from scene makes him definitely dark horse.</p>
                        <p>In concentrating attention on possible selection of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>-type Chief of State, we have perhaps commented
                            insufficiently on possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will prefer to keep <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and “Jack” Owen in office and continue to pull
                            strings from behind. This situation will not require sudden and dramatic
                            action on our part but will present us with problem which cannot be
                            allowed drag indefinitely. I can well visualize necessity at some time
                            of utilizing full US leverage to include that mentioned in Ref B) to
                            induce our Vietnamese friends to get <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> out of <pb xml:id="pg_143" n="143" facs="0175"/>position of Commander-in-Chief (from which he pulls the strings) and
                            to install their very best governmental line-up.</p>

                        <p>1. Significance of the Immediate Situation. Recent events in Saigon
                            underline the fact that apart from the Communists—and the US
                            presence—the two primary political forces in South Vietnam today are the
                            military establishment and the political bonzes who direct the “Buddhist
                            movement.” At present, US political leverage appears to be at a low
                            point.</p>
                        <p>2. Neither the military nor the Buddhist leadership is homogeneous or
                            monolithic; both suffer from factionalism and personal rivalries.
                            Dominant power obviously rests with the military, but the Buddhists are
                            strong enough to make unworkable any set of political <pb xml:id="pg_144" n="144" facs="0176"/>arrangements their leaders care
                            to oppose. Whatever legal or constitutional form the Government of
                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) takes in the near future,
                            the military and the Buddhists will almost certainly retain an effective
                            veto power.</p>
                        <p>3. The removal of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> on 27
                            January was the product of cooperation between the Buddhists (under
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>) and the military
                            (more or less under <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>).
                            This cooperation has produced at least a temporary stabilization, though
                            the balance struck is delicate and could easily be upset. There are
                            rumblings within military and Buddhist ranks and in various other
                            quarters, e.g., the Catholics, the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects, and the
                            students and other political elements in Saigon and Hue. However the
                            events of 27 January appear thus far to have had almost no disturbing
                            effect in the provinces. The course of political developments will
                            depend on what the Buddhists do and on the degree of military unity.
                            Either the Buddhists or the military or both may exploit
                            anti-Americanism as a tactical device. The explosiveness of this issue
                            will depend on how it is handled by all parties concerned, including the
                            US. Notable Viet Cong military successes could also adversely affect the
                            course of events.</p>
                        <p>4. Basic Political Determinants. South Vietnam is in the midst of a
                            social and political revolution. In the political vacuum occasioned by
                            the French departure, power was initially assumed by an elite of
                            French-educated and predominantly Catholic mandarin types, of whom
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> was both symbol
                            and archetype. Power is now passing to a much more “Vietnamese,”
                            militantly nationalistic and potentially xenophobic group of which the
                            political bonzes, the students, and certain young generals are prime
                            examples. This revolution is a formless thing, uncontrolled, and in many
                            ways genuinely spontaneous. The Communists are obviously exploiting it.
                            Nevertheless, it is something quite apart from the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-directed insurgency; indeed those who
                            aspire to lead this revolution claim that unless it is successful the
                            Communist insurgency cannot be defeated. This shift in the alignment of
                            fundamental political forces is responsible for much of the turbulence
                            we are witnessing—and will continue to witness—largely on the urban
                            scene, particularly since this process involves the striking of new
                            power balances in the midst of a war and in a situation where no
                            parliamentary traditions or institutions can effectively channel
                            political conflict.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and the “Buddhist
                            Movement.” Because of the historical context in which this revolution
                            has developed, contending factions tend to group under religious labels.
                            The issues involved, however, are ones of political power, not religious
                            doctrine. The “Buddhist movement” derives its political strength partly
                            from the political acumen and demagogic skill of its leaders, but
                            primarily from the fact that “Buddhism” has become the rallying point
                            for emotionally charged though inchoate revolutionary <pb xml:id="pg_145" n="145" facs="0177"/>aspirations. The bonzes who
                            lead this “Buddhist movement” have found the exercise of political power
                            both heady and habit forming. They do not appear to desire the
                            responsibilities of office or direct participation in government, but
                            they are determined to prevent a revival of what they consider Catholic
                            dominance and to have a veto power over major <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policies and personnel. Furthermore, as in many protest
                            movements, no contender for primacy within the Buddhist leadership feels
                            he can let a rival appear more “militant” than he.</p>
                        <p>6. Among these leaders, <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>
                            is the most influential and politically skillful. He seems to have
                            outmaneuvered all existing or potential rivals within the Buddhist
                            movement and is not likely to be deposed from within the movement
                            itself. However, were <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> to
                            leave the scene, the Buddhist movement would probably continue
                            essentially unchanged. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>
                            is vain and hyper-nationalistic; thus he probably resents the extent of
                            US involvement in Vietnamese affairs. Although he recognizes the present
                            need for US support, he regards the US as incapable of understanding the
                            political situation in South Vietnam and, over the long run, would like
                            to see the US out of the country.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>'s short-run intentions
                            are harder to divine and may not be systematically or consistently
                            developed even in his own mind. He professes to be anti-Communist and at
                            times appears to recognize that his position and the movement he leads
                            would get short shrift under a Communist regime. Nevertheless, he has
                            such a high opinion of his own political abilities that he may come to
                            feel that he can outwit the Communists and use them for his own ends;
                            indeed, he may have already reached this conclusion. The relevant
                            evidence is conflicting and precludes confident judgment. On balance we
                            incline to the view that he is probably not now deliberately working for
                            a Communist victory or Communist-dominated “neutralist” settlement.
                            Regardless of his intent, however, disruptive actions such as his thus
                            far are serving these ends.</p>
                        <p>8. The Military Establishment. Through a combination of luck and
                            political skill, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has
                            managed to retain a paramount position within the military
                            establishment, but he wears an uneasy crown. During 1964 there emerged a
                            group of officers labelled the Young Turks who saved <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> in September, but who suspect
                            his motives and who, so long as they maintain their solidarity,
                            constitute a potent threat to his position. Below the Young Turks (most
                            of whom are now one-star generals) there is another unstructured but
                            perhaps even more restless and ambitious group of colonels and
                            majors—unit commanders who during the past year have borne the brunt of
                            the fighting against the Viet Cong. Some of these officers commanded the
                            units which made possible the military pressure plays of the past
                            year.</p>
                        <p>9. By and large the military leaders are intensely nationalistic. They
                            have no intention of abandoning the war, but are impatient and
                            frustrated <pb xml:id="pg_146" n="146" facs="0178"/>over the lack of
                            progress. At the same time, however, they are divided among themselves
                            and deeply involved in politics, and some have overriding personal
                            ambitions. Many military officers do not trust <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and not a few are resentful and
                            suspicious of the Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> remains in serious danger of being
                            ousted—particularly if he should make too obvious a bid for personal
                            political power, if he appears to become overly subservient to the
                            Buddhists, or if his efforts should not soon begin to produce some
                            political stability or military progress.</p>
                        <p>10. The Communists. The military establishment and the Buddhist movement
                            have long been prime targets for Communist penetration. The present
                            military leadership seems resolutely anti-Communist even though the Viet
                            Cong have almost certainly penetrated the military establishment at
                            least enough to acquire considerable capabilities for collecting
                            intelligence. The situation in the Buddhist movement is less clear,
                            particularly since much of the Buddhists' agitation lends itself so
                            easily to Communist exploitation. There is no evidence that the movement
                            itself is Communist-directed or controlled, but there are strong
                            presumptive grounds for believing that Communist penetration is having
                            some success. The student movement seems to have been even more
                            vulnerable to Communist penetration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Present Power Relations</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>. There is conclusive evidence
                            that the dismissal of Huong on 27 January and the interim political
                            solution then announced were based on an arrangement between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>; the circumstances lead us to infer that they
                            had cooperated for some time in preparing the crisis. This cooperation
                            may have originated in the wake of the December dissolution of the High
                            National Council by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            the Young Turks, a move occasioned by pressures within the military
                            establishment but which the US strongly opposed.</p>
                        <p>12. Not long after, the Buddhists, who had intermittently engaged in
                            demonstrations against the government, renewed their campaign against
                                <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. They also emphasized
                            anti-Americanism or, more precisely, opposition to the US Ambassador for
                            his support of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>. This gave
                            the Buddhists' anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>
                            campaign an emotionally inflammatory ingredient it had hitherto lacked.
                            It is extremely unlikely that the Buddhists would have dared stress this
                            anti-US note without at least some confidence that the military would
                            not interfere. In any case, this theme proved politically beneficial,
                            and was probably personally gratifying, to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>'s
                            political position was helped by the ouster of <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, to which he was publicly
                            committed. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> obtained at
                            least temporary hold over the levers of power, and in such a manner that
                            his opponents could do little but acquiesce. All this has so clearly
                            been to the benefit of both <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> that it seems unlikely to have been fortuitous.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_147" n="147" facs="0179"/>
                        <p>13. Any alliance between <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> must be inherently
                            unstable. Each strongly distrusts the other. <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> is not likely to abide by any commitments
                            made; signs of this, in fact, are already beginning to emerge. Unless he
                            assumes the responsibilities of office, which he is unlikely to do,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>'s position as a
                            militant leader of an emotionally charged movement almost requires that
                            he continue to criticize governmental policy. On past form he is
                            unlikely to be a constructive critic, though he will probably take some
                            care not to alienate the Young Turks. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, for his part, cannot afford to alienate the
                            Buddhists—no Vietnamese politician can do this in present circumstances
                            and survive in power—but neither can he be too accommodating to them
                            without running the risk of being deposed by some of his military
                            colleagues. Most politically influential Vietnamese, civilian and
                            military, have generally acquiesced in the 27 January “solution,” though
                            there is apprehension in some quarters. Furthermore, there are
                            influential officers who were not happy with these arrangements and are
                            probably determined to prevent <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> from making a personal bid for permanent political
                            office and from giving in too far to the ever demanding Buddhists.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Near-Term Prospects</p>
                        <p>14. The present political arrangements in Saigon are avowedly temporary,
                            and there is at least a faint chance that the scenario announced for the
                            ensuing weeks may hold promise for improved political stability in South
                            Vietnam. However, in the present political context, tolerable stability
                            can only be achieved if there is a central government whose structure
                            and ranking personnel are acceptable to the majority of the important
                            military and the majority of important Buddhists—a contingency which
                            cannot at present be judged likely. Nor is it likely that a National
                            Assembly, even if convened in March, will devise a more permanent
                            structure which meets Vietnamese desires and is adapted to current
                            political power realities in South Vietnam. Yet if both these
                            contingencies were met, the spring and summer might see the evolution of
                            a stronger base for prosecuting the counterinsurgency effort than has
                            heretofore existed. The odds on such a fortunate outcome are
                            considerably less than even.</p>
                        <p>15. The course of events in the near-term future will be materially
                            influenced by the ultimate effect of the extreme nationalist sentiments
                            whipped up in recent weeks. Such sentiments, because of their xenophobic
                            and anti-US overtones, will obviously cause considerable complications
                            for the US effort. The regime is still aware of its need for US support,
                            but even in the short run we expect that nationalist sensitivities will
                            set severe limits on the degree to which the US can influence Vietnamese
                            actions. The chances have increased that nationalist sentiments, in
                            combination with war weariness and frustrations, will take a
                            pro-neutralist turn which the Communists would certainly endeavor to fan
                            and <pb xml:id="pg_148" n="148" facs="0180"/>exploit. On the other hand,
                            however, a vigorous nationalism identified with an indigenously devised
                            government reflecting local political realities will be an essential

                            we need to know on the President's press conference?<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">See <ref target="#d71fn6">footnote 6, Document

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: No, the President made
                            a general statement of our sticking to our present course and our
                            determination and also was asked what would happen if the Government
                            ever asked us to get out and he did not deal with that question, he said
                            he did not think that this was likely to happen. That was all that was
                            really substantive and I think that it came out in the evening papers as
                            his sticking to the basic line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: We should not expect
                            any impact back from that. What did he say on other subjects—what did he
                            say about visiting the Soviet Union?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: He did say that there
                            had been exchanges about his visiting the Soviet Union and the strong
                            implication was that this was a very active possibility.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: Those are the two
                            questions which I have immediately in my mind. Do you have further
                            instructions or guidance perhaps and in particular do you know what the
                            plans are for next week?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: No, we do not have
                            particular instructions for you. As to next week's plans, there is
                            nothing set up at the present time on your return. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has gone to Florida and does not
                            now plan to be back before Thursday,<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">
                                <persName>Rusk</persName> was suffering from the flu. The Thursday
                                referred to was apparently February 11.</note> but if you bring back
                            action recommendations, either he might come back or the President, of
                            course, might wish to go ahead without him so the short answer is really
                            no definite plan and if you have suggestions that will require
                            adjustments of schedules, it would be helpful if you let us know by way
                            of at least a general indication before you leave.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: We will try to make a
                            summary—I have—incidentally this is a classified line—we will try to get
                            a summary of our current thinking <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0183"/>to you tomorrow because Sunday<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">February 7.</note> we will be going back into the
                            field and we should have as much of the picture as we would like you to
                            have in outline at least by that time. My current estimate is that we
                            will not return with urgent and immediate requirements for decision
                            making meetings because of the continuing fluidity of the local
                            situation here. On the other hand we may, we will I think, wish to have
                            some development of alternatives, and I think therefore that the current
                            pattern in which the Secretary will be out of the town for two or three
                            days is an acceptable one, certainly for our purposes today. Have you
                            got all that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: I understand you
                            perfectly. We will do nothing to change our schedule unless you indicate
                            otherwise in terms of what you might propose. I of course will be on
                            hand Sunday morning—and indeed tomorrow and Saturday—to get your
                            messages. If you have some indication, well and good, otherwise we will
                            just sit tight and wait until you arrive.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: I missed your last
                            transmission, would you say again?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: I said that we will do
                            nothing to change Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            schedule unless you so indicate in your message which we presume you
                            will send tomorrow night.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: That makes good sense.
                            I would like to shift to another subject and say that our first bare
                            impression is that the confrontation which was foreshadowed as a
                            possibility in one of the Ambassador's telegrams (Saigon 2391)<note n="5" xml:id="d72fn5">
                                <ref target="#d59">Document 59</ref>.</note> is not immediately
                            likely. It appears that other local forces, military primarily, have
                            indicated strong opposition to the contingency which troubled us. There
                            is no immediate likelihood that contingency will happen. On the other
                            hand, there is no indication either as to what a resolution of the
                            present interim status will be and there is no agreed opinion that I can
                            solicit on our side as to what the preferred solution is. We hope to
                            direct attention to the development of preferences but we do not expect
                            during this business to engage in active indication of positive US
                            preferences. I would be glad of your comments on this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: I agree completely with
                            your suggestion that you take no active role while you are there. As you
                            can see from our cables we are very concerned about any appearance of an
                            active US political role in any case, and we were concerned, as you have
                            now cleared up, that the issue stated in Saigon 2391 was not likely to
                            be immediate and was somewhat more black and white than any case that we
                            would be likely to confront in the immediate future. Your evaluation of
                            the immediate situation does seem to confirm what we have been getting
                            principally from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reporting. I should
                            think we had to see how the situation settled down before <pb xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0184"/>any of us could be sure how we
                            would like to use US influence and whether we would want to take any
                            risks of having our hands show very clearly. Those are just preliminary
                            reactions but I think they accord with your thinking.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: That is exactly the way
                            we see it here. We have had a serious exchange of messages with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            <note n="6" xml:id="d72fn6">See <ref target="#d62">Documents 62</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d66">66</ref>.</note> and I think it would be
                            worth your while to have a talk with him directly and to say that I
                            mentioned this exchange to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: I understand that and I
                            will be in touch with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. The message that he sent after seeing the President
                            was seen by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and myself
                            and I have not seen your reply but I will get in touch with him in the
                            morning and will be brought abreast of that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: There is no reason to
                            view it tonight your time. Tomorrow is OK, I just wished to be sure you
                            were aware of his transmission and his view of thinking there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: Yes, we were fully
                            aware of that and I think we also saw the difficulty in producing the
                            results suggested immediately and I have not yet seen your response but
                            I will do so tomorrow morning the first thing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: In essence what I said
                            was precisely that. It was easier to make the prescriptions than get the
                            answers and in particular it was not so clear that we could have won for
                            them a working alliance that would be practical for us between the two
                            parties specified in his message, but you will be over to see my answer.
                            This conversation has been exactly what was needed for our guide. I am
                            very grateful to you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">W. Bundy</persName>: All right I have
                            nothing further at this end. If you have nothing further I guess we can
                            call it quits now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">M. Bundy</persName>: That is all I have.

                        <p>2409. Following are highlights of one and one-half hour conversation
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and I had with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> noon February 5. Also present
                            were Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CANG1">Cang</persName>, who appeared
                            to be taking detailed notes, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, Generals <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FFW1">Flott</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said he was having
                            difficulties in forming promised 20-man Military-Civil Council (<gloss target="#t_MCC1">MCC</gloss>). Explained his difficulties in getting
                            Catholics to serve, and seemed to be trying to convey impression that
                            these difficulties had no deeper roots than usual reluctance of Catholic
                            hierarchy to designate members of political or governmental bodies. Also
                            remarked that notables, of whom there were to be six, tended also to be
                            prima donnas, and would not accept permanent assignments. As a result,
                            he hopes now that each of 4 religions would sponsor one lay notable and
                            armed forces would sponsor two more, thus giving twenty members. After
                            the formation of the Council, it would choose a Chief of State (probably
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>) and approve a Prime
                            Minister and cabinet. All this he hoped to accomplish by February
                            13.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> asked
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> three main questions. After
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> had explained determination of President,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, and American people to support
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as long as necessary and in any
                            way necessary, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> asked what
                            about going North. Bundy replied that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was willing to consider appropriate means for bringing
                            pressure on North Vietnam, but this would be feasible only if it
                            involved frank and loyal partnership with a stable and reasonably
                            popular <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In discussing this,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> several times
                            referred to U.S. assistance in “liberating the North”.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> set the record straight in a very
                            deliberate manner. He explained that while it was U.S. policy to assist
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, it was not U.S. policy to
                            liberate the North. Measures would be taken against the North only
                            insofar as they support the above-stated U.S. policy objective of
                            winning the war in the South.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s second question was
                            whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would object if National
                            Council designated a military man as chief of government. Would <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> insist on a civilian chief?
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> avoided a direct answer, indicating
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be [looking 0183?] only
                            for quality and results and for indications that the person chosen
                            enjoyed sufficient popular support to stay in power for a reasonably
                            long time. <persName>Bundy</persName> reiterated, as he did on <pb xml:id="pg_154" n="154" facs="0186"/>several other occasions as
                            well, the importance USG attaches to governmental stability in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s third question was to
                            ask for an explanation of “U.S. strategy”, by which he appeared to mean
                            our policy objectives. <persName>Bundy</persName> replied appropriately,
                            emphasizing that we are here to assist <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> maintain Vietnamese independence and freedom, but that
                            we only advise and assist; main burden inevitably falls on Vietnamese,
                            who must learn to work together more cohesively and effectively.</p>
                        <p>After meeting had gone on well beyond scheduled time and as we were about
                            to leave, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> announced that
                            some twenty generals were in adjoining room and would like to meet Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>. Although this was hardly fair play
                            toward an unwarned guest, the meeting turned out to be a good thing,
                            allowing <persName>Bundy</persName> on invitation from <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to make a few graceful remarks
                            to the generals. <persName>Bundy</persName> emphasized President's
                            determination to continue to assist Vietnam and his full support for his
                            representatives out here. In praising Vietnamese armed forces and
                            generals present, <persName>Bundy</persName> avoided any reference to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>

                            Discussions here still continuing this evening. We have made
                            considerable progress in discussions of dependent problem and
                            contingency planning but have agreed that mission should present its
                            views in separate telegrams so as to avoid joint recommendations as
                            inappropriate for both Ambassador and me. Accordingly we now plan to
                            prepare our own analytical report en route home rather than to send
                            detailed comments now. Tomorrow will be spent in the field and should
                            give additional color to conclusions which will contain few major
                            surprises. Overall impression is that important decisions are necessary
                            but that there is time in which to make them.</p>

                            attack by the Viet Cong on the U.S. Army barracks at Pleiku in South
                            Vietnam and other attacks on two South Vietnamese airfields. A
                            recommendation was made that U.S. planes attack three targets in North
                            Vietnam and the South Vietnamese, with U.S. air cover, attack a fourth
                                target.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">See <ref target="#d78fn3">footnotes 3 and 4, Document 78</ref>.</note> There was

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The attack on
                            Pleiku came as a surprise. There were no South Vietnamese casualties.
                            Our forces were in a compound outside the town. The area has been quiet
                            recently. At one time it was General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s headquarters and formerly was pacified.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: However, the
                            Viet Cong had recently been building up in this area.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We are all
                            in accord that action must be taken. We need to decide how we shall
                            handle the air strikes publicly. The Soviets may call for a conference.
                            We must make clear that the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong are the
                            same. We retaliate against North Vietnam because Hanoi directs the Viet
                            Cong, supplies arms, and infiltrates men. We need to answer the question
                            as to why we are striking North Vietnam when the Americans were attacked
                            by Viet Cong in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>:
                            Arrangements should be made for a joint U.S.-South Vietnamese
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Should U.S.
                            dependents in South Vietnam be withdrawn at once or only later at a time
                            when the North Vietnamese may be responding to our air attacks?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Get them out
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>: Should the
                            U.S. dependents be evacuated so quickly that it appears we are running
                            away?</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>The President: We cannot contemplate the loss of U.S. women and children
                            in an attack by the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong in Saigon or
                            elsewhere. We have long sought to get out the dependents and have been
                            waiting only for the proper atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>In summary, we have decided to make the air strikes. Our strikes should
                            be arranged so as to hit in daylight hours. We need a recommendation
                            from Saigon. One hundred and twenty U.S. planes would attack three
                            barracks in the south of North Vietnam and a fourth target would be hit
                            by South Vietnamese planes. A final decision is needed within the
                            hour.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>: The four
                            targets to be struck are those discussed earlier.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: A total of 132
                            U.S. planes will be involved, plus 22 South Vietnamese planes for a
                            total of 154. Estimates are that we will lose no planes and the South
                            Vietnamese will lose two planes.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of several issues including the need for U.S.
                            reinforcements following the air strikes, and whether a Congressional
                            resolution was needed to insure the legal position of the
                            Administration. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s position was that the quicker we have a
                            resolution, the better.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>: The North
                            Vietnamese attack has opened many eyes. We are not now in a penny ante
                            game. It appears that the local populace in South Vietnam is not behind
                            us, else the Viet Cong could not have carried out their surprise
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>The President said the group would meet again at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow to
                            decide what additional forces should be moved into South Vietnam. The
                            strike on the four targets was authorized and the request was made that
                            commercial transports be used to fly out dependents. (Location of
                            targets to be struck is marked on the attached map and target
                                list.)<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">Attached, but not printed.</note>

                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> reported to the
                            President a telephone conversation<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">See <ref target="#d78">Document 78</ref>.</note> with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> which relayed the
                            unanimous recommendation of the Country Team to authorize joint
                            U.S./Vietnamese strikes at four targets in North Vietnam. There was some
                            discussion of the number of aircraft involved, the fact that very slight
                            resistance was expected and the need for a rapid decision in order to
                            permit the strikes to take place during the remaining hours of daylight
                            in Vietnam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            pointed out that all the targets are in southern North Vietnam and all
                            are directly related to North Vietnamese infiltration into South
                            Vietnam. He pointed out also that the targets were deliberately selected
                            to avoid the necessity of a large operation to take out the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> defensive forces in the North in order
                            to permit a strike.</p>
                        <p>2. The President's first question was whether the U.S. efforts would be
                            apt to alert the enemy which then could take advantage of the follow-on
                            by the Vietnamese, as the latter were expected to be slower in getting
                            off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed his
                            doubt of this and his belief in the great importance that the Vietnamese
                            actually do participate. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that the matter had been cleared in
                            general with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hitherto and would
                            be in response to a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> request on this
                            occasion. Asked who the “<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>” would be,
                            he replied General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. The President then questioned how the Viet Cong had been able to
                            launch the attack on Pleiku and whether there was a failure of local <pb xml:id="pg_159" n="159" facs="0191"/>security. This was discussed
                            generally, it being pointed out that infiltration even into the Pleiku
                            area is not too difficult.</p>
                        <p>4. The President then asked the estimated effect of the proposed air
                            strike. The reply emphasized that the objectives were mostly military,
                            the main effect would occur in the Dong Hoi attack and that the
                            estimated casualty rates ran in the neighborhood of 4,000 military with
                            few civilians.</p>
                        <p>5. The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s views. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that all agreed that a retaliatory
                            strike was necessary and he suggested that the targets chosen were
                            appropriate. He said that the main problem would be how to handle the
                            publicity and the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            connection. He emphasized the necessity of relating the Pleiku attack
                            and the infiltration directly to Hanoi, and to permit <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> the belief that he had been
                            mouse-trapped by the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>6. The President then requested consideration of the dependents question.
                            He was informed that the dependents could be gotten out in 48 to 72
                            hours. This met general approval and the Speaker commented that the
                            removal of dependents at this time would indicate the firmness of our
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>7. The President then went around the room asking each person if he
                            concurred. All but one did so, especially Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> who emphasized the necessity of
                            establishing an adequate and prompt response to the Pleiku attack.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName> pointed out that
                            the U.S. stood down the DeSoto Patrol and U-2 flights in deference to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit, but the
                            enemy did not provide any similar recognition of Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s visit. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> indicated his belief that the
                            Soviets would protest and denounce and might call for a conference but
                            that inaction would be worse. No exceptional enemy reactions were
                            anticipated from either the Chinese or the North Vietnamese, although
                            the Viet Cong was expected to step up its efforts, according to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>.</p>
                        <p>8. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> protested the
                            decision, indicating that he thought that caution should be our
                            watchword. He pointed out the lack of a solid government in Vietnam and
                            indeed wondered what government we had cleared this operation with. He
                            further suggested that the dependents should be gotten out before any
                            actions were taken. He particularly emphasized that the implications and
                            possible developments from this step be carefully analyzed, including
                            the possibility of engaging in a large-scale conflict with China, the
                            position the Soviet Union would take, probably assisting the healing of
                            the Soviet-Sino split, and in summary believed that the results could be
                            worse than Korea.</p>
                        <p>9. The President took the opposite opinion, emphasizing that he had kept
                            the shotgun over the mantel and the bullets in the basement for a long
                            time now, but that the enemy was killing his personnel and he could not
                            expect them to continue their work if he did not authorize them <pb xml:id="pg_160" n="160" facs="0192"/>to take steps to defend
                            themselves. He commented that “cowardice has gotten us into more wars
                            than response has.” He particularly recalled the fact that we would not
                            have gotten into World War I if we had been courageous in the early
                            stages, nor World War II. He then said he realized that there was a risk
                            of involving the Soviets and Chinese but that neither of these are
                            friendly with us and the problem is to face up to them both.</p>
                        <p>10. The President then decided to authorize the strikes, move the
                            dependents and to meet again to consider further steps at 8:00 a.m. The
                            execute order would be conditioned on the Vietnamese government's
                            approval. For the dependents, the President directed that the Defense
                            Department provide such additional military transport as would be
                            necessary in order to move them rapidly.</p>

                        <p rend="center">6 February</p>
                        <p>At 1505 I received a call from the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss>
                            giving initial reports of Viet Cong attacks on two compounds in the
                            vicinity of Pleiku Airfield, on the airfield at Tuy Hoa and two villages
                            in the immediate vicinity, and on a village some 15 miles north of Nha
                            Trang. First reports dealt principally with the Pleiku area and
                            indicated that there might be substantial U.S. casualties, both killed
                            and wounded, and damage to U.S. aircraft. I reported the foregoing at
                            1509 in turn to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the President. I then called Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> but failed to reach him.
                            I then called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> at
                            about 1515 to report this information and asked him to call Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in Saigon and to
                            request <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s
                            recommendations as to reprisal actions we should undertake. At 1520 I
                            departed for the White House.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_161" n="161" facs="0193"/>
                        <p>At the White House, I attended a meeting on Arms for Jordan. That meeting
                            adjourned at 1700 and I then gave to the President the latest Vietnamese
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me what actions I thought would be recommended and I
                            told him that I thought Option 1 would be recommended. I then discussed
                            the targets included in Option 1. The President then asked me, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, and Mr. Bill Bundy if we would
                            agree with such recommendation. Each of us responded affirmatively. The
                            President then inquired whether we had sent a message to Saigon
                            requesting the views of the officials there. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> indicated that such a message had been
                            sent an hour ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">Not found.</note> The
                            meeting closed with the President asking that we let him know when the
                            Saigon recommendations were received.</p>
                        <p>At 1830, I returned to the Pentagon and joined General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>. There, we discussed the
                            forces to be alerted, the number of persons to be evacuated, and the
                            possible assets to be used for the evacuation. Additionally, we
                            discussed the targets to be struck if Option 1 were recommended, and
                            those to be struck if both Options 1 and 2 were recommended. I asked for
                            a list of the forces available for use in the strikes and a list of
                            those forces to be alerted—both to be used later in discussion with the
                            President. During this discussion, General Blanchard and Admiral Mustin
                            joined us.</p>
                        <p>At this time, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            called to say that he felt it desirable to call Saigon on the KY-9
                            secure phone and obtain Saigon's recommendations. I then called
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> but could not
                            reach him and talked instead to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis
                                Johnson</persName> on a normal telephone in his home. Using double
                            talk, I asked if Washington's cable had been received and found that it
                            had been. I told <persName>Johnson</persName> that it was urgent that we
                            receive Saigon's recommendations as soon as possible and asked when this
                            might be. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that this would be
                            within 30 minutes or so and also said that we could probably guess what
                            their recommendations would be. In closing, I stressed again the urgency
                            of early receipt of the recommendations, asking that they be given over
                            a secure telephone.</p>
                        <p>I reported the foregoing telephone conversation to both the President and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. The President was
                            pleased and asked when we could expect to hear from Saigon. I estimated
                            that it would be within one and one half hours. At this point the
                            President noted the need to evacuate dependents and asked me what our
                            capability was to do so. I responded that this was being checked now.
                            The President also emphasized that we should alert the strike forces and
                            I told him General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> had
                            done so at 1800. Finally, the President asked about alerting other
                            forces. To this, I <pb xml:id="pg_162" n="162" facs="0194"/>responded
                            that we were working on the problem now and that I would call him again
                            when I heard from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>At 1905 I received a call from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> in Saigon over an open telephone. He said that all
                            in Saigon unanimously recommend a) that action be taken today; b) that
                            targets 33, 36 and 39<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">The Dong Hoi Barracks,
                                the Vit Thu Lu Barracks, and the Chap Le Army Barracks,
                                respectively.</note> should be hit by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>'s forces; c) that target
                                32<note n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">The Vu Con Barracks.</note> should be
                            undertaken in a joint effort by local forces; and d) that an
                            announcement concerning the removal of dependents could be made
                            immediately after any action. [Omission in the source text.] for
                            recommendations as to the time-frame for evacuation of dependents,
                            pointing out that the President felt strongly about it. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that the evacuation should be
                            done promptly but in an orderly fashion. <persName>Bundy</persName> also
                            stressed the need for prompt decision by the highest authority on their
                            recommendations because of the problems associated with the joint effort
                            on target 32.</p>
                        <p>I immediately called the President, told him that we had received
                            Saigon's recommendations, and asked when he wished to meet again. The
                            President suggested that we meet at 1945 and asked who should be there
                            beyond the group that had met in the afternoon, plus the Secretary of
                            Defense and the Vice President. I suggested that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should be represented and the President
                            asked me to call General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName>. At this point I called Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, told him of the meeting, and
                            said that my car would pick him up at his home. I asked a member of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s staff to
                            notify General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, I received a second call from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, this time over a secure telephone.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> said that they wished to make a joint
                            announcement in Saigon after the strike prior to any announcement in
                            Washington and reiterated the great importance of joint participation in
                            the proposed strike action. I noted that this posed timing problems and
                            read to him a proposed cable to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that the cable as
                            drafted put them in a time bind and asked if it were a decision by the
                            highest authority to proceed as specified in our draft cable. I replied
                            negatively but said that General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I would so recommend to the highest
                            authority. <persName>Bundy</persName> stressed again the need for a
                            rapid decision. I expressed the hope that I could call a decision to him
                            by 2015 and assured him I would call him as soon as a decision was
                            reached. At 1920, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I left again for the White House.</p>
                        <p>The National Security Council convened at 1935. Those present included
                            the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>, Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, Speaker <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">McCormack</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Llewellyn Thompson</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, <pb xml:id="pg_163" n="163" facs="0195"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Carl Rowan</persName>, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RG1">Reedy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Bromley
                                Smith</persName> and myself.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the meeting, I reported on the <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> conversation and the
                            recommendations made by Saigon. The President then asked me to describe
                            the targets proposed to be struck, the North Vietnamese forces at these
                            targets, and to estimate North Vietnamese casualties both military and
                            civilian. In turn, he asked General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> to explain the details of the proposed operation
                            and to give his views of anticipated North Vietnamese responses. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I responded to
                            these questions. The President then queried Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> as to his views on the recommended
                            course of action and the difficulties involved. Subsequently, he asked
                            for the views of everyone around the table as to the desirability of
                            proceeding with the recommended course of action.</p>
                        <p>After full discussion, the President, on the recommendation of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, authorized the execution of the
                            proposed course of action provided that Vietnamese clearance was
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>I then left the meeting to communicate this decision to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> in Saigon. I further
                            told Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> that the decision had been made to
                            evacuate all dependents from Vietnam as rapidly as possible following
                            the strike, and that there could be no reclama of this decision.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> said that we already had military
                            clearance; political clearance would be had shortly. I indicated that we
                            would await word of political clearance and stressed the need to have it
                            as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>After this conversation I returned to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting where a proposed press release for issuance
                            Sunday morning was being discussed. It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> would reconvene at 0800, 7 February, to
                            discuss actions to be taken on Sunday and the issuance of a public
                            release.</p>
                        <p>Soon thereafter I received a call from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> saying that political clearance had been
                            obtained. I relayed this to General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and directed him to issue the order of
                            execution, which he did. I also reported these actions to the President
                            and those others still present in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting. We then reworked the proposed press release to
                            be issued after the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on
                            Sunday morning as well as a release to be issued on the evacuation of
                            dependents. General Wheeler and I then left the White House to return to
                            the Pentagon.</p>
                        <p>At the Pentagon I then cleared a proposed cable with respect to the
                            alerting of additional forces for possible movement.<note n="5" xml:id="d78fn5">Not further identified.</note> I also authorized the
                            use of ten additional aircraft for the strike on target 33. And,
                            finally, I authorized the removal of Farm Gate markings from U.S.-manned
                            aircraft <pb xml:id="pg_164" n="164" facs="0196"/>for the strike on
                            target 32 if this could be done without delaying the strike.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I then talked
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> on the telephone.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked that we
                            delay the time over target for targets 33, 36, and 39 by one hour,
                            making the new <gloss target="#t_TOT1">TOT</gloss> 1600 Vietnam time.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I approved
                            this change dependent upon Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>'s agreement. Thereafter, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> said that it was infeasible to
                            make this change and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed to the original time over target of 1500
                            H.</p>
                        <p>At 2330 I met with General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDA1">Burchinal</persName>, his staff, Mr. Lennartson and Colonel Smith.
                            At this time I indicated the nature and content of the charts and maps
                            which would be required for a background press conference on Sunday
                            morning and discussed the necessary back-up materials. I then met with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDA1">Burchinal</persName> to review the
                            status of our preparations, in particular a requirement for military
                            aircraft for the evacuation of dependents. At this time I authorized
                            General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDA1">Burchinal</persName> to move
                                <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> aircraft as far as Clark Field
                            to be in position to expedite a dependent evacuation. I also asked
                            General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDA1">Burchinal</persName> to prepare
                            another list of additional forces which might be required should the
                            North Vietnamese and/or the ChiComs take escalatory action.</p>
                        <p>We also discussed the possible ChiCom reactions and the ability of the
                            U.S. to move ground forces into the area if the ChiComs moved on the
                            ground. General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDA1">Burchinal</persName> said
                            that he was satisfied that our plans were in good shape and that we
                            could respond promptly.</p>
                        <p rend="center">7 February</p>
                        <p>At 0105, I received the first report of aircraft airborne on their
                            mission—eight A1H planes had departed the Ranger on the way to target 36
                            with a predicted time over target of 0700Z (0200 Washington time).<note n="6" xml:id="d78fn6">The President's Daily Diary indicates that he

                        <p>1. Following are the points I wanted to make on telephone but could not
                            because no secure line available. They relate to theory of a graduated
                            reprisal program which was discussed at length here by
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> group with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. This message is not
                            intended as official transmission of any consensus, but is intended to
                            flag a few points which may affect the characterization, by statements
                            to the press, of the reprisal action now in process, and of our future
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>2. The concept would be that of a graduated reprisal program which,
                            through a measured, controlled sequence of actions against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, brought sufficient pressure to bear on
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to persuade it to stop its
                            intervention in the South. An analysis, rationale and illustrative
                            scenario for this program had been put in draft<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">Apparently a reference to <persName corresp="#p_MML1">Manfull</persName>'s draft memorandum dated
                                February 6, “A Graduated Reprisal Program to Stop <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Intervention in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.” (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Vietnam, Vol. XXVII)</note> here
                            yesterday, before the Pleiku incident.</p>
                        <p>3. Our thought now is that the first action (today's) would be a clear
                            cut reprisal for a specific atrocity, but that hereafter reprisal
                            actions would become less and less related to specific <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> spectaculars and more and more related to
                            a catalogue of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> outrages in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> say in a prior several-day period of
                            time. Presumably outrages such as assassinations, railroad destruction,
                            and so on would, as the reprisal program progresses, no longer be
                            privileged <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> acts. They would be scooped
                            up in the general statement of provocations which justified the
                            then-current military action against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. All along, care would be taken to make clear that
                            there is no objective to destroy or conquer the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. For the plan to work best, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            should participate prominently in the reprisals and in the public
                            announcements. There is a feeling that the announcements in each case
                            should be made here in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>5. Not much of a government is required for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to play its role. The present government, for example,
                            ineffectual as it is, is enough to participate in such a program of
                            graduated reprisals. It is not good enough to carry out the pacification
                            program, but that is another question.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_166" n="166" facs="0198"/>
                        <p>6. The reprisal program thus gives something like a Phase II, but
                            provides a much better international and internal-US posture. It also
                            reduces pressure for negotiations. Feeling is that US should be very
                            much in background when and if negotiations begin to make sense—that, if
                            there is an adequate government in South Vietnam at that time, any talks
                            should be between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, probably at a military level.</p>
                        <p>7. Related to all this is the judgment that the fabric of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is pulling apart, that things are going
                            badly in the field as well as in Saigon, and just about only question is
                            how long it will take for the situation to disintegrate. The judgment is
                            that a regular program will probably dampen <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities in due course and will probably inspire the
                            South Vietnamese to more effective efforts. The belief is widespread
                            among the South Vietnamese that the US is on the verge of bugging
                            out.</p>
                        <p>8. Relevance of all of the above is that statements made Sunday and
                                Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">February 7 and 8.</note> will
                            differ depending on whether Pleiku reprisal is thought of as a
                            single-shot affair like Gulf of Tonkin or whether it is thought of as
                            the start of reprisal-oriented squeeze. <persName>Bundy</persName> who
                            has not seen this message, thought you would want to have this informal
                            thinking in hand Sunday, since we are not due to arrive Andrews until
                            late Sunday night. He will report his views on arrival. You can expect a

                        <p>There was a discussion of the statement to be issued from the White House
                            announcing the reprisal air strikes in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_167" n="167" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>: Why cannot we
                            handle this matter through the United Nations? Can't the Geneva powers
                            act?</p>
                        <p>The President: This cannot be done.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The surprise
                            attack on our base at Pleiku resulted in 7 U.S. deaths and 109 wounded.
                            Numerous U.S. planes were damaged.</p>
                        <p>In reprisal, four army barracks in North Vietnam were attacked. Three of
                            the four targets were weathered in. Either the attack planes did not
                            take off or they went to the target but could not see enough to drop
                            their bombs. A total of 33 attack aircraft were involved, plus 8 planes
                            providing aircap and 8 planes engaged in flak suppression.</p>
                        <p>As to our next move, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommends we attack the three targets not hit
                            because of weather.<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">This recommendation was
                                made by <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in telegram
                                2419 from Saigon, 3 p.m. Saigon time February 7, and received at the
                                Department of State at 2:08 a.m. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> Notwithstanding his
                            recommendation, no U.S. planes should take part in a second attack. A
                            South Vietnamese attack on their target is acceptable. We would provide
                            an aircap of 4 to 8 planes plus 4 to 8 flak suppression planes to assist
                            the South Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: The reprisal
                            by the South Vietnamese would be for the Viet Cong attack on a South
                            Vietnam village. This is a different situation from the strikes
                            authorized yesterday. We need to avoid appearing to respond only when
                            Americans are attacked.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is right in
                            recommending that we should not hit today the three targets not hit
                            yesterday. If we do so, the Communists will get a wrong signal and think
                            that we are launching an offensive. Our officials in Saigon want a
                            graduated response to the entire North Vietnamese military effort rather
                            than merely retaliatory strikes to attacks by the North Vietnamese and
                            the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The Chiefs
                            believe that ground action against the North Vietnamese effort is
                            adequate to reverse the situation. Air strikes on the three targets are
                            not necessary from a military point of view. However, a South Vietnamese
                            attack on their target is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>: We have
                            completed our reprisal action for the North Vietnamese surprise attack.
                            Another attack cannot be called reprisal. The punishment should fit the
                            crime. No additional air strikes should be made now.</p>
                        <p>(The statement to be issued by the White House was approved and given to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RG1">George Reedy</persName> for release to
                            the press.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">For text, see Department of State

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>: If we encourage
                            an air strike by the South Vietnamese, everyone will think it is a U.S.
                            attack. Therefore, we should send along U.S. planes to ensure that the
                            South Vietnamese strike is successful.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Why should we
                            only hit one out of four targets? If the plan to strike four was good,
                            why should we not complete it?</p>
                        <p>Several Council members explained the nature of the decision to make a
                            reprisal strike only.</p>
                        <p>The President: We need to know the extent of the damage caused by
                            yesterday's strike. This will have a bearing on future decisions. We
                            should give consideration to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s recommendation but for the time being, we
                            should approve a strike by the South Vietnamese only. Bomb damage
                            assessment flights by U.S. planes should be flown.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, turning to
                            the question of withdrawing dependents, circulated a text of a White
                            House release covering the subject. It would announce the immediate
                            withdrawal of dependents or their withdrawal in a two-week period, as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> prefers.</p>
                        <p>The President: For 15 months we have been trying to bring about the
                            withdrawal of dependents. Thus, a decision to do so within 15 days is
                            acceptable. The number of days in which they will be withdrawn can be
                            worked out so long as it is absolutely certain that the dependents are
                            coming out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Hawk
                            Battalion will go ashore at Danang today. Some planes which were
                            diverted and went on to Saigon can be used for withdrawing dependents.
                            As many as 400 or 500 can be removed on these planes.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do we think that Saigon is going to be a target? If so,
                            why should we make any announcement about the withdrawal of dependents?
                            We should hold the announcement until we have talked to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> by phone. The word
                            “orderly” should be taken out of the announcement.</p>

                        <p>1. The first part of the meeting was devoted to editing the White House
                                release<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">For text, see Department of State
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 22, 1965, pp. 238–239.</note> on the evening's
                            developments. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had
                            recommended that the reference to the Tonkin incident be taken out as it
                            was only a one-time activity. State agreed with this position. It was
                            decided, however, to leave the reference in a modified form.</p>
                        <p>2. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> suggested that
                            the release give particular emphasis to the President's resolution to
                            avoid any wider war and that it indicate that we are prepared to bring
                            this incident to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or to a
                            reconvened Geneva Conference. The President said that his advisors had
                            told him that it was hopeless to expect anything out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> confirmed from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. With respect to the Geneva
                            Conference, the President said that he would be prepared to consider
                            this somewhat later but not at this moment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized that any Geneva
                            Conference should only be entered from a position of greater strength
                            than we now have.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then gave a
                            review of the situation. He brought out that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had recommended that all
                            additional targets not hit on the first run be undertaken on the second
                            day. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> were of the
                            opinion that additional U.S. strikes would not be appropriate but that a
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strike with U.S. support was
                            not only appropriate but quite essential, in order to demonstrate full
                            Vietnamese participation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> based their recommendation on the desirability that
                            Hanoi and Moscow not be <pb xml:id="pg_170" n="170" facs="0202"/>led to
                            believe that the U.S. had begun a full-blown offensive effort. They
                            recommended that this be a matter of separate consideration and decision
                            and not to be the result of bad weather. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> reported that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will probably recommend such a
                            steady increase in pressures but he also agreed that this should be
                            considered separately perhaps after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s return. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believes that increased military
                            pressures are needed but that these are not needed immediately and he
                            agreed with the recommendation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that another American strike could
                            be construed as an American campaign whereas a <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strike would be comparatively easy to explain. The
                            latter also left <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> some
                            leeway. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> asked
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would not consult
                            with Peking on his way back to Moscow. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that he might consult but
                            that the leadership of the Soviet Union today is so much a collegial
                            affair that no decision could be arrived at before <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> returned to Moscow to
                            consult.</p>
                        <p>4. It was brought out that the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>
                            alone might not do much but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said they definitely should try. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName> wondered at the possible bad
                            effects of a <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> failure. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that they
                            should be able to accomplish something, especially with full American
                            assistance in navigation, flak suppression, etc. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> agreed with the current action
                            as did the Speaker. The President said that he would agree with this
                            step but wait for Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s return before making
                            any decisions as to further courses of action.</p>
                        <p>5. Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> stated that
                            he found it difficult to understand why a plan that was considered
                            appropriate last night was now stopped when only halfway completed. The
                            President pointed out that the decision was to make a “prompt and
                            adequate” response, that no one other than those present knew how many
                            targets were contemplated and that the one target hit was by far the
                            biggest and had the most potential for damage. He also said that he
                            wished to have a chance to review the matter with Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> on his return before making any decisions
                            as to going further than the present. He added that a prompt, adequate
                            and joint (with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) reply was what
                            was sought. Representative Ford indicated that he would prefer the
                            original plan and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s recommendation. (Comment: Representative
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>'s raising this was
                            partly caused by his reading a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                                summary<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            that preliminary post-strike reporting indicated that “at least some
                            damage” was done. The President picked this up and asked whether <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had any separate reports, which General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName> indicated was not
                            the case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <pb xml:id="pg_171" n="171" facs="0203"/>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> indicated that the reporting
                            did indicate very substantial damage to the target area.)</p>
                        <p>6. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> stated that he
                            believed that the purpose of the operation was to impress <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_GIAP1">Giap</persName> and so forth. He therefore agreed
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> that it was
                            necessary that Vietnamese participate in the operation, but that it was
                            not necessary to go any further at this time. The President commented
                            that he also intended to impress <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and a number of others in the world, including
                            our own citizens.</p>
                        <p>7. The President then emphasized the necessity that the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strike's success be assured by the
                            fullest possible support from the American side. He also directed that
                            an extensive effort be made to determine the extent of the damage done
                            in the first strike. He said that he would consider General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s recommendation but that he
                            would await Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s return before any
                            additional steps.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to dependents, it was pointed out that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> preferred a 15 to 30
                            day evacuation on a deliberate scale in order not to create any feeling
                            of panic. The President indicated considerable impatience with this
                            saying that this 15 day type of operation had been going on for 15
                            months and he wished it to move. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that he preferred a rapid evacuation
                            and wondered whether the President would accept a one or two week
                            period. The President stated that he did not wish to have the number of
                            days precisely fixed but he wished to push Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to all deliberate speed, to
                            provide him with all facilities, etc. However, he preferred that the
                            matter not be exposed to public discussion until an agreement with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> could be
                            obtained. He therefore directed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to consult with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> on the phone in order to seek
                            some agreement. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                            commented that it might be good to scare some of the Saigonese who have
                            participated too little in this war to date.</p>
                        <p>9. The President then went around the room asking for any additional
                            comments. With respect to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, he asked
                            whether it had any reports he should be made aware of or whether it had
                            any suspicions as to what may happen. He commented that he did not wish
                            to be told later that we had suspected something. General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName> said that all our reporting
                            had been made available and that we had no reservations.</p>
                        <p>10. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> then
                            commented that he anticipated the possibility of an action by the
                            Communists in Laos, and by the Chinese to strengthen the defenses of
                            North Vietnam. He believed that the result would be more apt to divide
                            China from the Soviets than to put them together. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> anticipated additional Viet
                            Cong pressure in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_172" n="172" facs="0204"/>
                        <p>11. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> said he had
                            spoken frankly in response to the President's invitation but wished to
                            assure him, now the decision was made, that he would work to support
                            him.</p>
                        <p>12. The President made clear his insistence that all avoid comment on the
                            meeting and refer questions to the State and Defense Departments.</p>

                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I had asked him to come by my house in order
                            that I might discuss with him the events that had taken place in
                            Viet-Nam over the week-end. As he knew, a sneak attack had been made on
                            American personnel in an American compound and at an airfield as well as
                            other attacks in South Viet-Nam. I told him that a destroyer patrol in
                            the Gulf of Tonkin had been scheduled but that we had cancelled it when
                            we had learned of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            visit to Hanoi in order not to embarrass him or cause any
                            misunderstanding. I said we had also asked the South Vietnamese to
                            suspend some actions which might have been misinterpreted. As he knew,
                            the President had sent <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> to Saigon and the other side had made this attack
                            on our personnel which had killed seven and wounded a very large number.
                            These were not the first attacks of this kind, but in the circumstances
                            in which these took place, and by their nature, we believe that our
                            failure to act would have <pb xml:id="pg_173" n="173" facs="0205"/>been
                            misunderstood. We believed in fact that this was a deliberate attempt on
                            the part of Hanoi to, as we would put it, “mouse trap” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. We believed they thought their
                            action would enable Hanoi and Peiping to say that they had demonstrated
                            that the United States was a paper tiger.</p>
                        <p>I said that as he knew, the President had suggested an exchange of visits
                            with the Soviet leaders in order to try to resolve our problems. The
                            President was very sincere in this and our policy with respect to
                            Southeast Asia remained as it had been, namely, that if the North
                            Vietnamese aggression in this area was ended and if North Viet-Nam would
                            respect the integrity of its neighbors, we would be delighted to
                            withdraw our forces from that area.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if I had
                            been authorized by the President to make these remarks and I replied
                            that I was acting under his instructions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the
                            President would be making a statement to the nation or holding a press
                            conference about the matter and I said that a report on what had
                            happened would be made by the Pentagon, but I did not think that the
                            President intended to hold a special press conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would, of
                            course, inform his government of my remarks. He said that our action in
                            hitting another state was different from a guerrilla action and he
                            thought that his government would consider our action as a deliberate
                            provocation. I pointed out that it was not we that had taken the first
                            action and on the contrary we had taken steps to avoid this development.
                            All we are asking is for the carrying out of the Geneva Accords.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">On February 9 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, on instructions from his government, made

                        <p>“We were to have spent Sunday on a series of field expeditions in the
                            neighborhood of Saigon examining various aspects of the fortification
                            program but Sunday morning began for us as Sunday noon began here with
                            the news of the attacks centering on Pleiku but not limited to Pleiku
                            and we joined in the process of making sure that the views and opinions
                            and attitudes of the country team were adequately and clearly reported
                            to Washington while the President and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> were viewing the situation and making their immediate
                            decisions. At the time I decided it would be more useful for us to get
                            back here as rapidly as possible. We rescheduled the aircraft as early
                            as it could be managed to bring it in from Clark Field. We cancelled the
                            planned stop-over in Honolulu, came home the straight route. There was,
                            however, time available before that return could be organized for
                            General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> and for me

                        <p>The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating, and without new U.S. action
                            defeat appears inevitable—probably not in a matter of weeks or perhaps
                            even months, but within the next year or so. There is still time to turn
                            it around, but not much.</p>
                        <p>The stakes in Vietnam are extremely high. The American investment is very
                            large, and American responsibility is a fact of life which is palpable
                            in the atmosphere of Asia, and even elsewhere. The international
                            prestige of the United States, and a substantial part of our influence,
                            are directly at risk in Vietnam. There is no way of unloading the burden
                            on the Vietnamese themselves, and there is no way of negotiating
                            ourselves out of Vietnam which offers any serious promise at present. It
                            is possible that at some future time a neutral non-Communist force may
                            emerge, perhaps under Buddhist leadership, but no such force currently
                            exists, and any negotiated U.S. withdrawal today would mean surrender on
                            the installment plan.</p>
                        <p>The policy of graduated and continuing reprisal outlined in Annex A is
                            the most promising course available, in my judgment. That judgment is
                            shared by all who accompanied me from Washington, and I think by all
                            members of the country team.</p>
                        <p>The events of the last twenty-four hours have produced a practicable
                            point of departure for this policy of reprisal, and for the removal of
                            U.S. dependents. They may also have catalyzed the formation of a new
                            Vietnamese government. If so, the situation may be at a turning
                            point.</p>
                        <p>There is much that can and should be done to support and to supplement
                            our present effort, while adding sustained reprisals. But I want to
                            stress one important general conclusion which again is shared by all
                            members of my party: the U.S. mission is composed of outstanding men,
                            and U.S. policy within Vietnam is mainly right and well directed. None
                            of the special solutions or criticisms put forward with zeal by
                            individual reformers in government or in the press is of major
                            importance, and many of them are flatly wrong. No man is perfect, and
                            not every tactical step of recent months has been perfectly chosen, but
                            when you described the Americans in Vietnam as your first team, you were
                            right.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The General Situation</p>
                        <p>For the last year—and perhaps for longer—the overall situation in Vietnam
                            has been deteriorating. The Communists have been gaining and the
                            anti-Communist forces have been losing. As a result there is now great
                            uncertainty among Vietnamese as well as Americans as to whether
                            Communist victory can be prevented. There is nervousness about the
                            determination of the U.S. Government. There is recrimination and fear
                            among Vietnamese political leaders. There is an appearance of wariness
                            among some military leaders. There is a worrisome lassitude among the
                                <pb xml:id="pg_176" n="176" facs="0208"/>Vietnamese generally. There
                            is a distressing absence of positive commitment to any serious social or
                            political purpose. Outside observers are ready to write the patient off.
                            All of this tends to bring latent anti-Americanism dangerously near to
                            the surface.</p>
                        <p>To be an American in Saigon today is to have a gnawing feeling that time
                            is against us. Junior officers in all services are able, zealous and
                            effective within the limits of their means. Their morale is sustained by
                            the fact that they know that they are doing their jobs well and that
                            they will not have to accept the responsibility for defeat. But near the
                            top, where responsibility is heavy and accountability real, one can
                            sense the inner doubts of men whose outward behavior remains
                            determined.</p>
                        <p>The situation is not all black. The overall military effectiveness of the
                            Vietnamese armed forces in open combat continues to grow. The month of
                            January was one of outstanding and genuine success in offensive military
                            action, showing the highest gross count of Viet Cong dead of any month
                            of the war, and a very high ratio also of enemy to friendly losses. We
                            believe that General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is right (and General Alsop wrong) when he
                            says that the Viet Cong do not now plan to expose themselves to
                            large-scale military engagements in which their losses on the average
                            would be high and their gains low. (The operation at Binh Gia<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d14fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    14</ref>.</note> is analyzed as a special case, representing the
                            taking of a friendly Catholic village as bait rather than a decision to
                            force pitched battle—more such cases are expected and the particular
                            military problem posed is difficult.)</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Vietnamese people, although war weary, are also remarkably
                            tough and resilient, and they do not find the prospect of Communist
                            domination attractive. Their readiness to quit is much lower than the
                            discouraging events of recent months might lead one to expect. It is
                            probable that most Vietnamese think American withdrawal is more likely
                            than an early switch to neutralism or surrender by major elements within
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the social and political fabric is stretched thin, and
                            extremely unpleasant surprises are increasingly possible—both political
                            and military.</p>
                        <p>And it remains a stubborn fact that the percentage of the countryside
                            which is dominated or threatened by the Viet Cong continues to grow.
                            Even in areas which are “cleared,” the follow-on pacification is stalled
                            because of widespread belief that the Viet Cong are going to win in the
                            long run. The areas which can be regarded as truly cleared and pacified
                            and safe are few and shrinking. (An important exception to this is the
                            area of Saigon and its immediate surroundings. The Hop Tac program of
                            pacification in this area has not been an unqualified success, but <pb xml:id="pg_177" n="177" facs="0209"/>it has not been a failure, and
                            it has certainly prevented any strangling siege of Saigon. We did not
                            have a chance to form an independent judgment on Hop Tac, but we did
                            conclude that whatever its precise measure of success, it is of great
                            importance that this operation be pursued with full vigor. That is the
                            current policy of the mission.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. The Political Situation</p>
                        <p>Next only to the overall state of the struggle against the Viet Cong, the
                            shape and structure of the government is the most important element of
                            the Saigon situation. We made it our particular business to examine the
                            question whether and to what degree a stable government is a necessity
                            for the successful prosecution of our policy in Vietnam. We reached a
                            mixed conclusion.</p>
                        <p>For immediate purposes—and especially for the initiation of reprisal
                            policy, we believe that the government need be no stronger than it is
                            today with General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as the
                            focus of raw power while a weak caretaker government goes through the
                            motions. Such a government can execute military decisions and it can
                            give formal political support to joint US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy. That is about all it can do.</p>
                        <p>In the longer run, it is necessary that a government be established which
                            will in one way or another be able to maintain its political authority
                            against all challenges over a longer time than the governments of the
                            last year and a half.</p>
                        <p>The composition and direction of such a government is a most difficult
                            problem, and we do not wholly agree with the mission in our estimate of
                            its nature.</p>
                        <p>The mood of the mission with respect to the prospect of obtaining such a
                            government is one of pessimism and frustration. This is only natural in
                            terms of the events of the past many weeks. Two dominant themes
                            predominate: a government headed by <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will be difficult if not impossible to deal with
                            and, in any case, would be short lived; the Buddhists (or, more
                            specifically, the few politically activist bonzes) must be confronted
                            and faced down (by military means if necessary) lest they maintain their
                            power to unseat any government that does not bow to their every demand.
                            We tend to differ with the mission on both counts.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we believe that General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, with all his faults, is by long odds the
                            outstanding military man currently in sight—and the most impressive
                            personality generally. We do not share the conclusion of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that he must somehow
                            be removed from the military and political scene.</p>
                        <p>There are strong reasons for the Ambassador's total lack of confidence in
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. At least twice
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has acted in ways
                            that directly spoiled Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s high hopes for December. When he abolished the
                            High National Council he undercut the prospect of the stable <pb xml:id="pg_178" n="178" facs="0210"/>government needed for Phase II
                            action against the North. In January he overthrew Huong just when the
                            latter, in the Embassy's view, was about to succeed in putting the
                            bonzes in their place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is not an easy man to
                            deal with. It is clear that he takes a highly tactical view of truth,
                            although General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>
                            asserts that <hi rend="italic">Khanh</hi> has never deceived him. He is
                            intensely ambitious and intent above all else on maintaining and
                            advancing his own power. He gravely lacks the confidence of many of his
                            colleagues—military and civilian—and he seems not to be personally
                            popular with the public. He is correctly assessed as tricky. He remains
                            able, energetic, perceptive and resilient, and in our judgment he will
                            pursue the fight against the Communists as long as he can count on U.S.
                            help. (If he should conclude that the U.S. was violently against him
                            personally, he might well seek a way to power by some anti-American
                            path, a path which would lead to disaster for both Vietnam and the
                            United States.)</p>
                        <p>But our principal reason for opposing any sharp break with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is that we see no one else in
                            sight with anything like his ability to combine military authority with
                            some sense of politics.</p>
                        <p>We also differ from the Embassy in our estimate of the Buddhist leaders.
                            The dominant Embassy view is that “the Buddhists” are really just a
                            handful of irresponsible and designing clerics and that they must be
                            curbed by firmness. We agree that they may well have to be limited at
                            some point, especially in their use of mobs, but we also think they must
                            be offered some accommodation.</p>
                        <p>We feel that the operative concept should be incorporation into the
                            affairs of government rather than confrontation. This is easier said
                            than done, because the Buddhists have many of the bad habits of men who
                            have prospered by irresponsible opposition. Still there are signs that
                            both Buddhist laymen and bonzes are now taking a more positive stance.
                            We feel that the mission might do more in attempting to direct or
                            channel the Buddhists into a more useful and positive role—an active
                            rather than a passive approach. The Buddhists now play a key role in the
                            balance of political forces, so that something more than “confrontation”
                            must be achieved if there is to be any active government at all.</p>
                        <p>Having registered these two immediate and important differences of
                            emphasis, we should add that in our judgment the mission has acted at
                            about the right level of general involvement in the problem of
                            Vietnamese government-making. American advice is sought by all elements,
                            and all try to bend it to their own ends. The mission attempts to keep
                            before all elements the importance of stable government, and it quietly
                            presses the value of those who are known to be good, solid, able
                            ministerial timber.</p>
                        <p>In a situation in which confidence is low and uncertainty great, strongly
                            ambitious forces like <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and
                            the Buddhists might react very <pb xml:id="pg_179" n="179" facs="0211"/>vigorously against an overt American attempt to form or actively
                            support a government against their liking. Anti-Americanism is a theme
                            that is potentially explosive, and therefore tempting to those who feel
                            that we are blocking their ambitions. This is one lesson, to us, of the
                            outburst in Hue last month.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, no power whose stake is as great and whose presence as
                            clear as those of the United States in Vietnam can afford to stand aside
                            entirely, and such a passive posture would not be understood or approved
                            by the Vietnamese themselves.</p>
                        <p>It is important, therefore, that the mission maintain a constant and
                            active concern with the politics of government-making. This it is doing.
                            While it is very difficult to second-guess this effort, we do recommend
                            a telegram of guidance which might take into account the marginal
                            differences from mission thinking which are suggested above. In the
                            light of further discussion, a message of this sort will be drafted for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Strengthening the Pacification Program</p>
                        <p>If we suppose that new hopes are raised—at least temporarily—by a
                            reprisal program, and if we suppose further that a government somewhat
                            better than the bare minimum is established, the most urgent order of
                            business will then be the improvement and broadening of the pacification
                            program, especially in its non-military elements.</p>
                        <p>The mission fully concurs in the importance of this effort. We believe,
                            however, that consideration should be given to important modifications
                            in its organization for this purpose. In particular we believe that
                            there should be intensive effort to strengthen our program at the margin
                            between military advice and economic development—in the area which
                            implies civil government for the soldiers and police action for the aid
                            mission. These efforts, important as they are understood to be, are
                            somehow at the edge of vision for both parties. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and his people inevitably
                            think first of military programs, though they have been imaginative and
                            understanding about the importance of other aspects. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> people are centrally concerned with problems of aid
                            and of economic improvement, although they talk with conviction and
                            energy about their increasing police effort. It remains a fact that its
                            own organization for helping to provide real security for an area which
                            has been “cleared” in crude military terms is unfinished business for
                            the U.S. mission. What is true of our side is doubly true of the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>We do not offer a definite solution to this problem. We are inclined to
                            suggest, however, that one important and unemployed asset is the Special
                            Forces of the Defense Department. Because of the predominant role of the
                            U.S. military, and because of the generous spirit and broad mind of <pb xml:id="pg_180" n="180" facs="0212"/>General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> himself, we are inclined
                            to believe that the easiest growing edge for this work may be through
                            the use of some of these versatile and flexible units.</p>
                        <p>We would think it important, however, that an effort of this kind be
                            coordinated at a high level between the Defense Department and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and we believe that a joint mission
                            which would include either Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>
                            from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is urgently needed for the
                            purpose of building this missing link into our program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. A Sense of Positive Hope</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese talk is full of the need for “revolution.” Vietnamese practice
                            is empty of action to match the talk—so much so that the word
                            “revolution” sometimes seems to have no real meaning. Yet in fact there
                            is plainly a deep and strong yearning among the young and the
                            unprivileged for a new and better social order. This is what the
                            Buddhist leaders are groping toward; this is what the students and young
                            Turk generals are seeking. This yearning does not find an adequate
                            response in American policy as Vietnamese see it. This is one cause of
                            latent anti-American feeling. We only perceived this problem toward the
                            end of our visit. We think it needs urgent further attention. We make no
                            present recommendations. We do believe that over the long pull our
                            military and political firmness must be matched by our political and
                            economic support for the hopes that are embodied to Vietnamese in the
                            word “revolution.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. The Basic U.S. Commitment</p>
                        <p>The prospect in Vietnam is grim. The energy and persistence of the Viet
                            Cong are astonishing. They can appear anywhere—and at almost any time.
                            They have accepted extraordinary losses and they come back for more.
                            They show skill in their sneak attacks and ferocity when cornered. Yet
                            the weary country does not want them to win.</p>
                        <p>There are a host of things the Vietnamese need to do better and areas in
                            which we need to help them. The place where we can help most is in the
                            clarity and firmness of our own commitment to what is in fact as well as
                            in rhetoric a common cause. There is one grave weakness in our posture
                            in Vietnam which is within our own power to fix—and that is a widespread
                            belief that we do not have the will and force and patience and
                            determination to take the necessary action and stay the course.</p>
                        <p>This is the overriding reason for our present recommendation of a policy
                            of sustained reprisal. Once such a policy is put in force, we shall be
                            able to speak in Vietnam on many topics and in many ways, with growing
                            force and effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>One final word. At its very best the struggle in Vietnam will be long. It
                            seems to us important that this fundamental fact be made clear and our
                            understanding of it be made clear to our own people and to the people of

                            past we have conveyed the impression that we expect an early solution
                            when those who live with this war know that no early solution is
                            possible. It is our own belief that the people of the United States have
                            the necessary will to accept and to execute a policy that rests upon the
                            reality that there is no short cut to success in South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Introductory</p>
                        <p>We believe that the best available way of increasing our chance of
                            success in Vietnam is the development and execution of a policy of
                            sustained reprisal against North Vietnam—a policy in which air and naval
                            action against the North is justified by and related to the whole Viet
                            Cong campaign of violence and terror in the South.</p>
                        <p>While we believe that the risks of such a policy are acceptable, we
                            emphasize that its costs are real. It implies significant U.S. air
                            losses even if no full air war is joined, and it seems likely that it
                            would eventually require an extensive and costly effort against the
                            whole air defense system of North Vietnam. U.S. casualties would be
                            higher—and more visible to American feelings—than those sustained in the
                            struggle in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Yet measured against the costs of defeat in Vietnam, this program seems
                            cheap. And even if it fails to turn the tide—as it may—the value of the
                            effort seems to us to exceed its cost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Outline of the Policy</p>
                        <p>1. In partnership with the Government of Vietnam, we should develop and
                            exercise the option to retaliate against any <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> act of violence to persons or property.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_182" n="182" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>2. In practice, we may wish at the outset to relate our reprisals to
                            those acts of relatively high visibility such as the Pleiku incident.
                            Later, we might retaliate against the assassination of a province chief,
                            but not necessarily the murder of a hamlet official; we might retaliate
                            against a grenade thrown into a crowded cafe in Saigon, but not
                            necessarily to a shot fired into a small shop in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>3. Once a program of reprisals is clearly underway, it should not be
                            necessary to connect each specific act against North Vietnam to a
                            particular outrage in the South. It should be possible, for example, to
                            publish weekly lists of outrages in the South and to have it clearly
                            understood that these outrages are the cause of such action against the
                            North as may be occurring in the current period. Such a more generalized
                            pattern of reprisal would remove much of the difficulty involved in
                            finding precisely matching targets in response to specific atrocities.
                            Even in such a more general pattern, however, it would be important to
                            insure that the general level of reprisal action remained in close
                            correspondence with the level of outrages in the South. We must keep it
                            clear at every stage both to Hanoi and to the world, that our reprisals
                            will be reduced or stopped when outrages in the South are reduced or
                            stopped—and that we are not attempting to destroy or conquer North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. In the early stages of such a course, we should take the appropriate
                            occasion to make clear our firm intent to undertake reprisals on any
                            further acts, major or minor, that appear to us and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as indicating Hanoi's support. We would
                            announce that our two governments have been patient and forbearing in
                            the hope that Hanoi would come to its senses without the necessity of
                            our having to take further action; but the outrages continue and now we
                            must react against those who are responsible; we will not provoke; we
                            will not use our force indiscriminately; but we can no longer sit by in
                            the face of repeated acts of terror and violence for which the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is responsible.</p>
                        <p>5. Having once made this announcement, we should execute our reprisal
                            policy with as low a level of public noise as possible. It is to our
                            interest that our acts should be seen—but we do not wish to boast about
                            them in ways that make it hard for Hanoi to shift its ground. We should
                            instead direct maximum attention to the continuing acts of violence
                            which are the cause of our continuing reprisals.</p>
                        <p>6. This reprisal policy should begin at a low level. Its level of force
                            and pressure should be increased only gradually—and as indicated above
                            it should be decreased if VC terror visibly decreases. The object would
                            not be to “win” an air war against Hanoi, but rather to influence the
                            course of the struggle in the South.</p>
                        <p>7. At the same time it should be recognized that in order to maintain the
                            power of reprisal without risk of excessive loss, an “air war” may in
                            fact be necessary. We should therefore be ready to develop a separate
                                <pb xml:id="pg_183" n="183" facs="0215"/>justification for energetic
                            flak suppression and if necessary for the destruction of Communist air
                            power. The essence of such an explanation should be that these actions
                            are intended solely to insure the effectiveness of a policy of reprisal,
                            and in no sense represent any intent to wage offensive war against the
                            North. These distinctions should not be difficult to develop.</p>
                        <p>8. It remains quite possible, however, that this reprisal policy would
                            get us quickly into the level of military activity contemplated in the
                            so-called Phase II of our December planning. It may even get us beyond
                            this level with both Hanoi and Peiping, if there is Communist
                            counter-action. We and the GVN should also be prepared for a spurt of VC
                            terrorism, especially in urban areas, that would dwarf anything yet
                            experienced. These are the risks of any action. They should be carefully
                            reviewed—but we believe them to be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>9. We are convinced that the political values of reprisal require a
                            continuous operation. Episodic responses geared on a one-for-one basis
                            to “spectacular” outrages would lack the persuasive force of sustained
                            pressure. More important still, they would leave it open to the
                            Communists to avoid reprisals entirely by giving up only a small element
                            of their own program. The Gulf of Tonkin affair produced a sharp upturn
                            in morale in South Vietnam. When it remained an isolated episode,
                            however, there was a severe relapse. It is the great merit of the
                            proposed scheme that to stop it the Communists would have to stop enough
                            of their activity in the South to permit the probable success of a
                            determined pacification effort.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Expected Effect of Sustained Reprisal
                            Policy</p>
                        <p>1. We emphasize that our primary target in advocating a reprisal policy
                            is the improvement of the situation in South Vietnam. Action against the
                            North is usually urged as a means of affecting the will of Hanoi to
                            direct and support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We consider
                            this an important but longer-range purpose. The immediate and critical
                            targets are in the South—in the minds of the South Vietnamese and in the
                            minds of the Viet Cong cadres.</p>
                        <p>2. Predictions of the effect of any given course of action upon the
                            states of mind of people are difficult. It seems very clear that if the
                            United States and the Government of Vietnam join in a policy of
                            reprisal, there will be a sharp immediate increase in optimism in the
                            South, among nearly all articulate groups. The Mission believes—and our
                            own conversations confirm—that in all sectors of Vietnamese opinion
                            there is a strong belief that the United States could do much more if it
                            would, and that they are suspicious of our failure to use more of our
                            obviously enormous power. At least in the short run, the reaction to
                            reprisal policy would be very favorable.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_184" n="184" facs="0216"/>
                        <p>3. This favorable reaction should offer opportunity for increased
                            American influence in pressing for a more effective government—at least
                            in the short run. Joint reprisals would imply military planning in which
                            the American role would necessarily be controlling, and this new
                            relation should add to our bargaining power in other military
                            efforts—and conceivably on a wider plane as well if a more stable
                            government is formed. We have the whip hand in reprisals as we do not in
                            other fields.</p>
                        <p>4. The Vietnamese increase in hope could well increase the readiness of
                            Vietnamese factions themselves to join together in forming a more
                            effective government.</p>
                        <p>5. We think it plausible that effective and sustained reprisals, even in
                            a low key, would have a substantial depressing effect upon the morale of
                            Viet Cong cadres in South Vietnam. This is the strong opinion of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Saigon. It is based upon reliable
                            reports of the initial Viet Cong reaction to the Gulf of Tonkin episode,
                            and also upon the solid general assessment that the determination of
                            Hanoi and the apparent timidity of the mighty United States are both
                            major items in Viet Cong confidence.</p>
                        <p>6. The long-run effect of reprisals in the South is far less clear. It
                            may be that like other stimulants, the value of this one would decline
                            over time. Indeed the risk of this result is large enough so that we
                            ourselves believe that a very major effort all along the line should be
                            made in South Vietnam to take full advantage of the immediate stimulus
                            of reprisal policy in its early stages. Our object should be to use this
                            new policy to effect a visible upward turn in pacification, in
                            governmental effectiveness, in operations against the Viet Cong, and in
                            the whole U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relationship. It is
                            changes in these areas that can have enduring long-term effects.</p>
                        <p>7. While emphasizing the importance of reprisals in the South, we do not
                            exclude the impact on Hanoi. We believe, indeed, that it is of great
                            importance that the level of reprisal be adjusted rapidly and visibly to
                            both upward and downward shifts in the level of Viet Cong offenses. We
                            want to keep before Hanoi the carrot of our desisting as well as the
                            stick of continued pressure. We also need to conduct the application of
                            the force so that there is always a prospect of worse to come.</p>
                        <p>8. We cannot assert that a policy of sustained reprisal will succeed in
                            changing the course of the contest in Vietnam. It may fail, and we
                            cannot estimate the odds of success with any accuracy—they may be
                            somewhere between 25% and 75%. What we can say is that even if it fails,
                            the policy will be worth it. At a minimum it will damp down the charge
                            that we did not do all that we could have done, and this charge will be
                            important in many countries, including our own. Beyond that, a reprisal
                            policy—to the extent that it demonstrates U.S. willingness to employ
                            this new norm in counter-insurgency—will set a higher price for the
                            future upon all adventures of guerrilla warfare, and it should therefore
                            somewhat <pb xml:id="pg_185" n="185" facs="0217"/>increase our ability
                            to deter such adventures. We must recognize, however, that that ability
                            will be gravely weakened if there is failure for any reason in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Present Action Recommendations</p>
                        <p>1. This general recommendation was developed in intensive discussions in
                            the days just before the attacks on Pleiku. These attacks and our
                            reaction to them have created an ideal opportunity for the prompt
                            development and execution of sustained reprisals. Conversely, if no such
                            policy is now developed, we face the grave danger that Pleiku, like the
                            Gulf of Tonkin, may be a short-run stimulant and a long-term depressant.
                            We therefore recommend that the necessary preparations be made for
                            continuing reprisals. The major necessary steps to be taken appear to us
                            to be the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) We should complete the evacuation of dependents.</p>
                        <p>(2) We should quietly start the necessary westward deployments of back-up
                            contingency forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) We should develop and refine a running catalogue of Viet Cong
                            offenses which can be published regularly and related clearly to our own
                            reprisals. Such a catalogue should perhaps build on the foundation of an
                            initial White Paper.</p>
                        <p>(4) We should initiate joint planning with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on both the civil and military level. Specifically, we
                            should give a clear and strong signal to those now forming a government
                            that we will be ready for this policy when they are.</p>
                        <p>(5) We should develop the necessary public and diplomatic statements to
                            accompany the initiation and continuation of this program.</p>
                        <p>(6) We should insure that a reprisal program is matched by renewed public
                            commitment to our family of programs in the South, so that the central
                            importance of the southern struggle may never be neglected.</p>
                        <p>(7) We should plan quiet diplomatic communication of the precise meaning
                            of what we are and are not doing, to Hanoi, to Peking and to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>(8) We should be prepared to defend and to justify this new policy by
                            concentrating attention in every forum upon its cause—the aggression in
                            the South.</p>
                        <p>(9) We should accept discussion on these terms in any forum, but we
                            should not now accept the idea of negotiations of any sort except on the
                            basis of a stand down of Viet Cong violence. A program of sustained
                            reprisal, with its direct link to Hanoi's continuing aggressive actions
                            in the South, will not involve us in nearly the level of international
                            recrimination which would be precipitated by a go-North program which
                            was not so connected. For this reason the international pressures for
                            negotiation should be quite manageable.</p>

                            for assistance in permitting us to carry out the “orderly withdrawal of
                            American dependents from South Vietnam” announced in your statement of
                            February 8.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">The statement was released on

                            desk this morning, it is apparent that your decision is being
                            interpreted as requiring use of standard emergency evacuation
                            procedures. These procedures call for rapid outshipment of dependents on
                            military aircraft to intermediate “safe-havens” where they are
                            temporarily held pending a second move to destinations. Such methods are
                            not required by or suitable for the situation here where we wish to give
                            the impression of leaving SVN with dignity and composure. You are aware,
                            I am sure, over our concern lest a precipitous departure alarm our
                            Vietnamese friends and create unjustified fears.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the inevitability of eventual evacuation of dependents we
                            have been working quietly for some time on an orderly evacuation plan
                            based on the movement of dependents to destination in commercial and
                            MATS passenger aircraft without passage through safe-havens. We estimate
                            that we can carry out this plan in a week to ten days with minimum
                            discomfort and inconvenience to the hundreds of families who learned for
                            the first time at breakfast this morning that their pattern of life soon
                            must change. I earnestly request to be allowed to continue to proceed in
                            accordance with this plan, which we have already begun to implement,
                            calling on outside agencies for help as the need is determined here.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that if
                            we had to destroy the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> airplanes now
                            in North Vietnam we would have to adopt Phase II of the December program
                            plus additional actions.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that
                            sooner or later the MIGs would come in. As U.S. air strikes are made on
                            targets farther north, intervention of the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s is to be expected.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it were true that very quickly we would be
                            required to take out the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said yes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was
                            not necessary for us to conduct a raid a day but one raid each week
                            would be enough to keep morale up in Saigon. He said the situation might
                            not come to a head for three to six weeks. We need not now say that we
                            have approved Phase II but we should explain to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that our present decisions
                            involve actions less than those contemplated in Phase II. As soon as we
                            tell Khanh we are going to undertake future actions, we can urge him to
                            move forward as quickly as possible to establish a stable government in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The President said we face a choice of going forward or running. We have
                            chosen the first alternative. All of us agree on this but there remains
                            some difference as to how fast we should go forward.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question as to what the Congressional leaders should be
                            told when they joined the group for the formal NSC Meeting at 10:30, the
                            President said he would ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to report on the South Vietnamese raid and to
                            give any new information about the U.S. raid of the day before. The
                            President then said he would explain that in December we had decided
                            that the time was coming for intensified U.S. efforts which required a
                            stable government in Saigon. Before we could undertake these efforts we
                            had to make a new attempt to create stability in Saigon and to withdraw
                            our dependents. We haven't won on the stable government but unless we do
                            something now, even the government which now exists will collapse. The
                            dependents are coming home.</p>

                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to begin the meeting by reporting on the
                            results of the U.S. raid in North Vietnam which took place yesterday
                            against the Dong Hoi barracks.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that bomb
                            damage photographs indicated ten buildings were hit, two damaged, others
                            burning. He described the raid as being moderate to good. He also
                            reported on the air strike carried out by the South Vietnamese Air
                            Force, with U.S. assistance, against the Chap Le army barracks. He said
                            there were very good results from this strike based on reports received
                            so far.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> spoke of the
                            effect of the North Vietnamese attack on Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit to Hanoi. He said it
                            may be that Soviet Union was not aware of plans for the North Vietnamese
                            attack. If so, they may have been mouse-trapped by Hanoi. If they had
                            known of the attack, the Russians might not have sent Kosygin to Hanoi.
                            The North Vietnamese action has put the Russians on the spot. We have
                            talked to the Russians in an effort to explain why we had to retaliate
                            as we did. Our hope is that they will understand why we acted as we did,
                            at least to the extent of being annoyed by the North Vietnamese
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> informed the group that
                            we had sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations a letter<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                February 22, 1965, pp. 240–241.</note> stating our case. The purpose
                            of this letter was to preempt any effort of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member to call a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council Meeting to discuss the situation in Vietnam. We are
                            quite ready to explain our case to the Security Council but we wish to
                            control the circumstances of that discussion. He recalled when we had
                            proceeded in a similar manner following the DeSoto Patrol incident in
                            the Gulf of Tonkin.</p>

                            conversation with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. He said he had told the Ambassador that we had
                            canceled a proposed patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin to be certain that no
                            embarrassing incident would take place during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit to Hanoi. However, we
                            had been forced to react when the Viet Cong attacked our personnel,
                            wounding a number of men and killing seven. (Summary of the <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> conversation is attached, Tab A.)<note n="3" xml:id="d87fn3">

                        </p>
                        <p>The President asked all of those present to preserve the secrecy of the
                            various ways we communicate with the Russians. He said he had authorized
                            the discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> because of the importance of conveying our
                            views to the Russians. He did not want such conversations to become
                            known to the public.</p>
                        <p>The President then summarized our present position as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Last December we had approved a program of further pressure against
                            North Vietnam but did not initiate actions for the time being, in order
                            to allow Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> a
                            period of time in which we hoped he would be able to assist the
                            Vietnamese in creating a stable government in Saigon. In addition, we
                            delayed action pending the time when U.S. dependents could be evacuated
                            from the area.</p>
                        <p>2. We are now ready to return to our program of pushing forward in an
                            effort to defeat North Vietnamese aggression without escalating the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>3. We were surprised by the attack on our personnel at Pleiku but we had
                            to respond. If we had failed to respond we would have conveyed to Hanoi,
                            Peking and Moscow our lack of interest in the fate of the South
                            Vietnamese government. In addition, the South Vietnamese would have
                            thought we had abandoned them.</p>
                        <p>4. There is a bad governmental situation in Saigon but it is our hope
                            that current U.S. action may pull together the various forces in Saigon
                            and thus make possible the establishment of a stable government. He
                            concluded by saying that U.S. dependents would be out of Saigon in about
                            two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked if he
                            had understood correctly that we had cancelled a patrol in the Gulf of
                            Tonkin because of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            presence in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that we had canceled the patrol because we wanted
                            to avoid any appearance of provocation while <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was in North Vietnam. Despite this action on our
                            part, the Viet Cong had carried out an attack which was highly
                            provocative to us.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> then summarized
                            the findings and recommendations of his report to the President. (A copy
                            of the report is attached. Tab B).<note n="4" xml:id="d87fn4">
                                <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President then read a battle damage report of the attack on the Chap
                            Le barracks and on the Dong Hoi target. (The document from which he read
                            is attached. Tab C.)<note n="5" xml:id="d87fn5">Attached, but not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> spoke of the difficulty of
                            insuring the security at the Pleiku base. He described the dropping of
                            mortars and went into the details with respect to what he described as a
                            skillful sneak attack. He said the only real security for an airfield is
                            full combat control of the perimeter two miles out from the field. In
                            guerrilla warfare such as exists in Vietnam, there are no rear areas. He
                            called attention to the fact that we must rely on the Vietnamese to
                            carry out the security task because our forces are there as advisers and
                            are insufficient in number to insure security of such an area as the
                            Pleiku airfield.</p>
                        <p>Further details of the Vietnamese attack were given by General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> who, as a member of the
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> group, had just returned from the area
                            and had discussed the attack with those who were engaged.</p>
                        <p>The President added that we were up against highly skilled guerrilla
                            fighters. He said there is no way to insure against such attacks as that
                            which occurred at Pleiku short of sending a very large number of U.S.
                            troops to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> was now
                            recommending the program proposed last December.<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> was referring to the
                                program of action that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> apparently described to members of the House
                                Foreign Affairs Committee on December 3, 1964; see vol. I, p.
                                974.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President responded by saying that Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> had
                            brought back from Saigon the views of our country team there. These
                            views had been discussed with the President's advisers and an agreed
                            recommendation had been made to the President.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked whether
                            the program involved additional U.S. personnel and additional financial
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that our present needs are met. If the response to
                            our action is larger than we expect, we will then of course make a
                            request for a larger amount of U.S. military assistance and will need
                            additional personnel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said that events
                            had forced us to act as we have—that action had not been based on his
                            group's findings. A rolling consensus <pb xml:id="pg_191" n="191" facs="0223"/>as to the proper course of action had developed after
                            he returned to Washington from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked whether
                            all we intended to do was to react to Viet Cong provocations.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that all Viet Cong actions did call for a response
                            but we did not intend to limit our actions to retaliating against Viet
                            Cong attacks.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen asked what effect on the morale of our forces in Vietnam
                            and on South Vietnamese government itself would result from our decision
                            to move our dependents out of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that
                            our action would be explained on the basis of our intention to clear the
                            decks for further action rather than as an indication of our intention
                            to retreat.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen asked what the effect would be if the United States
                            pulled out of South Vietnam.<note n="7" xml:id="d87fn7">In a February 8

                                    Rowan</persName> noted, “When Senator Dirksen today raised the
                                question of what would happen if we decided to pull out of Vietnam
                                completely, I passed you a note indicating that a <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> study indicates that there would
                                be dismay in many parts of the world, especially in countries like
                                India and Japan. This note was based on a compilation of world
                                opinion that I asked my Research Service to do just a few days ago.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> said he was
                                forwarding this compilation to the President “in the event that you
                                will find it useful in discussions with others who may be
                                entertaining the notion that we can turn tail and run out of Viet
                                Nam without suffering drastic consequences in other parts of the
                                world.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File,

                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> replied that if we
                            pulled out there would be a strong feeling in the nations of Southeast
                            Asia that we had failed to carry out our policy of assisting the
                            Vietnamese to continue as an independent state. The consequences in
                            Southeast Asia of our pull-out would be very large. In other parts of
                            the world, the effect would also be very serious, even to the extent of
                            affecting the morale in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen asked Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> what the reaction of the Chinese Communists would
                            be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said we did not know
                            as yet, but he recalled that Peking's reaction to the Gulf of Tonkin
                            incident had been minor.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Congressional Resolution on Vietnam plus the
                            legal power of the Presidency made it possible for him to carry out at a
                            manageable level an effort to deter, destroy and diminish the strength
                            of the North Vietnamese aggressors and to try to convince them to leave
                            South Vietnam alone. He said that the views of a few Senators could not
                            control his actions. He intended to use the Congressional Resolution
                            carefully but effectively. He repeated his view that we now have in
                            Saigon the best possible people. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had his pick of personnel <pb xml:id="pg_192" n="192" facs="0224"/>throughout the world. It is true that we have
                            real trouble in Vietnam but we are not going to pull out.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen asked what use could be made of the information which he
                            had heard during the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he had instructed <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> to talk to the press, telling them as
                            much as he possibly could without affecting the national interest.<note n="8" xml:id="d87fn8">A transcript of <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#p_RG1">George Reedy</persName>'s White House Background Briefing on

                            We can say that if the Vietnamese will cease their aggression, we will
                            pull out. He asked those present not to discuss publicly our military
                            actions but he said they could say that our actions would be kept at a

                            the situation in Vietnam<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">
                                <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> and then gave an oral
                            appraisal of the situation.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_193" n="193" facs="0225"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> took the position that
                            more dynamic action was indicated than reprisals. I stated that we
                            should pursue a systematic series of attacks against targets, starting
                            in the south sector of North Vietnam and that we should work toward the
                            north. I emphasized that the capacity for defense by the North
                            Vietnamese would unquestionably increase with the passage of time—and
                            not very much time at that—and therefore we should get going. I
                            therefore questioned whether our posture should be one of reprisal. I
                            emphasized that we should implement Phase II of the agreed plan and if
                            any thing, should step it up. I reported that this had been my
                            recommendation to the President a few days ago in a private
                                conversation.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Apparently a reference to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s meeting with
                                the President at 3:25 p.m. on February 3; see <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note> (Note: The President, talking later
                            with Ball, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and myself privately, recalled that I had
                            warned him that some catastrophic event was bound to happen and that he
                            had to take positive actions against the North.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> generally agreed, indicating that his use of
                            the word reprisal inferred a continuing series of actions, but that they
                            would be “publicized as reprisals.” He said he did not feel that we
                            should just sit back until another Pleiku incident occurred and then
                            start another reprisal. However, it was obvious that
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> was shifting his ground somewhat as his
                            paper pretty definitely ties reprisals to specific acts of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. <persName>Bundy</persName> warned of the
                            danger of lifting the problem off the shoulders of the South Vietnamese
                            and creating a North Vietnamese-U.S. war situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed with my concept. He
                            seemed to argue for positive action. He thought that slow action would
                            be costly and quick action on our part and sustained action might very
                            possibly affect ChiCom and Soviet reactions which would be more
                            favorable to our purpose than otherwise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName> stated that faster action
                            may bring us to the conference table earlier than otherwise.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> raised the question of whether we should
                            go to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then
                            summarized the situation as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. There was no disagreement around the table that more military actions
                            by the U.S. against the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> were
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>2. Actions against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would soon bring a
                            confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s and we must
                            expect that we would be obliged to take the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s out in 3 to 6 weeks.</p>
                        <p>After an extended discussion it was agreed that
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> were in substantial agreement that the action
                            must be dynamic, must be positive, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s statement that we would be in confrontation
                            with <pb xml:id="pg_194" n="194" facs="0226"/>the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s between 3 to 6 weeks was probably
                            correct and that at that point we would have to take them out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> issued a word of
                            caution. He thought that further strikes would cause the Soviets to
                            move. He reasoned we should not do anything until the Soviets come in
                            with their response and seemed to be implying that our whole South
                            Vietnamese policy must be governed by what the Soviets say. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reviewed his talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in which he made the
                            point that the North Vietnamese had mousetrapped the Soviets by
                            conducting this Pleiku raid during Kosygin's presence in an effort to
                            force <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to make greater
                            concessions to Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
                            believed that the Soviets would invite a conference.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> then spoke of the
                            improving Air Defense of North Vietnam, the installation of radar and
                            ground control equipment, the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s at
                            Phuc Yen and the possibility of moving them south. Militarily, he said,
                            the cheapest thing would be to take all the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s out right now. However, he agreed that a more gradual
                            approach would probably be more feasible. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then developed what he called the Y Theory,
                            stating that we were now on the lower leg of a Y and would have to
                            decide at some future time which branch we were to go on. Throughout
                            this exchange there was considerable discussion as to the degree of
                            escalation. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued with
                            the position that time increases the risk of outside involvement. Also
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> entered into the
                            discussion and urged that we not do anything for a couple of days until
                            we see what signals come out of Moscow.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the political stability of South
                            Vietnam. In the final analysis it was <persName>Bundy</persName>'s
                            opinion and all seemed to agree that our actions could be used to
                            influence Saigon to “pull up their socks.” <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            reviewed his two meetings with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. The first, upon his arrival which was cold and
                            distant, both kind of feeling their way. The second, after the Pleiku
                            incident at which he informed <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> of our decision to react, which was a warm, frank
                            and entirely satisfactory meeting. Bundy has considerably more
                            confidence in Khanh than is held by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> or our Mission. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> then raised the question if we
                            should exacerbate the situation in anticipation of the March 1st meeting
                            of the Communist Parties. Throughout the morning he seemed to be raising
                            issues designed to stop action rather than move.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated
                            positively that we should move forward and should keep going.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> summarized the sense of the meeting that
                            without dissent, all agreed to act, that we should apply force against
                            the North, that it should be done against targets out of range of the
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s, that we should use this
                            decision to stimulate Saigon to form a government that was viable, that
                            we should be careful and not announce this decision prior to receiving
                            the signal from the Soviets and that the actions should stay at <pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0227"/>the low level, i.e., should be
                            directed towards targets in the south rather than Phuc Yen Base.</p>
                        <p>The President entered and heard <persName>Bundy</persName>'s summary.</p>
                        <p>The President then raised the question of a stable government, stating
                            that he was concerned that in December we placed the establishment of a
                            stable government as a first priority and things had gone down hill
                            since then, not up. For that reason many of the decisions made in
                            December were not carried out. Bundy confirmed that we had made
                            contingency decisions, that they were very fluid, but nothing was done
                            because of the internal South Vietnam political problem.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> then reviewed in some considerable detail
                            the political developments in Saigon in December and January. The
                            President raised the question of how to go about getting the best
                            possible government in South Vietnam and the consensus seemed to be that
                            since Max <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s efforts had
                            been futile probably dynamic action on our part would help. Throughout
                            the discussion Bundy indicated that in his discussions with many people,
                            including Buddhist, Bonzes, Catholics, Military, etc., there was a
                            feeling that perhaps the U.S. was going to pull out. Therefore, he
                            reasoned that action on our part and a restatement of our position would
                            be useful in reestablishing a strong government.</p>
                        <p>The President then re-asserted his determination to get the best possible
                            government. He also re-asserted his determination to get the dependents
                            out. He said that we were standing on shaky ground and he wished to
                            avoid a rapid escalation and therefore favored a gradual approach. He
                            summarized the choices as follows:<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">There was
                                apparently some confusion at this point in the dictation and
                                transcription of <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s
                                memorandum.</note> Get out of the area through a Conference. He
                            stated that in his opinion this was not the time as we would be
                            admitting defeat; therefore hoped that by careful and sustained
                            responses we would gain strength essential to stay in South Vietnam or
                            gain an appropriate position for a Conference. The President recognized
                            the problem of delaying until after <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> left Hanoi but he believed that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was there to give the North
                            Vietnamese substantial help. He then raised the question of what
                            specific instructions were to go to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. Should it be the December Phase II decision, or
                            this decision plus some more. He asked whether we want to commit
                            regardless of what the Soviets say. All agreed to the course of action
                            discussed above.</p>
                        <p>At this point I expressed very strong opinion that I felt that our
                            actions would not be positive enough, and would not be taken in a
                            sustained and consistent manner. I urged that we organize to strike
                            every day or at least every second day and that we carry it on
                            regardless of what the Soviets say or what the Chinese Communists say or
                            what anybody else says. In other words, my differing with the proposals
                            of <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_196" n="196" facs="0228"/>was that I proposed a more
                            rapid cadence of the operation; furthermore I agreed that we should make
                            a final effort to improve the government.</p>
                        <p>In summary of this part of the meeting, it appeared to me that starting
                            with the idea of “reprisals” which would be taken against specific acts
                            such as another Pleiku, the sense of the meeting turned in the direction
                            of sustained action which I advocated and others fell into line although
                            I am not sure from the discussions which ensued when the Leadership
                            appeared, that the President is fully committed to this course of

                        <p>Then Senators <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, Dirksen,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">McCormack</persName> entered. All others remained
                            except <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and 3 or 4 staff people. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized the situation as
                            mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> mentioned the political
                            problems such as <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            presence, belief that the North Vietnamese mousetrapped <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and stated that <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had addressed a letter to the
                            Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
                            reviewed his meeting at his residence on Sunday morning with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, at which time he gave
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the estimate that
                            Hanoi had acted to pressure <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> during his visit.</p>
                        <p>The President then reviewed the studies made in November-December, the
                            instructions given to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to
                            (1) create a strong government, (2) remove dependents, and (3) to
                            proceed with the courses of action agreed to and approved last
                            November.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> then made a report on his trip, emphasizing
                            that things have been going down hill; that one of the serious problems
                            was the doubt in the minds of a great many people concerning the U.S.
                            intentions. He emphasized disappointment in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> that the Tonkin Gulf incident, which gave a great lift,
                            was not pursued further and this caused the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> leaders to look over their shoulders at what was really
                            the U.S. intention and long-range purpose.</p>
                        <p>The President then questioned General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> about the security of our bases. He asked for an
                            explanation of why better security could not be provided. Wheeler stated
                            that security was in the hands of the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>; long-range mortars had about a 2–1/2 mile range and
                            the shorter range mortars about a mile or mile and a half range. He said
                            the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> had border patrols, but that
                            they had been successfully evaded. He wound up by stating that in a
                            guerrilla-type war it is impossible to protect an installation,
                            particularly an airfield.</p>
                        <p>Action: I don't believe this is true. I think that the Clandestine
                            Services might play a part here. It seems to me that we could create a
                            net of informants in the villages around each one of the airfields and
                            this might cost some money but would be so set up that we would be
                            advised. I have spoken to Helms about this and wish to see if it is at
                            all possible to work out a plan.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_197" n="197" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>Dirksen then asked if the Vietnam troops were well trained. <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> said, “Yes, generally,
                            although there are some variations.” <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked if <persName>Bundy</persName>'s
                            recommendations involved merely the carrying out of the operations
                            agreed upon in December. All agreed. Ford then asked if more money and
                            men are required. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said,
                            “not in the initial stages,” but he reserved his position and stated
                            that if any escalation beyond that expected developed, a supplemental
                            would be called for. The President supported him in that. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> then asked if our action was in
                            response to North Vietnamese action. The President made it clear that
                            this was what the case was. Dirksen asked what was the effect of the
                            removal of the dependents on the morale. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded that he thought there would be some
                            deterioration but it would not be bad because of the method that was
                            being employed.</p>
                        <p>Dirksen then asked about the results of a U.S. pullout from South
                            Vietnam, indicating that this would be hotly debated both in the Senate
                            Foreign Relations Committee and on the Floor. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            outlined the consequences which were the standard argument.</p>
                        <p>The President then wound up the meeting by stating that it was incumbent
                            upon him as President to conduct our activities in South Vietnam in
                            order to stop aggression and to destroy the aggressor if necessary but
                            in any event to take such actions as might be required in support of the
                            free peoples of South Vietnam.</p>

                                Memorandum</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We are inclined to expect a hard Soviet reaction to the North Vietnam
                            strikes, despite the fact that Soviet propaganda has been rather mild
                            thus far. (On important issues Soviet propaganda tends to be moderate
                            and imprecise until a governmental decision has been taken.)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>We believe that the Soviet Government will feel that it has received a
                            direct insult and challenge because of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s presence in Hanoi. The Soviets will probably
                            feel that their prestige has been seriously damaged and that they must
                            take some positive action to save face. Moreover they will be impelled
                            in the same direction by their desire to wean North Vietnam away from
                            China, and by their need to prove to smaller Communist states that
                            Soviet commitments are valid and Soviet protection dependable. Finally,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would appreciably reduce its
                            voice and influence in all of Southeast Asia by failure to respond to
                            what the Communists must consider a challenge. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could scarcely save its prestige if
                            it failed to act, when <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            only the day before repeated the Soviet Government's commitment: “We
                            sternly declare that the Soviet Union will not remain indifferent to the
                            destiny of a brotherly socialist country and is ready to give the
                            Democratic Republic of Vietnam all necessary assistance if the
                            aggressors dare to encroach upon the independence and sovereignty of the
                            Democratic Republic of Vietnam.”</p>
                        <p>The possibility that the Soviet Government will be angry with the North
                            Vietnamese for getting them into this uncomfortable position does not
                            reduce the pressures for action outlined above.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet reaction, we believe, will take two forms. First on the ground
                            itself the Soviet Government will probably grant extensive and
                            impressive military assistance to North Vietnam, particularly defensive
                            and perhaps also offensive air armament. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will also find its arguments in the Sino-Soviet
                            dispute weakened and be compelled to adjust itself, at least
                            superficially, toward the Chinese viewpoint. This is not to suggest,
                            however, that the Soviet Government will increase its risk of its own
                            forces' involvement in the Far Eastern conflict.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we believe U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> bilateral
                            relations will be affected adversely. The Soviet leadership will
                            undoubtedly consider as a personal challenge the fact that the U.S.
                            chose the moment of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            visit to attack North Vietnam, and will be little swayed by the argument
                            that provocation was given. It is difficult to estimate how serious and
                            widespread will be the damage to our bilateral relations. Obvious
                            possibilities are the cooling off on the exchange of high level visits,
                            demonstrations against our Moscow Embassy, a slowing up of cultural
                            exchanges, or a recall of their Ambassador for consultation. Even
                            increased harassment in Berlin can not be excluded.</p>
                        <p>In order to reduce the impact of these developments on our bilateral
                            relations we suggest that we should attempt to be as forthcoming as
                            possible on non-vital issues in those relations during the next few
                            weeks. For example, we might make an extra effort to obtain ratification
                            of the Consular Convention as soon as possible (if the temper of
                            Congress is not too adverse). Any action on our part which would enable
                            the Soviet Government <pb xml:id="pg_199" n="199" facs="0231"/>to point
                            to concrete gains for its “peaceful coexistence” policy would help to
                            blunt the Soviet reaction to the North Vietnam attacks.</p>
                        <p>Since the above was typed we have received the text of a Soviet
                            Government statement<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Not found.</note> which
                            tends to reinforce some of the foregoing points. In speaking of the
                            effect on U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> bilateral relations
                            the statement says:</p>
                        <p>“This process is incompatible with aggressive manifestations in politics,
                            capable of cancelling out various steps undertaken in the interests of
                            improving Soviet-American relations.”</p>
                        <p>The statement concludes:</p>
                        <p>“In the face of the above-mentioned U.S. actions, the Soviet Union will
                            be forced together with its allies and friends to take further measures
                            to safeguard the security and strengthen the defense capability of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. No one should doubt that the
                            Soviet Union will do this, that the Soviet people will fulfill its
                            international duty to the fraternal socialist country.”</p>

                        <p>Incomprehensibly to me, the White House memorandum discusses the risks of
                            sustained US air strikes against North Vietnam without examining Chinese
                            Communist responses. However, the two intelligence community products
                            estimate Chinese Communist air intervention to be quite likely at some
                            stage in this very process.</p>
                        <p>Again in a reversal of our hitherto conventional rationale on this
                            subject, the White House memorandum posits these strikes as primarily
                            directed toward improving morale in South Vietnam, and only secondarily
                            and eventually affecting North Vietnam's support for the war. The
                            intelligence community estimate of November 26 anticipates an initial
                            elation in South Vietnam followed by a further let-down if the attacks
                            against North Vietnam do not lead quickly to successes over the Viet
                            Cong. Finally, the White House memorandum tends to minimize Free World
                            reaction to US escalation whereas the November 26 estimate sees it as
                            overwhelmingly opposed to escalation once that threatens to engage
                            Chinese Communist forces.</p>

                        <p>1653. For Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> from
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName> has given me a full
                            report of his discussions with you and of the outstanding work which you
                            and all your team are doing.</p>
                        <p>2. In our discussions in December we agreed upon the importance of
                            undertaking appropriate action against North Vietnam. We then felt it
                            important to establish as strong a government as possible, and you have
                            been doing your level best to that end. It also seemed to me essential
                            to get women and children out of the area, and now we have taken that
                            decision. I am now prepared to go forward with the best government we
                            can get, and accordingly I wish you to know that I have today decided
                            that we will carry out our December plan for continuing action against
                            North Vietnam with modifications up and down in tempo and scale in the
                            light of your recommendations as Bundy reports them, and our own
                            continuing review of the situation.</p>
                        <p>3. It is most important that this decision not be publicized until we
                            have determined precise opening moves, and until Kosygin is safely out
                            of Hanoi. Moreover, we wish to make our own plans after assessing Soviet
                            reaction to recent events which should be more clear by time <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> leaves.</p>
                        <p>4. Evacuation of dependents should proceed as you determine. I hope you
                            can meet the 7–10 days suggested in your last message.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">

                        </p>
                        <p>5. I am impressed by argument that the building of a minimum government
                            will benefit by some private assurances from us to the highest levels
                            that we do now intend to take continuing action. Therefore, you are
                            authorized to convey this in general terms to key leaders and political
                            figures as you see fit. At the same time you should say that we want to
                            work with a unified and going government, and that the sooner they can
                            work out such a government, the better we can plan and execute the
                            continuing actions we have in mind.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">In

                            endeavored to make my position clear on the situation as it has
                            developed and may develop in Vietnam. I raised questions concerning the
                            advisability of the action which you and your advisors proposed to
                            undertake, not so much on the basis of the attack made on our
                            installation but in view of the future possibilities which might be
                            incurred by the retaliatory action.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s
                            analysis of the situation, it appears to me that what has happened in
                            North Vietnam will, in a sense, force <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s hand for a number of reasons:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was there when it
                            happened and he had just made a speech in which he said that the Soviet
                            Union would supply assistance to North Vietnam in its struggle against
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) A closer degree of cooperation by the Soviet Union and the Chinese
                            will be brought about because in view of what developed, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will have little choice to do
                            otherwise. It may well express itself in this situation by a resumption
                            of major Russian military aid to China and transference through China of
                            Soviet aid to North Vietnam. This would be most unfortunate because one
                            of the hopes of Western policy was to <pb xml:id="pg_204" n="204" facs="0236"/>encourage the split between the two great communist
                            powers, a hope which will now, I believe, lessen to a considerable
                            degree.</p>
                        <p>I raised questions about possible Chinese intervention and pointed out
                            that the Communist Chinese had recently completed roads into Laos which
                            could be used for troop and supply movements; that they had recently
                            completed an air-field infrastructure in North Vietnam and that they had
                            airfields and naval bases on the Island of Hainan, off the coast of the
                            northern part of North Vietnam and South China.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not the Chinese will intervene is a factor which only the
                            future holds the answer to, but an increase in at least indirect Chinese
                            intervention is to be anticipated.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out also that South Vietnam has a very unstable government and
                            that we could not depend upon it or the great majority of the population
                            therein. That is proved by news stories from reliable American officials
                            in today's press which state that there was plenty of opportunity for
                            advance warnings on the Pleiku attack but that the attack when it came
                            was, in effect, a complete surprise.</p>
                        <p>It is especially hard to understand why we were caught off-guard
                            ourselves, in view of the attack of November 1st on our force at Bien
                            Hoa, 12 miles outside of Saigon. Our own security arrangements were
                            certainly lax there and despite the explanation given at our meeting on
                            Saturday night, it appears to me they were lax at Pleiku. It is my
                            understanding that the American base at Pleiku is situated on a high
                            plain, dotted with brush here and there but certainly not the kind of
                            jungle area which surrounded Bien Hoa. While <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that it would be
                            extremely difficult to provide security two miles out, this is,
                            nevertheless, a matter which should be looked into especially in view of
                            the fact that aside from the more distant mortar shelling of the base,
                            rifle fire and hand grenades were used right inside the American
                            compound and explosives were placed against the barracks. This makes it
                            clear that the Viet Cong were in the compound as has been stated in the
                            press and proves that the security which was supposed to be furnished by
                            both the United States forces and the Vietnamese military was lax. It is
                            my understanding that more than half of the 23,000 U.S. personnel in
                            South Vietnam are stationed in Saigon. Certainly some of them could be
                            used to guard U.S. compounds. The explanations given this morning by
                            General Goodpaster and others, in my opinion, were not convincing.</p>
                        <p>At the recent meeting, I also pointed out that General Giap had an army
                            of 350,000 men, well-trained, and that he was and is one of the best
                            military tacticians in Asia.</p>
                        <p>It is disturbing to me, though understandable, that the retaliatory move
                            was essentially unilateral, initiated by us and then we had to wait
                            until the South Vietnamese government was informed in order that the
                            protocol of the situation might be maintained at least on the
                            surface.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_205" n="205" facs="0237"/>
                        <p>In other words we had decided on what our moves would be without any
                            request from the government of South Vietnam but only in anticipation of
                            such a request.</p>
                        <p>I have grave doubts about the ability of General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s government. I have no doubt
                            but that the great majority of the population of South Vietnam are tired
                            of the war and will give us no significant assistance. I have a full
                            awareness of your feelings, which I share, because of the attack on
                            Pleiku. I appreciate, too, your repeated statements that it is not your
                            desire to spread the war. However, the prospect for enlargement now
                            looms larger and I think it is only fair that I give you my honest
                            opinions, as I did on Saturday and Sunday, because to do otherwise would
                            be a disservice to you and to the Nation.</p>
                        <p>In this connection you will recall that I also stated at the meetings
                            that before we make any moves that we understand their full
                            implications, in terms of the costs involved, and the fact, as I see it,
                            that if we went too far in North Vietnam we would be in a far worse
                            position than we were in Korea.</p>
                        <p>For, in a larger sense, not only can we not depend on the South
                            Vietnamese population, but we can also place very little reliability on
                            the Laotians and the Thais and none whatever on Cambodia. Moreover,
                            beyond Indochina, we could well be squeezed in a nutcracker by
                            developing events throughout Southeast Asia over which the Chinese cast
                            an ominous shadow. Events in Malaysia could under certain circumstances
                            bring into force the Anzus Treaty which would call for our giving
                            assistance to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>Finally, as you know we have approximately 42 mutual security agreements
                            of one kind or another with countries or groups of countries scattered
                            over the face of the globe. Short of nuclear war, we have not got the
                            resources or the power to honor those agreements if the demand-payments
                            on them multiply. We are stretched too thin as it is and even with total
                            mobilization there would be little hope of fulfilling simultaneously any
                            large proportion of these commitments.</p>
                        <p>What the answer to the situation is at the moment I do not know nor does
                            anyone else. But I am persuaded that the trend toward enlargement of the
                            conflict and a continuous deepening of our military commitment on the
                            Asian mainland, despite your desire to the contrary, is not going to
                            provide one. I did suggest on Sunday, therefore, that the matter be
                            referred to the United Nations and I am glad that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> has brought it up at the
                            Security Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">For text of Ambassador

                            I did suggest further that the Geneva powers be convened again for the
                            purpose of seeing what if anything <pb xml:id="pg_206" n="206" facs="0238"/>honorably could be done. I did suggest that any other
                            forum might be considered in a search for acceptable ways to contract
                            and to end the fighting in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I further suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in Moscow could carry any or all of the above
                            suggestions to Brezhnev in Moscow and that our Ambassador in Warsaw, who
                            already has had in excess of 125 conferences with his Chinese Communist
                            counterpart, follow the same procedure.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to furnish you with a brief analysis of
                            my views in writing on this most difficult subject as I have expressed
                            them in large part in the meetings at the White House over the past
                            three days.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you will recall that I stated to you that the burden of decision
                            was yours but that, regardless of my individual views, I would do
                            whatever I could to support you in the exercise of your grave
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>2445. We appreciate prompt decisions from Washington for reprisal attacks
                            yesterday and today against selected military targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. I consider this a significant forward
                            step in demonstrating US determination not to continue to submit to
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offenses against US and Vietnamese
                            personnel and installations without a suitable response on our part. The
                            White House statement of February 7<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">For text,
                                see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 22, 1965, pp.
                                238–239.</note> emphasizes that we seek no wider war, in pinning the
                            responsibility on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and in
                            carefully pointing out that our response was against military targets
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression and not the
                            North Vietnamese population. This statement and our actions yesterday
                            and today provide in my view a good foundation for embarking on a
                            graduated reprisal program to bring increasing pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease its intervention in SVN, as
                            discussed here at some length with <persName>Bundy</persName> and his
                            party.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_207" n="207" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>The general concept of such a program is that through a measured,
                            controlled sequence of actions against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> taken in reprisal for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>-inspired actions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, significant pressures can be brought to bear on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to persuade it to stop its intervention
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The program would be carried out
                            jointly with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and would be directed
                            solely against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military targets and
                            infiltration routes, not against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            population. While February 7 and 8 military actions were specifically
                            tied to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks in Pleiku and Tuy Hoa,
                            in the future we could look to a situation in which US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reprisals could be initiated based on a
                            general catalog or package of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            outrages, no one particularly grave itself, not necessarily to a
                            specific <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> act in each case. For
                            example, we might announce that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> acts
                            against specific targets (such as the railroad in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>) will result in retaliation against
                            similar targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, our
                            graduated reprisals with the general level of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> outrages in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, or if
                            we so desired progressively raise the level of pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Thus, it would be tantamount to the
                            so-called Phase II escalation but justified on basis of retaliation.</p>
                        <p>In carrying out such a program, we believe that we should limit US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> publicity to the bare minimum necessary
                            to balance Communist output. We would confirm our reprisal actions only
                            when necessary and then as being in accordance with an established
                            policy of reprisals.</p>
                        <p>Our current 34A operations (except any 34–A air strikes in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) and the Yankee Team/Barrel Roll
                            operations in the Laos corridor would of course continue. Additionally,
                            we would progressively extend these operations into the DRV along
                            infiltration routes.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the period of graduated reprisals we would convey clearly
                            through appropriate intermediaries or other means to Peking, Moscow, and
                            Hanoi the limited nature of our objectives and intentions, but at the
                            same time our determination to achieve our objectives. Similarly, we
                            would have to expand our discussions with Thailand and initiate
                            discussions with the RLG and other friendly governments to bring them
                            into the picture to the extent desired.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> I would envisage
                            more detailed discussions at an early date to develop firm arrangements
                            for joint <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions and to begin a
                            process of education by which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            begin to formulate its war objectives and ultimately reach agreement
                            with US on the framework of demands to be made on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as well as the general negotiating
                            procedures. Both General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            and Acting Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName>
                            have stressed the need for expanded discussions and of integrating the
                            Vietnamese into a program against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. I
                            feel it is most important that we do this and that we maintain a sense
                            of momentum if we are to capitalize on the psychological factors which
                            if exploited early could lead to a greater sense of purpose and
                            direction both in the government and the military and awaken new hope
                            for eventual victory on the part of <pb xml:id="pg_208" n="208" facs="0240"/>the Vietnamese people. We should attempt to avoid in
                            the present situation a general letdown in morale and spirit which
                            followed our action in the Tonkin Gulf.</p>
                        <p>If the graduated reprisal program succeeds in mounting sufficient
                            pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to the point where
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders have serious doubts as

                            understanding of where we would like to come out. I believe rationale of
                            simply returning to observance of the spirit of the 1954 Geneva Accords
                            with respect to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and the 1962 accords

                            simplicity, of avoiding pitfalls of new conferences, and avoiding

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName>:</p>
                        <p>The President has asked me to respond to your long and thoughtful
                            memorandum of February 8<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">
                                <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> on the subject of
                            Vietnam. The President <pb xml:id="pg_209" n="209" facs="0241"/>feels
                            that your careful questions deserve a prompt reply, and as he himself is
                            heavily occupied today with other matters, he has asked me to answer in
                            his behalf.</p>
                        <p>Let me attempt to comment in order on the important points of your
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>1. We agree that the episode at Pleiku and our response to it create
                            pressures on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, but in our
                            judgment responsibility for this pressure rests with Hanoi and not with
                            us, and we believe that the Soviet Government will recognize this fact.
                            Given the character of the attack at Pleiku, we are unable to see what
                            other course was open to the President than to make an appropriate
                            reply. We think that inactivity by the United States would have made it
                            even more tempting for the Soviets to enlarge on their support for North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. Our intelligence estimators are clear in their judgment that it is
                            most unlikely that these events will have the effect of driving the
                            Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists closer together. Our Embassy in
                            Moscow points out that the Soviet statement contains at least two
                            elements which will be energetically disapproved by the Chinese
                            Communists: it speaks of the desire for good relations with the United
                            States, and it specifically limits its offer of assistance to defensive
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>3. In our efforts to defeat Communist aggression in Southeast Asia, we
                            must recognize that any U.S. action carries some risks of wider Chinese
                            involvement, but we aim to keep the risk of that involvement as low as
                            possible. As your memorandum generously recognizes, the President has
                            always emphasized his own desire to avoid actions which would lead to
                            direct conflict with the Chinese. We are making it clear in every
                            statement and by every avenue that our central concern in Vietnam is to
                            turn back the aggression in the South, and that our limited actions
                            against the North imply no intent whatever to “liberate” or conquer
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. We agree with you, of course, that there are important political
                            problems of governmental stability in South Vietnam, and that there is a
                            problem also in the degree to which the Communists have intimidated the
                            local population and made it reluctant to report Viet Cong movements. If
                            we had a stable government and if there were no fear of the Viet Cong,
                            we would not have the problem that we do in Vietnam. Unfortunately
                            stating the difficulties does not solve them, and it remains our best
                            judgment that the vast majority of the people of South Vietnam do not
                            wish to fall under Communist domination. The President has repeatedly
                            made it clear that we cannot ourselves solve all the problems of South
                            Vietnam. He has also insisted, however, that every possible step be
                            taken to make our support for the Vietnamese people more effective and
                            efficient. My own understanding of your position is that you agree with
                            this <pb xml:id="pg_210" n="210" facs="0242"/>course and do not wish to
                            see us pull out of Vietnam or decrease our present assistance to the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>5. The President certainly shares your view that military security should
                            be as effective as possible within the limits of our basic policy
                            decision not to deploy large American combat units for guard duty in
                            Vietnam. Able American professionals are giving their full attention to
                            the problem of military security around installations such as Bien Hoa
                            and Pleiku. The President is satisfied that General Westmoreland is an
                            outstanding officer, and I myself observed the energy with which he
                            followed up on the Pleiku incident. It remains true that in a contest as
                            fluid as this one, in which small units are able to move undetected
                            through large parts of the countryside, there can be no full guarantee
                            against episodes of this kind. As in all warfare, we learn as much by
                            experience as by forethought, and it was my observation that important
                            lessons had been learned in the Bien Hoa incident. Undoubtedly lessons
                            will be learned from Pleiku as well. The hazard of guerrilla attack will
                            nevertheless continue until the course of the struggle has been turned
                            strongly against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>6. I can assure you that the decision to make a retaliatory response was
                            in no sense unilateral. I talked myself with General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and I talked with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> just after his
                            conversation with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">For a record of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s
                                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> on
                                February 5, see <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s conversation with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> have not been
                                further identified.</note> From these conversations and from earlier
                            talks with Vietnamese leaders, I know they warmly support a policy of
                            response against outrages like that at Pleiku. This general attitude was
                            expressed to me by Vietnamese leaders from many different groups, and
                            indeed no different judgment was expressed by any of the Vietnamese
                            citizens with whom I talked during my visit.</p>
                        <p>7. We recognize the danger of war weariness among the population of South
                            Vietnam, but it seems to me wrong to conclude that the great majority of
                            the population will give us no significant assistance. The fact is that
                            while American losses come home with particular force to Americans, it
                            is the Vietnamese who are taking the bulk of the casualties. The
                            performance of Vietnamese armed units in recent months makes it clear
                            that they are tough and resilient fighters and that their morale remains
                            high. Moreover, when energetic programs of pacification are pursued, our
                            junior officers report that the population is invariably responsive. The
                            problem is one of maintaining the necessary energy and effectiveness,
                            not just sporadically but on a constantly growing basis throughout the
                            country. This task is certainly difficult, but I met no American in
                            Vietnam who thinks it impossible.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0243"/>
                        <p>8. You are certainly right to call attention to the wider environment of
                            Southeast Asia, but your judgment on some of the countries involved
                            seems harsh. We have had strong support from the Thais, for example,
                            especially with respect to Laos, which is necessarily of most direct
                            concern to them. Moreover, our own sea and air forces make us a most
                            formidable opponent, as long as we are careful and measured and
                            disciplined in our use of them.</p>
                        <p>9. More generally, it does not appear to me that the power of the United
                            States around the world is “stretched too thin.” We have been able to
                            keep our commitments around the world for a quarter of a century and our
                            country has never been richer or more at ease. While every single
                            American casualty gives the President personal sorrow, we cannot say
                            that the current level of American sacrifice in Southeast Asia is unduly
                            heavy. We made a vastly heavier sacrifice in Korea—and one which was
                            fully justified—and yet the stakes there were certainly not greater than
                            those that are now on the table in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>10. The President has considered your suggestion that we take the matter
                            to the United Nations. He regrets that previous discussions of the
                            question in the United Nations have not indicated any desire of the
                            members of that body to take any action whatever. From the Secretary
                            General on down, we are unable to find any expert on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who sees any prospect that it can act
                            effectively in the present situation in Vietnam. Neither is the
                            President aware of any prospect that any other conference or forum would
                            currently lead to an agreement by the Communists to end the fighting on
                            any terms other than those of surrender. But the President asked me to
                            say again how much he will value any further suggestions you may have on
                            this problem.</p>
                        <p>11. I think you know from our association in recent years how great is my
                            personal respect and regard for you, not only as the leader of the
                            majority in the Senate but also as one of the outstanding public
                            servants of our time. I therefore regret that your judgment and that of
                            the Administration should be at variance on this most important issue,
                            and I beg you to understand that while I have tried to write directly
                            and straightforwardly, I have done so with a feeling of deep respect not
                            only for you but for your deeply held convictions.</p>

                        <p>At approximately 8 a.m. (Saigon time) on February 10 the Viet Cong
                            detonated a bomb at a hotel in the coastal city of Qui Nhon being used
                            as a billet for U.S enlisted men. Twenty-three Americans were killed and
                            more than 20 wounded, the most American casualties incurred in a single
                            incident in the war to that point. In telegram 2491 from Saigon,
                            February 10, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> reported
                            that he, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> had concluded
                            that the attack on the Qui Nhon was “a serious <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> atrocity” justifying a prompt air reprisal, which they
                            recommended. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–8 VIET S) For <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s recollection of the

                        <p>At 11:30 I saw the President. We were alone for the most fascinating hour
                            and a quarter I ever spent in Government. I came prepared to propound
                            certain views, in accordance with a sketchy agenda he had requested. I
                            never got to first base, for I was tagged out as soon as I started to
                            run.</p>
                        <p>I expected to give him a review of political, economic, and financial
                            affairs in Great Britain; advance ideas on how to keep ANF-<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> negotiations going in a low key;
                            suggest he have a talk with Jean Monnet; speak about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>; and oppose a possible invitation to Sukarno to
                            visit the United States. I did have a chance, during the morning, to
                            speak to the last item; the President said he had no intention of
                            inviting Sukarno, he had merely sounded out the British on the
                            suggestion. We had, also, some conversation on the Congo, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, arms to Jordan and Jewish
                            objections thereto.</p>
                        <p>He started off by telling me, in considerable detail, of his plans for
                            retaliation against the North Vietnamese. I confessed my ignorance of
                                <pb xml:id="pg_213" n="213" facs="0245"/>the area, but he insisted
                            on my expressing an opinion on certain contingencies. I told him I hoped
                            American ground troops would not be used in North Vietnam in the absence
                            of massive attack by Chinese soldiers; but that we would be able to
                            attain our objectives by air strikes. He said that General <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>, when the President visited
                            him a day before his death,<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> died April 5,
                                1964.</note> had passionately warned him against the use of American
                            ground troops in Asia.</p>
                        <p>I have the impression that the President, so adept in the use of power in
                            domestic politics, has been considering carefully how to exercise it in
                            international affairs, and has reached certain conclusions that will be
                            manifested in forthcoming decisions. He bitterly resents indignities
                            against our establishments and officials abroad, such as burning of
                            libraries, stoning of Embassies, and the rest. I think we may expect
                            stern responses in the future to such actions.</p>
                        <p>After some conversation about his badly needed and imaginative programme
                            to “make America beautiful,” he reverted to Vietnam; he displayed a
                            thorough familiarity with the types and numbers of planes operated by
                            both sides there, the strength of guerrillas, rangers, partisans and
                            regulars thus far engaged. During all our talk today, from time to time
                            he made calls through the telephone switchboard in front of his chair.
                            Once it was to tell the Pentagon to shift a squadron of aircraft nearer
                            Vietnam, others to inform Senators Dirksen and <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> what instructions he had
                            lately sent to Saigon, another to State approving a severe rebuke to the
                            Kremlin regarding the attack on our Moscow Embassy,<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">On February 9 a demonstration involving more than

                                U.S. bombing raids on North Vietnam. The demonstrators hurled stones
                                and other objects at the Embassy building, breaking more than 200

                        <p>1. Should we retaliate?—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            thought we should with a joint US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            operation;</p>
                        <p>2. When should we retaliate?—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt strongly that this should be done at the
                            first daylight opportunity;</p>
                        <p>3. Against what targets?—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            recommended three targets: two just north of the 17th parallel
                            (barracks), and one 50 miles north (supply base).</p>
                        <p>4. What should be the rationale for retaliation?—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt we should point to the
                            recent terror against South Vietnamese civilians, including the blowing
                            up of a railroad bridge, and the blowing up of the barracks.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_215" n="215" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>Much of the rest of the discussion centered on the timing and composition
                            of the attack. State (especially <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>) and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> felt that we should hold up the attack until
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had returned to
                            Moscow, or, in any case, until after he left Peiping following his visit
                            to North Korea. The argument centered on the effect of an immediate
                            attack on Sino-Soviet relations and the degree of commitment the Soviets
                            might be forced to make. State felt that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s trip to North Korea was an affront to the
                            Chinese and that an immediate attack would submerge or paper-over the
                            difficulties that the Chinese and Russians would otherwise confront when
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> saw the Chinese on
                            his way back to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>If a retaliatory strike were to be launched immediately, State felt that
                            it should be a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rather than a U.S.
                            effort. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and most of
                            the others present, felt that the President would be hard-pressed to
                            explain to the American people why U.S. planes did not retaliate
                            immediately, especially in the light of our reprisal against the Pleiku
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing the merit of this, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized that the biggest single question we
                            confronted was how to avoid a substantial Soviet commitment to North
                            Vietnam. Such a commitment might be postponed or minimized if we could
                            delay our reprisal, or if the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>
                            alone made an immediate reprisal.</p>
                        <p>Most of the participants discounted the effectiveness of a <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> attack. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> attack had hit the wrong target the night before and,
                            in any case, the difference between a <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strike and one which would involve U.S. planes would
                            not make a significant difference in terms of the Soviet reaction. This
                            phase of the meeting ended with several people, including <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and the Vice President, musing
                            on the merits of delaying the retaliation for a few days, not only
                            because of the Sino-Soviet matter but because of the remaining
                            dependents.</p>
                        <p>The President joined the group at approximately two o'clock, at which
                            time the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting began (to be

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> summarized for
                            the President the latest information on the Viet Cong bombing of the
                            enlisted men's barracks at Qui Nhon. As of that time, one U.S. soldier
                            was known to be dead, 20 injured, and 20 missing. Presumably, the
                            missing soldiers are buried under the rubble of the billet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> summarized the
                            discussion of the Council members prior to the President's arrival. A
                            response to the Qui Nhon incident by the U.S. in some form is agreed by
                            all present. However, there is a difference as to what the response
                            should be. Some believe we should not launch another raid while
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is in the Far East.
                            Some feel an attack now might force the Chinese Communists and the
                            Soviet Union together.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported
                            that the Soviet reaction to the earlier attack on North Vietnam had so
                            far been mild. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is
                            leaving for North Korea at 3:00 p.m. today our time. He will probably
                            try to enlist the support of the North Koreans for the holding of the
                            March 1 meeting of Communist Parties which the Soviets are planning
                            despite Chinese Communist opposition. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is expected to stay two days in North Korea.
                            U.S. action now puts heavy pressure on the Soviets. We should hold off
                            any reprisal action until <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            leaves the area. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> added that our objective should be to avoid any
                            deeper Soviet commitment to the North Vietnamese. If the Chinese
                            Communist Air Force comes in response to our retaliatory attack, very
                            heavy pressure is put on the Soviets to come to the aid of the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName> said he did not
                            believe the Russians would make a major policy decision based on the
                            whereabouts of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> pointed out
                            that we cannot put ourself in the position of giving the Russians
                            control over our actions by their moving <pb xml:id="pg_217" n="217" facs="0249"/>Soviet diplomats from one place to another. If we take
                            no action, the Soviets may think we are in fact a paper tiger.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said that to base
                            our action on a possible Soviet reaction would be to lose sight of our
                            objective which is to help the South Vietnamese overcome aggression.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, the Joint
                            Chiefs and the Department of Defense recommended a retaliatory strike
                            today at daylight. He said we will soon be facing the difficulty of
                            taking Phase II actions even though there are no incidents created by
                            the Viet Cong. However, the Qui Nhon attack provides us an opportunity
                            today to retaliate immediately. He explained to the President the
                            targets in North Vietnam which could be hit today. They are: Target 14,
                            the Thanh Hoa bridge, which he said he would discuss later; Target 24,
                            the Chanh Hoa army barracks, and Target No. 53, the Phu Vam supply
                            depot, as a weather alternative. In addition to these two U.S. targets,
                            he recommended that Target No. 32, the Vu Con barracks, be struck by the
                            Vietnamese Air Force, assisted by U.S. planes with Target No. 39, the
                            Chap Le barracks, as a weather alternative. (See attached target map
                            with descriptions.) (Tab B)<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">Attached, but not

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said that at an
                            appropriate time we could publicly announce that we had turned a corner
                            and changed our policy but that no mention should be made now of such a
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed the importance of preventing any leaks to
                            newspapers. He appealed to the patriotism of those present and asked the
                            Heads of Departments and Agencies present to survey their departments to
                            ensure that leaks were not coming from their subordinates.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, the Acting Chairman of the Joint
                            Chiefs, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName>, said
                            he agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s recommendation. From a military point of view
                            there is no reason to delay a strike.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what our team in Saigon recommended. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> read parts of a
                            message from General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> recommending (Tab C) immediate reprisals.
                            (Copy attached)<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">Not found as an attachment to
                                the source text.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> said that, having talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recently, he could summarize
                            his views as follows: Reprisals should be undertaken at once, not only
                            to improve morale in South Vietnam but also to give a clear signal to
                            the North Vietnamese. He would not think that Communist behavior would
                            be basically changed if we decided to delay a U.S. strike.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
                            United States has overwhelming air power in the Southeast Asia area. The
                            Joint Chiefs do not want to add <pb xml:id="pg_218" n="218" facs="0250"/>more military power to that already in the Western Pacific. However,
                            he thought that we should move additional forces into the Southeast Asia
                            area for political reasons. He suggested that rather than announce the
                            movement of these forces into the area we could informally give the
                            press the list of U.S. forces which would have been placed on alert for
                            short notice movement to the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said about 130 planes would
                            be used in the strike recommended for approval. He then said he would
                            drop Target 14, the Thanh Hoa bridge, which is much further north than
                            any of the other targets. He suggested that Target No. 53, the Phu Van
                            Support Depot be put in the plan instead of the prestige bridge
                            recommended earlier. He felt that three targets were needed, two for the
                            United States and one for the Vietnamese Air Force to attack. In
                            response to question, he said the targets were not related to the
                            railroad system because damage done to railroad tracks could be easily
                            repaired.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that
                            today's retaliatory strike be limited to two targets.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to ask whether any casualties had been reported
                            as a result of the earlier strike. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> replied that Hanoi had given no casualty
                            figures but merely admitted there had been a loss of life.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion as to whether the last raid by the South
                                Vietnamese<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">The raid on February 8 on the
                                Chap Le Army Barracks. A report on the raid was contained in a
                                February 8 memorandum to the President from the White House
                                Situation Room. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country
                                File, Vietnam, Vol. XXVIII, Cables)</note> had been successful.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported that
                            after-battle information revealed that the South Vietnamese planes had
                            hit a target other than one they were supposed to hit.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether all those present agreed we should launch a
                            retaliatory strike.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's direct question, the Vice President said
                            he had some doubts as to whether the strike should take place today or
                            whether it should be delayed until Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> left the area. He had mixed feelings about
                            whether we should retaliate as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had recommended. He shared the State
                            Department's view that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            presence in Hanoi or in the Far East limited our freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> repeated his
                            view that our action should be cautious. He said the strike as now
                            planned, i.e., deleting the Thanh Hoa Bridge, minimized the effect on a
                            possible Soviet reaction to the strike.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_219" n="219" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> recommended
                            that the strike be delayed for a few days. He thought we should first
                            give warning that the North Vietnamese must stop their aggressive action
                            now or we would end the safe haven which they now have in North Vietnam.
                            If they then continue their activities we should launch Phase II of our
                            December plan for graduated military pressures.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The President suggested we discuss our position with the Soviet
                            Ambassador, possibly sending a message to the Soviet officials as to why
                            we have to react the way we are. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> yesterday a “personal” message from the Soviet
                            Government which had a governmental rather than a personal tone.<note n="7" xml:id="d98fn7">See <ref target="#d82fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        </p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we had any other channels of communication.
                            He recalled the Seaborn channel. He was reminded of the conversations
                            which are apparently being carried on informally by the French in
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of how much news should be made public
                            following the air attack. The consensus was that we should not spell out
                            in detail exactly what we had undertaken to do.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the question as to whether there should be
                            Congressional consultation. He also asked whether the time had come for
                            him to make a TV speech. He indicated his reluctance to state again what
                            he had said many times previously.</p>
                        <p>The President then expressed an interest in any possible targets in South
                            Vietnam. In response, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there were no worthwhile targets they had
                            been able to find in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we must
                            emphasize South Vietnam's participation in the air attacks. Selecting
                            only two targets, one for U.S. forces and one for South Vietnamese
                            forces, meant that the operation would be smaller than previously
                            planned. The two targets chosen were closer to the demarcation line and
                            thus an attack on them would be less likely to pull in the MIG airplanes
                            based in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President said it had been proper and necessary for us to go into
                            great detail publicly about our first raid in order to reassure the
                            press but he did not think it is necessary following the proposed
                            strike. Public statements should be limited to a generalized description
                            of the new strike.</p>

                        <p>The President received affirmative answers when he asked Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>, and Director <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> whether they agreed with the
                            recommended strike plan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName> said he thought the strike should be made to meet
                            domestic public opinion requirements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> summarized the
                            consensus that news of the new strike should be released Thursday<note n="8" xml:id="d98fn8">February 11.</note> in Saigon and that special
                            emphasis should be given to the joint U.S.-South Vietnamese character of
                            the action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then proposed
                            that the strike be limited to two targets and that the justification for
                            the strike would be a public statement separate from a report of the
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The President authorized execution of the strike plan as revised. (The

                            reported events in South Vietnam including the bombing of the enlisted

                        </p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then raised the
                            question:</p>
                        <p>a. Should we retaliate?</p>
                        <p>b. When?</p>
                        <p>c. What targets?</p>
                        <p>His recommendation was immediate retaliation on specified targets,
                            including a bridge (Target 14) within 75 miles of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> took exception to
                            timing. He and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> placed
                            great importance on the presence of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in the Far East. He felt that action by us
                            during <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s stay would
                            prompt a greater Soviet reaction than would be the case if we waited
                            until <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> returned to Moscow.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> supported this view;
                            he laid particular emphasis on the visit of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to North Korea, stating that this would widen
                            the Sino-Soviet schism; furthermore he noted the complications and the
                            competition between the Soviets and the ChiCom over the forthcoming
                            March 1st meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">See <ref target="#d55">paragraph 8, Document 55</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, or more particularly
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, seemed anxious to
                            tamp down any reaction on our part, deferring it at least until
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s return to Moscow,
                            and very possibly until March 1st.</p>
                        <p>3. The Vice President expressed support of the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> position. He also made the point that the South
                            Vietnamese have to fight. He raised the question as to whether the South
                            Vietnamese should not conduct these attacks, rather than the Americans.
                            He questioned why the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> police state
                            was so good and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in such turmoil and
                            ineffective. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that
                            even in a “South Vietnamese attack,” U.S. planes provide the cover, flak
                            suppression and the navigation. Therefore, there is a presence of half
                            or more U.S. planes in a <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> strike.</p>
                        <p>4. I expressed and advocated very strongly an immediate U.S./<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> strike of substantial proportions and
                            urged that this be done promptly. I took issue with the arguments that
                            we should defer action because of the Sino-Soviet split, the March 1st
                            meeting and the totality of the political relationship between the
                            Soviet Union and the United States. I stated that the Sino-Soviet split,
                            the issues and depths of the quarrel, was not wholly understood by us;
                            that I did not think our actions would necessarily control it or its
                            depth. Moreover, the March 1st meeting was an uncertainty and I did not
                            think our actions would have a great deal of bearing on it. I said we
                            must not lose sight of our purpose, which was to help South Vietnamese
                            win freedom from Communist aggression and this could only be done by
                            dynamic and positive action on our part which should not be <pb xml:id="pg_222" n="222" facs="0254"/>compromised for collateral
                            reasons. I pointed out the attack of Monday<note n="6" xml:id="d99fn6">February 8.</note> had already had salutary effects on the
                            political situation in Saigon and that if we did not move in this
                            instance, there would be serious disappointment and disillusionment. I
                            therefore urged not only prompt retaliation but a program of sustained
                            action against the North, selecting targets in the southern part of
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, and predicted that this would
                            cause Hanoi to reappraise and very probably modify their <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            support policies.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> exchanged views on whether we had turned
                            the corner and had moved in the direction of sustained and repeated
                            strikes, rather than occasional retaliations. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> took the view that
                            retaliation was for all the actions of the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the South and not
                            for any single specific VC operation; therefore we should keep
                            going.</p>
                        <p>6. The President asked [for] the field recommendations. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> read the latest cable which
                            supported his earlier recommendations. The President asked the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>—Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said there was unanimity that we should go
                            right now.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Carl
                                Rowan</persName>, all expressed support of immediate action, with
                            statements concerning how it should be kept in a low key, announced out
                            of Saigon, etc., etc.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> then suggested that we
                            might defer action for a few days but announce that we were going to
                            take retaliatory moves at a time of our choosing. This would permit
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to get out of the Far
                            East. This idea was vetoed. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> then suggested we work out communications to
                            Hanoi, Peiping and Moscow concerning our purposes and see if they were
                            not prepared to modify their tactics. It was agreed that we should keep
                            open channels, which would probably be meaningless, as discussions would
                            be on their terms, not ours.</p>
                        <p>9. The President then raised the question of VC targets in South Vietnam.
                            He seemed to feel that with all the Viet Cong and their irregulars,
                            totaling in excess of 100,000, there should be some lucrative camps as
                            targets. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> explained that
                            there weren't.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> than raised the question
                            of what would happen when the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s came
                            in. He developed a scenario of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>
                            opposition, followed by the need to take out the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> bases in North Vietnam. This then would be followed by
                            ChiComs introducing <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s from bases
                            across the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> border; then this would
                            escalate into the necessity to take out those bases. Hence, he could see
                            we were starting on a course that would escalate into all-out conflict
                            with China.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_223" n="223" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>11. The question of China participation was raised. I stated that there
                            was a possibility of Chinese volunteers coming in at any time and a
                            capability to introduce them. They might do so. However, we did not
                            believe they would introduce organized units now. At this point I said
                            that the introduction of Chinese at this point was not considered a
                            probable event, however, it was very definitely a possibility and in the
                            consideration of our actions, we had to plan to take care of every
                            single possibility, irrespective of how remote, and to be prepared to
                            commit the forces, the resources, the money, etc., to this end. The
                            President was in agreement with this point. Note: This was a repetition
                            of what I had told him privately a week ago.<note n="7" xml:id="d99fn7">See <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. The President then raised the question of how we can prove that the
                            support and direction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> was
                            coming from Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> quickly responded that
                            this could be proven in the most positive and undeniable way and that
                            State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> were working on
                            papers which would convince even the most doubting people that this was
                                true.<note n="8" xml:id="d99fn8">See <ref target="#d171">Document
                                    171</ref>.</note> (I did not enter into this discussion as I am
                            not familiar with this effort, and I am not sure that the case can be
                            undeniably proven, although I am convinced that this whole operation is
                            directed out of Hanoi.) (Carter follow this up.)</p>
                        <p>13. The President then invited a general discussion of the protection of
                            our bases. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> repeated his
                            position that it is impossible. It would take at least 100,000 men, 44
                            battalions, and the presence of such large forces in South Vietnam would
                            be unacceptable for a variety of reasons. (I did not engage in this
                            discussion as I don't believe this to be the case. I think that we can,
                            and must, figure out some way to protect our bases and believe that a
                            net of clandestine operations can be created by the intelligence
                            community which would serve as “Paul Revere's” to furnish warning.
                                (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> follow this up.)</p>
                        <p>14. Finally, there was a general agreement that the strike should take
                            place at first light or as soon as command in the field could organize
                            the operation. The Target 14 bridge was withdrawn, also the strike
                            should be conducted by both the South Vietnamese and the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concurred, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> continued his reservations,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> interposed no
                            objection.</p>
                        <p>15. Following this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DDC1">Dillon</persName>, and I remained to work out a press release.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that the President had “turned the
                            corner” and we were on the track of sustained and continuing operations
                            against the North. I said this was a change from Monday, because I got
                            the impression on Monday that he was approving a retaliation for a
                            particular event. All in the room, and most particularly <pb xml:id="pg_224" n="224" facs="0256"/>Dillon, stated that I had
                            misunderstood the President's decision, that he did indeed turn the
                            corner on Monday, and that a program of sustained operations, which was
                            in effect the carrying out of “Phase II” was the order of the day.
                            Despite this, I continue to feel that we are operating consciously or
                            unconsciously on a “reprisal basis” and that if we were to run into a
                            period of a lull for two weeks or three weeks in which no serious
                            atrocities were conducted by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, our
                            operations against the North would be automatically stood down. Despite
                            all protestations to the contrary, I think this the frame of mind of
                            State and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>. It is
                            my opinion that the only advocates of sustained phase of operations are
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara, and myself. (Note my telephone
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on
                                2/11.)<note n="9" xml:id="d99fn9">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>16. At 6:15 we met in the President's lounge on the second floor of the
                            Mansion with the Leadership and Principal Committee Chairmen, in
                            addition to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MCJW1">McCormack</persName>, and other leaders, Rivers
                            and George Mahon, the President, the Vice President, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>.<note n="10" xml:id="d99fn10">See <ref target="#d100">Document 100 for another record of this
                                    meeting</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>17. The President opened the meeting by explaining the serious difficult
                            situation that confronted us. He called on <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to give the details. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> repeated the reports from the
                            field. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then expressed his
                            views concerning the complications of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s presence in the Far East. The President then
                            stated that the decision has been made to conduct the strikes. He asked
                            me for an opinion of Soviet-Chinese Communist reactions. I said that in
                            all probability there would be no Chinese Communist reaction to these
                            strikes, although there was a possibility of the introduction of ChiCom
                            volunteers into Laos and North Vietnam. I did not think the ChiComs
                            would come in in organized units. With respect to the Soviets, I felt
                            that they would probably increase their supplies of defense material and
                            armament for use by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgents, but I
                            did not expect any military action, nor did I support the possibility of
                            confrontation with us in other areas, i.e., Berlin and Cuba, etc.</p>
                        <p>18. <persName>Bundy</persName> then reviewed at some length his
                            observations in South Vietnam, dealing with the political situation.</p>
                        <p>19. The President then went around the room and there was no objection to
                            the courses of action decided upon. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, who was present, made no comment whatsoever.
                            The President pointedly avoided asking him for an opinion or for
                            comment. The meeting adjourned about 8:15.</p>
                        <p>20. Note: Throughout this discussion the emphasis was laid on retaliation
                            and reprisal for the events which had been described by <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. <pb xml:id="pg_225" n="225" facs="0257"/>There was no intimation given that we were engulfed on
                            a program of sustained and continuing strikes against the north.</p>
                        <p>21. Following the meeting I had a brief private discussion with the
                            President and told him I was going to leave for the south and would be
                            there for a few days to get over this cold, would be available to call,
                            would keep a plane standing by. The President agreed this should be
                            done, saw no immediate crisis requiring my staying on hand. I told him
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CLGMS1">Carter</persName> would be
                            acting.</p>

                        <p>The President called upon <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                                Ball</persName>, in the absence of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean

                                Bundy</persName> to comment briefly and concisely on the problem
                            currently. He called on Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> to comment on the military aspect of the
                            problem currently. He solicited views and opened the meeting to
                            questions. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Kuchel</persName>
                            questioned <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> briefly
                            by way of clarification of <persName>Bundy</persName>'s remarks—was
                            nothing unusual, was rather routine. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> engaged in a discussion that involved
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in which he questioned <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on the feasibility of any
                            retaliatory attack or any kind of military action involving the mainland
                            of China. This was…dismissed out of hand. <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> prefaced his question by saying “I'm going to
                            ask what I'm sure will be considered a foolish question,” and that was
                            the only spot during the meeting where there was anything in the way of
                            vigorous exchange of views because the President's advisers answered
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> directly and
                            completely and objected to any consideration such as he envisioned. The
                            President in turn asked the…oh, Mendel Rivers posed questions to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> on the military
                            action phase of the problem and asked him for some specifics…hardware
                            and procedures that he felt that could or would be followed militarily.

                            be a pursuit of a subject that had been taken up between the two of them
                            at a prior date. The Speaker commented very briefly by way of stating
                            that the President and his advisors were following the right course and
                            the only course. Carl Albert, <persName corresp="#p_SGA1">George
                                Smathers</persName>, and George Mahon were asked if they cared to
                            comment. They declined. The Vice President made a brief comment along
                            the same lines as the Speaker's comment. Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> was asked if he cared to
                            comment. He declined to comment. He had a memo that was in his hand—I
                            sat next to him, and I thought he would comment off the memo, but he
                            apparently decided at the last second not to bring the memo into
                            discussion at the meeting so he placed it in an envelope and gave it to
                            Jack Valenti for direct delivery to the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">See <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note>
                            The President urged the group to avoid any discussion of the meeting,
                            and that if it was learned that a meeting took place, they would have to
                            limit themselves to simply saying it was an informal group of leaders
                            gathered to hear a report from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge

                            memorandum of February 8th<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">
                                <ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> which I advanced at the
                            earlier National Security Council meetings<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">See <ref target="#d76">Documents 76</ref>, <ref target="#d77">77</ref>, and <ref target="#d80">80</ref>.</note> and which
                            remain unchanged. They are directed specifically at the second major
                            Viet Cong attack.</p>
                        <p>(1) Anticipate that the Communist defenses against air attacks in the
                            North have already been and will continue to be strengthened since the
                            last attack.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>(2) Anticipate that another retaliation on our part now will not cool off
                            the situation—that much should now be clear. Rather it is likely to lead
                            to a further Viet Cong response in South Viet Nam. Therefore, it would
                            be unwise to undertake any retaliation without the full expectation of
                            the response.</p>
                        <p>(3) Anticipate, further, that the next Viet Cong retaliation is not going
                            to be to fly Migs into Hawk missiles—that would be pitting their
                            weakness against our strength. They are not fools and they are not going
                            to play the game as fools. They are going to continue to play their
                            strength against our weakness. Our weakness is on the ground in Viet
                            Nam, where isolated pockets of Americans are surrounded by, at best, an
                            indifferent population and, more likely, by an increasingly hostile
                            population.</p>
                        <p>(4) Anticipate that we can count on the South Vietnamese people for less,
                            rather than more, help as the tit-for-tat pattern develops. In a matter
                            of weeks or months it will become unlikely that any of the present
                            United States installations outside of Saigon will be really secure
                            against the Viet Cong. If we are to minimize repetitions of the recent
                            American bloodlettings, therefore, the outposts will have to be vastly
                            strengthened by American forces or pulled into and consolidated in the
                            Saigon area. The timing of any further retaliation against the North, if
                            that is the decision, should take cognizance of this factor.</p>
                        <p>The French government has indicated that it would participate in a
                            conference of the 1954 Geneva conferees if it should be called by the
                            United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, the sponsoring powers. We are not
                            members of the 1954 Conference (although we were represented there by an
                            observer) and we should certainly interpose no objections to its being
                            called. Indeed if there is to be another retaliation against the North
                            in response to this latest incident, it may be well to try to make it
                            serve the purpose of bringing about the reconvening of such a
                            Conference. If it is convened, our diplomacy should strive to see to it
                            that the first act of this Conference should be to call for a cease-fire
                            throughout Viet Nam and Indochina. We could then attend the Conference,
                            if we chose, as observers or as participants depending on an assessment
                            of both the military and diplomatic situation at the time.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In reflecting on Mac's report and its Annex,<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">
                                <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> I am troubled by some
                            far-reaching questions. Let me be clear that I am not questioning the
                            need for a response to “spectaculars” like Pleiku: my doubts focus on
                            the suggested policy of systematic and continuous reprisals against the
                            North.</p>
                        <p>1. Have we faced—and has the President faced—the full shape of the risk
                            of Chinese intervention?</p>
                        <p>As I read them, the estimates<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">See the section
                                entitled “What Are The Risks?” in <ref target="#d90">Document
                                    90</ref>.</note> already point to the probability of a Chinese
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> response to U.S. air attacks
                            north of the 19th parallel. Under present <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> rules of engagement our planes are authorized hot
                            pursuit across the Chinese border to the jet bases in South China and
                            suppressive fire against these bases. (The estimates also deem as likely
                            Chinese use of these bases.) Such strikes in South China would very
                            probably bring Chinese ground forces into Southeast Asia. Needless to
                            say, any strikes against Chinese nuclear centers—if perchance such a
                            side-benefit is lurking in anyone's mind—would unquestionably bring a
                            Chinese ground force response.</p>
                        <p>2. This raises a further question: Are we willing—and is the President
                            willing—to face a ground war in Southeast Asia against the combined
                            armies of North Vietnam and China?</p>
                        <p>This is an old question I know, but it is one that must be faced anew in
                            terms of the systematic reprisal track. It would be folly for the sheer
                            momentum of events (or of actions taken to bolster the morale of our
                            friends in Saigon) to lead us into a land war with China in which our
                            air and naval power would be relatively ineffective.</p>
                        <p>3. Perhaps more significantly, are the American people willing to face a
                            ground war in Vietnam—a conflict already fuzzed by national doubts far
                            exceeding any that attached to the relatively clear-cut Korean conflict
                            (invasion and “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>” response)?</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, what has happened to the concept of “negotiation” so
                            earnestly pursued by our more thoughtful journalistic and Congressional
                                <pb xml:id="pg_229" n="229" facs="0261"/>critics, and previously
                            pursued by many thoughtful people here and at State? Are we ruling it
                            out, as the Annex suggests? If so, for how long?</p>
                        <p>In sum, I fear we must very soon face the fundamental question of whether
                            the kind of South Vietnam we would like to see emerge is really worth
                            the high probability of a land war with China, a war in which Soviet
                            neutrality simply cannot be assumed.</p>
                        <p>I know that these are not new questions; but I would feel utterly
                            negligent if I did not raise them again at this time. It is instructive
                            to remember that the bright promise of our predecessor Administration
                            was early removed by a combination of accumulated momentum and events
                            that led us into the first Cuban episode. I know that Cuba was not worth
                            that price at the time; and I seriously question the higher price we may
                            be forced to pay for Vietnam in Asia and in our relations with most of
                            the rest of the world over the next decade.</p>

                        <p>1. The Prime Minister placed the call to the President to propose that he
                            should visit Washington immediately for discussion of the crisis in
                            Viet-Nam. I had already informed the British Ambassador, first on my own
                            and then later at the President's direct insistence, that such a visit
                            would be untimely and unhelpful. <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord

                            that the Prime Minister was insistent. I tried a further delay by
                            suggesting that the call be deferred until Thursday a.m.,<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">February 11.</note> but the Prime Minister
                            continued to insist that he needed to have a position <pb xml:id="pg_230" n="230" facs="0262"/>before he faced his own Cabinet
                            Thursday noon London time. The President agreed to receive the call and,
                            after considerable delay in a vain effort to get the classified circuit
                            going, I completed an open circuit with the Prime Minister, and the
                            President went on the line about 10:15 p.m. My notes cover only the
                            President's side of the conversation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister evidently opened with his proposal, and apparently
                            indicated that there was a high level of concern in London, and that he
                            would like to come to Washington to put himself in a better position to
                            deal with that concern.</p>
                        <p>3. The President said he thought it would be a very serious mistake for
                            the Prime Minister to come over; that he thought there was nothing to
                            get upset about, any more than it would be right for him to get upset
                            about Malaysia; and that any visit would be misunderstood here. The
                            President said that our response had been very measured and very
                            reasonable, and that it was not going to be very different whether the
                            Prime Minister came here or not—that it would be a great mistake for us
                            to jump up and down and fly the Atlantic every time there was an issue
                            of this sort. Next week we might be arguing about Sukarno, and another
                            week there might be a threat or two from some Communist. We have
                            telephones and we can always talk.</p>
                        <p>4. The President went on to make the point that he had tried to be
                            helpful to the Prime Minister on monetary matters and on Malaysia, and
                            that he would be glad to send the Prime Minister an account of the exact
                            situation by classified cable so that he could tell his colleagues just
                            what the U.S. position was.</p>
                        <p>5. The Prime Minister then evidently said something about his problems in
                            the House of Commons. The President said he had plenty of problems with
                            his own Congress, and he thought it would be a mistake for the Prime
                            Minister to try to use the President as an instrument in the House of
                            Commons, just as he would not wish to use the Prime Minister as an
                            instrument with the Congress. He had to deal with the Congress every
                            day, but he did not pull the Prime Minister into it. He thought the
                            Prime Minister would have to decide what side he was on. The Prime
                            Minister evidently said something about the hazards of escalation, and
                            the President replied he was afraid of escalation, too, but he did not
                            see what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our
                            coattails out. He thought that such activity would make everybody even
                            more concerned and, instead, he proposed again that he should send the
                            Prime Minister an exact account of the situation and he would be glad to
                            have the Prime Minister's comments as a true ally.</p>
                        <p>6. The President reminded the Prime Minister that the U.S. did not have
                            the company of many allies in Vietnam. He had spoken to the Prime
                            Minister about the need for British support there and the Prime Minister
                            had told him about his troubles in other areas. The President told the
                                <pb xml:id="pg_231" n="231" facs="0263"/>Prime Minister that he was
                            with him in Malaysia with men, money, marbles, and chalk, all the way.
                            Now in Vietnam it looks a little dark and he didn't see what help would
                            come from talk. If the Prime Minister had any men to spare, he would be
                            glad to have them. The Prime Minister apparently returned to the charge,
                            and the President asked him bluntly, “Why don't you run Malaysia and let
                            me run Vietnam?” Would the Prime Minister think it would be good for the
                            President to announce to the American press tomorrow that he was going
                            over to London to try to stop the British in Malaysia? The Prime
                            Minister apparently answered back in some fashion, and the President
                            repeated his comments about the British in Malaysia and our own role in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>7. At this point the Prime Minister apparently gave way and reassured the
                            President of his own basic support for our policy in Vietnam. The
                            President replied that that was all right and fine—that we would stand
                            on that—that we understood the British problem—the monetary problem, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> problem, too. [Here follows
                            discussion of the multilateral force.]</p>
                        <p>8. The conversation evidently moved back to Vietnam. The President said
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> was here,
                            and that he had talked with him for two hours today<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">See <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>.</note>
                            and he would be seeing him further. He would have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> bring a detailed memorandum on
                            the exact situation to the Prime Minister.<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">No copy of such a memorandum has been found, nor is there any
                                indication in <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>'s Diary
                                that he was given such a memorandum for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>.</note> The President
                            repeated that he would be glad to share all this information with the
                            Prime Minister and if the Prime Minister had any troops to spare, the
                            President would be glad to have them.</p>
                        <p>9. The President reaffirmed his basic position: Wherever they murder our
                            people, we are going to react promptly, adequately, and measuredly. The
                            President knew the Prime Minister was going to do the same thing—in
                            Malaysia or anywhere else.</p>
                        <p>10. The Prime Minister then apparently spoke about the concerns of some
                            other countries. The President replied that he had never considered any
                            of these countries great allies. France was a problem to us, and India
                            had never taken up arms for us. I passed the President a note that our
                            information was that the Indians wanted us to stand firm. The President
                            repeated this comment to the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>11. The Prime Minister then apparently gave further assurances. The
                            President said that he was glad to hear of them, and repeated his view
                            that we ought not to run back and forth across the Atlantic with our
                            shirttails hanging out.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_232" n="232" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>12. The Prime Minister then apparently said something about the
                            difficulty he would have in explaining what he was doing and not doing,
                            and all that he would have to talk about was a call in the middle of the
                            night. The President replied with some sharpness that it was the Prime
                            Minister and not he who placed the call in the middle of the night. The
                            President was just answering it. The President then repeated that the
                            U.S. position was not provocative, not belligerent, not domineering, and
                            that we were not throwing our weight around. But if people came in and
                            killed our men—20 or 30 or 40 of them—our response would be prompt,
                            adequate, and measured. And that's what the President would expect the
                            Prime Minister to do in similar circumstances, and he would have our
                            full support.</p>
                        <p>13. At this point the Prime Minister apparently gave new assurances of
                            his support and friendship, and the President said that that was fine,
                            and he appreciated it, and that was friendship, and that was the way it
                            ought to be—and he reciprocated.</p>
                        <p>14. There was then some further talk about what could be said about being
                            in communication, and the President said he surely would keep in touch.
                            The conversation then came to an end, and the President instructed me to
                            send off a message summarizing the current situation to the Prime
                            Minister's office. This I later did.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Telegram <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 65037 to Wright of the

                            attacks. (It will be most important to assure that these terms be
                            communicated accurately and fully to Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow.)</p>
                        <p>The following comprises in broad outline our tentative thinking on how
                            these terms for cessation of our reprisal attacks might be stated. They
                            are implicit in and should be considered in conjunction with Embtel 2235
                            but are restated in this form for convenience of the Department.</p>
                        <p>A. Demands</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> return to strict observance of
                            1954 Accords with respect <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and the
                            1962 agreement with respect to Laos—that is, stop infiltration and bring
                            about a cessation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> armed insurgency.
                            (With respect to Laos strictly observe the 1962 Accords, including the
                            withdrawal of all Viet <persName>Minh</persName> forces and personnel
                            from Laos and recognize that the freedom of movement granted therein in
                            Laos under those Accords is not subject to veto or interference by any
                            of the parties in Laos.)</p>
                        <p>B. In return and subject in each instance to a judgement that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is complying faithfully and
                            effectively:</p>
                        <p>1. US will return to 1954 Accords with respect to military personnel in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be willing to enter into trade talks looking
                            toward normalization of economic relations between <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Subject to faithful compliances by DRV with 1954 Accords, US and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would give assurances that they
                            would not use force or support the use of force by any other party to
                            upset the Accords with respect to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Within the framework of the 1954 Accords, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would permit <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> desiring
                            to do so to return to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> without
                            their arms and would grant amnesty to those peacefully laying down their
                            arms and desiring to remain in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_234" n="234" facs="0266"/>
                        <p>C. If and when Hanoi indicates its acceptance of foregoing conditions,
                            careful consideration must be given to immediate subsequent procedures
                            which will avoid danger of: (a) becoming involved in a cease-fire

                            (b) making conditions so stringent as to be unworkable from practical
                            point of view. Probably best procedure would be to have the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            meet in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> at the military level
                            under <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> auspices with US observers to
                            reach agreement mechanics of carrying out understanding while action
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> continues, at least in principle.
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would have to be associated with
                            these negotiations at some point.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that one of the most difficult aspects as we proceed with
                            the graduated reprisal program, if approved, will be how to establish
                            communications with Hanoi and at the same time not to become involved in
                            direct negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. One
                            possible formula might be for the US to talk with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> while USSR talks with Hanoi and with
                            the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> talking together.
                            Other possibilities will undoubtedly suggest themselves to the
                            Department. Another difficult problem should we reach the stage of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> negotiations will be how we can maintain the threat of
                            continued reprisals in order to prevent DRV stalling and achieving a de
                            facto cease-fire and to permit us to verify that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is acting in good faith and that VC have not merely
                            gone underground only to arise again. We have no sure fire formulae at
                            the moment but wish to flag these problems for intensive study.<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">The Embassy offered further comments on a

                                State contended that any South Vietnamese Government that did not
                                take into account the power of both the military and the Buddhists
                                was not likely to last very long. (Ibid.)</note> We believe we
                            detect in reftel certain variations from our thinking on recent
                            political events which are worth discussing as they involve an
                            evaluation of the relative weight of important factors entering into the
                            political scene here.</p>
                        <p>We agree that two predominant elements in the political picture are the
                            military and the Buddhist Institute leaders (not Buddhists in general),
                            but would stress that they are by no means of equal importance. The
                            Institute leaders have limited ability to stir up trouble and raise
                            mobs, particularly in the Hue area. The armed forces, on the other hand,
                            have the physical means to put down any such demonstrations and to
                            maintain law and order if their senior generals are determined to do so.
                            During the recent period of demonstrations, we have found no signs of
                            deep grassroots support for the Buddhist Institute and continue to
                            believe that except in Hue area their strength essentially superficial.
                            Huong had them on the ropes and would probably have survived their
                            attacks had the military stood by him.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, we entirely concur that any govt here must reflect power
                            realities. While military and Buddhist Institute are, as <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has called them, “most
                            turbulent elements;” Catholics, particularly northern elements, who have
                            thus far remained quiet, cannot be ignored. We also should not ignore
                            the larger mass of Vietnamese people who, while thus far have not been
                            organized and who do not yet have an articulate spokesman, are stoutly
                            opposed to the increasingly neutralist trend of the Buddhist Institute.
                            As we have previously pointed out no formula will be entirely acceptable
                            to the Institute that does not give de facto control over the govt. Such
                            control is entirely incompatible with effective prosecution of this war.
                            A govt acceptable to both military and Buddhists, as well as to
                            Catholics and other non-Communist elements, is hardly possible for it
                            means the reconciling of virtual opposites. Nevertheless we of course
                            entirely agree that we should not encourage the formation of a govt
                            which is unnecessarily provocative to the Buddhist Institute. Given
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s predominant role in
                            the formation of the govt and his predilection for seeking deals with
                            the Buddhist Institute, we <pb xml:id="pg_236" n="236" facs="0268"/>have
                            simply been seeking to assure that a reasonable balance be
                            maintained.</p>

                            will be noted that <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>,

                            which is important to Buddhist Institute. Generals <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and Nghiem are also all acceptable to the Buddhist
                            Institute. Buddhist Institute likely to oppose Vien himself and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>. However, regardless
                            of attitude Institute takes toward govt, it is certain they will press
                            hard for removal of Colonel Ben, Head of Police and <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Colonel Dong</persName> of Capital Military
                            District simply because both have effectively kept order in Saigon.
                            Removal of Colonel Ben would destroy morale of police and much of
                            progress that we have been able to make in building up police structure.
                            It seems to us that we must continue to resist such moves even though it
                            incurs the wrath of the Institute.</p>
                        <p>In closing, we do not feel that this Embassy has ever tried “to shore up
                            a govt besieged by both military and Buddhists.” We did support the
                            Huong govt which, until Jan 26, successfully resisted the Buddhists with
                            the support of the armed forces. When, between Jan 25 and Jan 26,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and company pulled
                            the rug from under <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName>, there
                            was no shoring up to be done since his govt or any other would
                            necessarily fall with the withdrawal of military support. The latter is
                            indespensable for the continued existence of any govt in South Vietnam;
                            the support of the Institute leaders is not, as long as the military are
                            willing to stand up against them.</p>
                        <p>Thus we feel that our primary objective should be to encourage the
                            formation of a govt headed by a resolute <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, civilian or military, who has the full support of
                            the armed forces and the will to maintain order against all comers. Our
                            efforts should be discrete and invisible to the naked eye since no
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> official will thrive long who can
                            be accused of being a U.S. puppet.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName>:</p>
                        <p>The President has asked me to acknowledge your memorandum of February
                                10,<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">
                                <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> with its
                            considerations directed specifically at the second major Viet Cong
                            attack. Let me once again try to comment in order on your specific
                            points.</p>
                        <p>1. We of course are watching the Communist defenses against air attack
                            with great care, and all missions are designed in the light of the most
                            up-to-date information we can get. You are entirely right in believing
                            that this question of Communist air defenses is of critical
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>2. It is not our current expectation that any single retaliation can be
                            expected at this stage to cool off the situation. It is clear that for
                            the <pb xml:id="pg_238" n="238" facs="0270"/>immediate future the
                            Vietnamese Communists will try as hard as they can to show that they
                            have more determination than we. The choice we are facing, however, is
                            the choice between making a reply and not making one, and it is in that
                            framework that the President's decision was made. As he said last
                                night,<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">Apparently a reference to remarks
                                made by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at

                            is designed to be prompt, adequate, and measured.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no question that Americans on the ground in Vietnam face the
                            prospect of harassment by the Viet Cong. The Pleiku incident makes it
                            clear that they faced the prospect before our current replies were
                            begun, and as I said in my last letter,<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">
                                <ref target="#d94">Document 94</ref>.</note> it is obviously of high
                            importance that our commanders out there should do everything they can
                            to take all the precautionary measures that they can against such
                            harassment. Nevertheless, you are quite right in pointing to this as a
                            continuing problem.</p>
                        <p>4. Only the future can tell what the long-term reaction of the South
                            Vietnamese people may be, but it seems to us much too soon to reach your
                            pessimistic conclusion that the help from the South Vietnamese will
                            decrease if a tit-for-tat pattern develops. We shall certainly be doing
                            all that we can do to prevent such a result, and as the President
                            remarked last night, the most important single thing which we can do is
                            to avoid an appearance that the American people are looking for an easy
                            way out in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. The problem of possible international conferences is a most important
                            and interesting one, and so is the question of the terms which we set as
                            a part of any possible future discussions. I am not sure just what you
                            mean by a “call for cease-fire.” If the cease-fire were to apply to all
                            forces in South Vietnam, it would seem to me to be an effort to apply
                            equal standards to the cops and to the robbers; but if it is a matter of
                            saying that any replies we make in the North can be stopped the minute
                            there is an end to the aggression in the South, I can see great merit in
                            it.</p>
                        <p>6. The President asked me to repeat again that he values your continuing
                            counsel on this very difficult problem.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In response to your request at the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff on 8 February 1965, an initial program of military actions against
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has been developed.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">No other record of the discussion at this meeting
                                has been found. The program of air strikes against North Vietnam was
                                code named Rolling Thunder.</note> The program extends over a period
                            of eight weeks and is confined generally to targets along Route 7 and
                            south of the 19th parallel. It employs both <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and US forces and is primarily a plan for air strikes.
                            It also provides for naval gunfire bombardment and for continuation of
                            present activity, including 34A operations, resumption of DeSoto
                            Patrols, and authorization for ground cross border operations. Details
                            as to targets, time phasing, and force requirements are contained in
                            Appendix A and the Annexes thereto<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">None of
                                the attached appendixes or annexes is printed.</note> (the weapons
                            requirements for the lettered targets in the Annexes are presently being
                            computed and will be forwarded to you as a matter of priority); 34A
                            operations, DeSoto Patrols, and ground cross border operations are in
                            Appendices E, F, and G, respectively.</p>
                        <p>2. It is visualized that the initial overt air strikes of this program
                            will have been undertaken as a retaliation in response to a provocative
                            act by Viet Cong or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces against
                            US or <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> personnel or installations.
                            Successive overt operations to provide sustained pressures and
                            progressive destruction will be continued on the plausible justification
                            of further provocations, which on the basis of recent past experience
                            seem quite likely to exist. As this program continues the realistic need
                            for precise event-association in this reprisal context will
                            progressively diminish. A wide range of activities are within the scope
                            of what may be stated <pb xml:id="pg_241" n="241" facs="0273"/>to be
                            provocations justifying reprisal. A list of examples is in Appendix
                            B.</p>
                        <p>3. The proposed program, with anticipation of extending the effort in
                            intensity and target coverage, provides an initial build-up of forces as
                            shown in Appendix A. This build-up, consisting of an immediate
                            deployment of over 325 aircraft to WESTPAC, provides a visible deterrent
                            to Communist China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and,
                            together with the alerted forces, improves our capability to cope with
                            possible escalation.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, Communist China, and the Soviet Union will make every
                            effort through propaganda and diplomatic moves to halt the US attacks.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> also will take all actions to
                            defend itself, and open, overt aggression in South Vietnam and Laos by
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might occur. In addition, the
                            mere initiation of the new US policy almost certainly would not lead
                            Hanoi to restrain the Viet Cong; Hanoi would probably elect to maintain
                            the very intense levels of activity of the past few days. However, if
                            the United States persevered in the face of threats and international
                            pressures, and as the degree of damage inflicted on North Vietnam
                            increased, the chance of a reduction in Viet Cong activity would rise.
                            They further believe that the Chinese Communists would be reluctant to
                            become directly involved in the fighting in Southeast Asia; however, as
                            the number and severity of US attacks against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> increase, they probably would feel an
                            increased compulsion to take some dramatic action to counter the impact
                            of the US pressures. There is a fair chance that Peiping would introduce
                            limited numbers of Chinese ground forces as “volunteers” into North
                            Vietnam, and/or northern Laos, intending to raise the specter of further
                            escalation, to underline its commitment to assist the North Vietnamese,
                            and to challenge the Soviets to extend corresponding support. They also
                            believe that the probable Soviet response to these US courses of action
                            would consist both of a vigorous diplomatic and propaganda effort to
                            bring the United States to the conference table and the provisions of
                            military support to North Vietnam. While the extent and nature of the
                            latter are difficult to predict, it almost certainly would include
                            antiaircraft artillery and radars. In order to provide more effective
                            defense against the US air attacks, North Vietnam would probably press
                            for surface-to-air missiles. The chances are about even that the Soviets
                            would agree to provide some SA–2 defenses, but they would do so in ways
                            calculated to minimize the initial risks to them. By providing the
                            necessary Soviet personnel in the guise of “technicians,” the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could preserve the option of ignoring
                            any Soviet casualties. In the event the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Communist Chinese openly undertake aggressive
                            actions, the United States and its allies can deal with them adequately.
                            Two possible plans available for use against a Communist offensive are
                            CINCPAC Operation Plan 32–64, which is a plan for the defense of
                            mainland Southeast Asia, and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>

                            provides primarily for offensive air and naval actions in Southeast Asia
                            and against mainland China.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">

                            Significant logistic deficiencies, as indicated in <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–955–64, dated 14 November 1964,

                            implementation of Phase III and IV of that Plan and, to an undetermined
                            extent, in the implementation of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Operation Plan 39–65. These logistic implications
                            are treated in Appendix H.</p>
                        <p>6. It is the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the program herein
                            proposed will demonstrate to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            that continuation of its direction and support of insurgencies will lead
                            progressively to more serious punishment. If the insurgency continues
                            with active <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support, strikes against
                            the DRV will be extended with intensified efforts against targets north
                            of the 19th parallel.</p>
                        <p>7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that the proposed eight-weeks
                            program of attacks against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> targets
                            be approved.</p>
                        <p>8. While the Chief of Staff, US Army, agrees with the deployments
                            proposed in the plan insofar as they go, he is not in agreement with the
                            adequacy of the ground forces deployed. One US Infantry Division is
                            required in northeast Thailand, as a minimum. A second US Infantry
                            Division in the same area is desirable. It is the view of the Chief of
                            Staff, US Army, that the program of strikes proposed in the Appendix
                            hereto can be supported. However, in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            and Thailand the logistic support for an effort expanded to the full
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Operation Plan 32–64,
                            Phase IV, and tentative <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            Operation Plan 39–65 is inadequate to sustain the effort because there
                            are inadequate <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> stocks and an
                            inadequate <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> distribution system.</p>
                        <p>9. The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, supports the strike program set
                            forth herein and the force movements recommended. He believes, however,
                            that as a further action to the measures proposed herein, the
                            feasibility and desirability of making additional deployments to the <pb xml:id="pg_243" n="243" facs="0275"/>Western Pacific area once these
                            forces are in position should be examined as a matter of priority. A
                            follow-on study for this purpose has been initiated.</p>

                        <p>1693. We are working urgently to refine your recommendations and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s, which are very similar, into a
                            systematic course of action constituting in effect a modified Phase II
                            program. The principal differences appear to be that we will justify our
                            actions as responses <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> action and that
                            tempo may hopefully be somewhat slower than some versions of Phase II
                            had envisaged.</p>
                        <p>In our analysis to date, latter point assumes great importance. Ideally,
                            we would like to lengthen the time before we reach a fork in the road at
                            which negotiating pressures become extreme, or dangers of sharp
                            Communist response become substantial, or both, while at the same time
                            maintaining necessary pattern of response and pressure both to
                            strengthen SVN situation and eventually to affect Hanoi attitudes.</p>
                        <p>Timing and criteria for specific actions thus crucial. Hanoi may force
                            our hand, as it did by Qui Nhon and other actions, so that there is
                            really no choice but to respond at once. However, we remain anxious to
                            keep our response actions controllable and optional to maximum degree
                            possible, and particularly to relate timing to any special factor
                            outside <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. For example, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s continued presence in Far
                            East gave us concern yesterday although we concluded immediate action
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we will need to stay in closest touch assessing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions against threshold of further
                            response actions. Procedurally, we want to <pb xml:id="pg_244" n="244" facs="0276"/>keep maximum discretion here and try to make our own
                            minds up before we become in any degree committed to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to specific actions. There may be cases
                            where provocations so extreme that failure to consult immediately with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could be construed as hesitancy
                            and have adverse effect on them; night of February 10 was probably such
                            a case, and we accept your judgment. However, we should have general
                            practice of consultation with Washington prior to any <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approaches which inevitably tend to
                            commit us and could tilt the scales wrongly on timing decisions.</p>
                        <p>An underlying basic point—and another factor pointing to controlled
                            tempo—is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and South Vietnamese
                            generally should not slide into believing we have taken over the war and
                            they can resume bickering and not go all out in the field. Would
                            appreciate your judgment how far such danger exists as we go along. Your
                            present estimate would also be helpful in next few days.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note>

                            course of sustained air attacks on North Vietnam.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Scope Note</p>
                        <p>This US course is presumed to start with a public declaration outlining
                            the new policy and linking it to the entire range of Viet Cong guerrilla
                            and terrorist activity in South Vietnam. This declaration, we further
                            presume, makes it clear that the US means to go beyond specific
                            reprisals for individual major Viet Cong actions and to continue air
                            attacks until the threat to South Vietnam has been reduced to levels
                            which the US regards as tolerable. We consider in this estimate present
                            Communist attitudes and Communist reactions, particularly Soviet
                            reactions, in the period before and during continuing air attacks, and
                            during any period when these attacks are suspended.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Situation</p>
                        <p>1. Reversing Khrushchev's policy of minimum involvement in Southeast
                            Asia, the new Soviet leaders have over the past several months begun to
                            reassert the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s interest,
                            particularly in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit to Hanoi is the latest step in this process.
                            We believe that, in embarking on these tactics, the Soviet leaders hoped
                            to work Hanoi back toward a middle position in the Sino-Soviet dispute,
                            to discourage the US from broadening the war, and to participate in the
                            Communist victory which they expected. To these ends, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably planned to offer to
                            strengthen North Vietnamese air defenses and to provide equipment for
                            use in insurgency and subversion.</p>
                        <p>2. The recent <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks and US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reprisals probably cut across Soviet
                            calculations. The US course of action under consideration here would
                            further undermine these calculations and force the Soviets to
                            reconsider; indeed, they are probably already doing so. In the meantime,
                            however, they have already reconfirmed their commitment to North
                            Vietnam, albeit in general terms, with a government statement promising
                            “further measures to safeguard the security and strengthen the defensive
                            capability” of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Soviet public statements after the attacks of last weekend had a
                            cautionary flavor, and we believe that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s private representatives to Hanoi were of a
                            similar nature. Nevertheless, Hanoi has evidently chosen to maintain a
                            high level of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pressures in South
                            Vietnam, including attacks against US facilities, perhaps in part to
                            force the Soviets into a stronger commitment. China for its part is
                            almost certainly seeking to sharpen the Soviet dilemma of a choice
                            between support for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, whatever
                            the dangers of confrontation with the US, or a withdrawal which Peiping
                            could portray as confirmation of its case against Moscow.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Uncertainties</p>
                        <p>4. At the outset, the Communists would have to determine how to interpret
                            the new policy declared by the US. We believe that they would <pb xml:id="pg_246" n="246" facs="0278"/>understand that the US did in
                            fact intend a course of sustained pressure against North Vietnam. Even
                            at the beginning, however, they would see some chance that their own
                            threats and international pressures could succeed in averting air
                            attacks or keeping them at a low level. Unless attacks continued
                            regularly and frequently thereafter and the US Government displayed a
                            consistent determination to persevere, the Communists would tend to
                            doubt that the US would long sustain this course of action.</p>
                        <p>5. Another important initial uncertainty relates to timing. In the course
                            of reasserting their interest in Vietnam, the Soviets may have extended
                            specific commitments, including offers of military aid, of which we are
                            not yet aware. Or they may do so between now and the time when the new
                            US policy is announced. In either case, the USSR's freedom to disengage
                            in reaction to the new US program would be reduced, although not
                            entirely eliminated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Reactions</p>
                        <p>6. It is possible that, once the US has demonstrated the seriousness of
                            its intentions, the Soviets would revert to a policy of minimum
                            involvement. But we think it unlikely that they would do so; their
                            commitment to date probably has already carried them past this point.
                            Although the Soviets would perceive military risks in more direct
                            involvement, they would expect to be able to keep these at a tolerable
                            level and far removed from the Soviet homeland. They would also expect
                            difficulties in their relations with Washington, but the new leaders
                            have thus far shown themselves at least as concerned to win support of
                            other Communists and anti-Western radicals as to carry forward a détente
                            with the US.</p>
                        <p>7. We believe that the Soviet response to the US program of air attacks
                            would consist both of a vigorous diplomatic and propaganda effort to
                            bring the US to the conference table and the provision of military
                            support to North Vietnam. The extent and nature of the latter are
                            difficult to predict. It would almost certainly include anti-aircraft
                            artillery and radars. In order to provide a more effective defense
                            against US air attacks, however, North Vietnam would almost certainly
                            press for surface-to air missiles or even advanced jet fighters. These
                            systems would, at the present time, have to be installed and operated by
                            Soviet personnel.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">In the case of the SA–2

                                Advanced jet fighters could be provided more quickly. [Footnote in

                        </p>
                        <p>8. In considering these advanced systems, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would recognize that missile sites and fighter bases
                            in North Vietnam would be <pb xml:id="pg_247" n="247" facs="0279"/>highly vulnerable to US attack. The Soviets would appreciate that
                            successful attacks on these targets would face them with a choice of
                            accepting the damage, substantially boosting their involvement in the
                            defense of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, or becoming party to
                            even more provocative escalation. It may be that, rather than open up
                            these dangers, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would refrain
                            from providing SAMs and fighters. Yet a refusal to satisfy North
                            Vietnamese requests for this kind of aid would be costly to the Soviet
                            position, the more so if such aid had previously been promised.</p>
                        <p>9. On balance, we think that the chances are about even that the Soviets
                            would provide some SA–2 defenses to North Vietnam. Such a move would run
                            counter to the preferred Soviet tactics of increasing their commitments
                            only when the dangers of confrontation have begun to recede. But the
                            present degree of Soviet involvement, plus the political costs of
                            failing to provide support in the circumstances under consideration,
                            might outweigh their caution in the present case.</p>
                        <p>10. If the Soviets should provide SA–2s, we believe that they would do so
                            in ways calculated to minimize the initial risks to them. One likely way
                            of doing this would be to deploy some SA–2 defenses for the key
                            Hanoi-Haiphong area, hoping that this degree of involvement would serve
                            to restrain the US and still not engage Soviet personnel in actual
                            fighting. SA–2s deployed in this area, however, probably would be used
                            if attacking US aircraft came within their range. By providing Soviet
                            personnel in the guise of “technicians,” the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would preserve the option of ignoring any Soviet
                            casualties.</p>
                        <p>11. This would be a fairly limited Soviet involvement, but it would
                            represent a greater commitment to North Vietnam than has obtained in the
                            past. In this situation of increased risks, we believe that the USSR
                            would be seeking means to curb the conflict. This effort would consist
                            both of threats against the US and of attempts to mobilize international
                            pressures on the US to negotiate, probably in the Geneva forum.</p>
                        <p>12. If these efforts failed, however, the Soviets might in time advise
                            Hanoi to damp down operations in South Vietnam or even to entertain a
                            political settlement on terms not completely unacceptable to the US.
                            This would be a delicate operation for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would charge
                            that what was needed was not less Viet Cong aggressiveness but more
                            effective Soviet assistance, and Peiping would almost certainly take the
                            same line. We cannot at this time predict whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would try this approach nor, if it
                            did, what the results would be.</p>
                        <p>13. Elsewhere in the world, general Soviet policy would harden against
                            the US. This would tend to preclude moves toward a relaxation of
                            tensions and to increase the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            verbal ugliness on other East-West issues. The new leaders, however,
                            have in any event not been inclined to date to move very far toward
                            detente. Nonetheless, we think it highly unlikely that they would react
                            to the US course of action considered here <pb xml:id="pg_248" n="248" facs="0280"/>by deliberately provoking a major crisis in some other
                            area of the world, e.g., Berlin or Cuba.</p>

                        <p>14. Initiation of the new US policy almost certainly would not lead Hanoi
                            to restrain the Viet Cong. Hanoi would probably elect to maintain the
                            very intense levels of activity evident in the past few days. Pressures
                            might be stepped up in Laos at the same time. The anger and emotion with
                            which the US program would be received in Hanoi might affect its
                            calculations. In any case, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would
                            wish to avoid an impression of weakness at the outset. Moreover, it
                            would have some doubt about US staying power on its new course and would
                            hope that Sino-Soviet competition would maximize the support provided by
                            both allies. If the US persevered in the face of threats and
                            international pressures, and as the degree of damage inflicted on North
                            Vietnam increased, the chances of a reduction in Viet Cong activity
                            would rise (see paragraph 18).</p>
                        <p>15. The insurgency in South Vietnam is heavily dependent on support,
                            leadership, and direction from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>,
                            but the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> nonetheless has substantial
                            capabilities independent of Hanoi. Thus Hanoi could probably achieve a
                            substantial stand down for tactical purposes and could effect a more
                            lasting reduction. Nonetheless, the insurgency in South Vietnam has a
                            momentum of its own, and some hostile <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            action would probably continue, though at reduced levels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Chinese Reactions</p>
                        <p>16. China would be equally violent in castigating the new US course. At
                            the outset of the new US program, there is a fair chance that Peiping
                            would also introduce limited numbers of Chinese ground forces as
                            “volunteers” into North Vietnam, intending to raise the specter of
                            further escalation, to underline its commitment to assist the North
                            Vietnamese, and to challenge the Soviets to extend corresponding
                            support. More extreme Chinese reactions—such as introduction of
                            large-scale ground force combat units into North Vietnam or northern
                            Laos—would be possible, though we think this unlikely in the early
                            stages. If the US program continued and inflicted severe damage on North
                            Vietnam, the chances of such a movement would rise. But we still think
                            that China, conscious of the danger of provoking major US attacks
                            against its own territory, probably would not take this step.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">The Director of Intelligence and Research,

                        <p>17. A special problem for the Communists lies in the fact that only three
                            North Vietnamese airfields, all located in the northern part of the
                            country, are fully capable of sustaining jet fighter operations.<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">At Kien An in northern North Vietnam and at
                                Vinh and Dong Hoi in southern North Vietnam, there are airfields on
                                which jet fighters (including <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>-21s) can land and take off, but none of these fields
                                has ancillary facilities sufficient to support sustained operations.
                                Thus, while North Vietnam has six fields with runways adequate for
                                jet fighters, only three (Phuc Yen, Hanoi/Gia Lam, Haiphong/Cat Bi)
                                can support sustained jet fighter operations. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> Fighters would thus have difficulty in engaging
                                US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> aircraft attacking targets in
                            the southern part of North Vietnam. Furthermore, the Communists
                            recognize that US retaliation against these airfields would be feasible
                            and effective. These considerations apply to the use of Soviet and
                            Chinese fighters in North Vietnam as well as to the interceptors which
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might be able to put into the
                            air with Soviet or Chinese assistance. Despite these capabilities, the
                            Communists probably would employ the fighters based in North Vietnam
                            against the US air attacks. If US air attacks reached the northern part
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, China might react over North
                            Vietnam with fighters from its own bases.<note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5">The Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State,

                        <p>18. The Communists could react by launching air attacks against South
                            Vietnam from North Vietnamese or Chinese bases. We think this unlikely
                            because of the vulnerability of North Vietnamese bases and China's
                            reluctance to risk retaliation against its own territory.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Possible Communist Tactic</p>
                        <p>19. If at some point the Communists had become persuaded of the
                            durability of the new US policy, they might adopt tactics designed to
                            provide a respite. This might come about if US attacks were inflicting
                            severe damage and if, at the same time, the US had made clear an
                            intention to reduce or cease its attacks in return for a sharp reduction
                            of Viet Cong activity in South Vietnam. In these circumstances, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might order such a reduction and
                            use an ensuing period of calm to press for a negotiated cease-fire and
                            an international conference. At the same time, it might use the respite
                            for a major buildup, assisted by its allies. Such a buildup might
                            include extensive SA–2 deployments, additions to jet fighter strength in
                            North Vietnam and southern China, and large-scale deployments of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Chinese ground forces suitable for
                            rapid invasions. The Communists might expect that they could complete
                            these preparations without US interference, and that thereafter the US
                            would be deterred from resuming its program of air attacks when Viet
                            Cong activity was again stepped up.</p>

                        <p>20. It is obviously to Communist advantage to appear unified, and they
                            will make great efforts to convey this impression. Heightened military
                            conflict would itself exert strong pressures for effective unity.
                            Nevertheless, we have at several points indicated our belief that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China act as competitors
                            in North Vietnamese affairs and that they would continue to do so during
                            a period of sustained US air attacks on North Vietnam. We have also
                            pointed to complex and conflicting interests which make for delicate
                            relations—and difficult communications—between Hanoi and both its
                            allies. We think it likely that policy coordination among three
                            Communist countries involved will be chronically imperfect and
                            occasionally quite erratic. Hence, Communist policies and reactions will
                            at times be faltering and uncertain and at others bold to the point of
                            rashness. In any case, since Communist policies will be constantly
                            fashioned and refashioned to meet a constantly changing situation, they
                            will be difficult to foresee very far ahead.</p>

                            example, we, too, are developing a proposal for a specific course of
                            action to implement the concept of reference B. We would hope that you
                            will not close your books until we have the opportunity to make our
                            contribution.</p>
                        <p>In review of the rationale for concept of graduated reprisals, we are of
                            the opinion that, in order of importance, it should have the following
                            objectives: (A) the will of Hanoi leaders; (B) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale; and (C) physical damage to installations having
                            some bearing on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ability to
                            support <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Of these three, first appears
                            to us by far the most important, since our effectiveness in influencing
                            Hanoi leadership will, in the long <pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251" facs="0283"/>run, determine the success or failure of our efforts in
                            both North and South Vietnam. Second objective, effect on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale, is also important and
                            fortunately the requirements for building morale in the South are
                            roughly the same as those for impressing Hanoi leaders with the rising
                            costs of their support of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. In this
                            case, what is bad for Hanoi is generally good for Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Effect of the physical destruction of material objects and infliction of
                            casualties will not, in our judgment, have a decisive bearing upon the
                            ability of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. However, degree of damage and number of
                            casualties inflicted gauge the impact of our operations on Hanoi
                            leadership and hence are important as a measure of their discomfort.</p>
                        <p>If one accepts the foregoing rationale, one can then pass to a
                            consideration of methods and procedures appropriate to implementation of
                            such a concept. We agree with the Dept that we should keep our response
                            actions controllable and optional to maximum degree possible so that we
                            can act or withhold action when and as we choose. This need for
                            flexibility argues strongly for vagueness in defining criteria for
                            situations justifying retaliation and for retention of freedom of action
                            to make ad hoc decisions in light of our interests at the moment. But in
                            any case, complete flexibility will not be possible for at least two
                            reasons. First the GRV may perpetuate an untimely atrocity like Qui Nhon
                            which we cannot ignore. Second, we will probably receive from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> more requests for retaliatory strikes
                            in excess of the optimum tempo which we wish to give the operations. To
                            turn down the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> too often will work
                            against factor of morale which we mentioned at the outset and sour
                            relations which we hope to sweeten. We shall have to take this point
                            into account.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that we have achieved control and flexibility, we will then need
                            to think of the tempo which we wish to communicate to the retaliatory
                            program, with primary consideration given to effect of the program on
                            Hanoi leadership. It seems clear to us that there should be a gradual,
                            orchestrated acceleration of tempo measured in terms of frequency, size,
                            number and/or geographical location of the reprisal strikes and of
                            related activities such as Barrel Roll and 34–A. An upward trend in any
                            or all these forms of intensity will convey signals which, in
                            combination, should present to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            leaders a vision of inevitable, ultimate destruction if they do not
                            change their ways.</p>
                        <p>The exact rate of acceleration is a matter of judgment but we consider,
                            roughly speaking, that each successive week should include some new act
                            on our part to increase pressure on Hanoi. As indicated at the outset,
                            we are working on a paper<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> which will contain specific suggestions along
                            these lines.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_252" n="252" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>We note your comment with regard to avoiding contact with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> prior to consulting Washington. We can
                            see advantage of first getting the Washington reaction before that of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but would point out the
                            difficulty, if not impossibility, of obtaining <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> participation in a strike during the daylight hours
                            following a night atrocity without starting the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> wheels turning as soon as retaliatory actions appear
                            likely. This difficulty is not an overriding objection because, in our
                            view, there is an operational need henceforth to stagger our attacks in
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in order to avoid being trapped
                            in an unchanging pattern of reaction. The three strikes which we have
                            executed thus far have all fallen between 1400 and 1600 of the first day
                            following the atrocity. We are bound to increase the hazards to our
                            pilots if we do not vary our schedule.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that our reprisal program will lead the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to believe that we have taken over
                            their war and that they can reduce their anti-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities. We hope that the opposite will be the effect
                            and the retaliatory actions in the North will give impulsion to the
                            defensive efforts in the South. However, the Dept's fear can certainly
                            not be ruled out and we shall watch closely the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction to the program as it unfolds.</p>

                        <p>The memorandum consists of two major parts.</p>
                        <p>Part I is a discussion of the probable risks inherent in a program of
                            gradually mounting military pressure on the North. In spite of these
                            risks, we are in general agreement on this program.</p>
                        <p>We have taken account of these risks in connection with the military
                            actions already taken. As we move—step by step—up the scales of military
                            action you will certainly wish to appraise the level of risk at each
                            point—although admittedly your ability to control exposure to risk is
                            likely to diminish as the scale and intensity of military pressure
                            increases.</p>
                        <p>Part II of the memorandum is a program of political action. Such a
                            program is an essential accompaniment to the military program. It is
                            needed for several reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. To make clear to the world that our objectives are peace and
                            freedom;</p>
                        <p>b. To minimize the danger of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>
                            engagement and Chinese and Soviet involvement, giving the Soviets an
                            alternative to support the Chinese militancy;</p>
                        <p>c. To pre-empt a probable peace offensive by the Communists;</p>
                        <p>d. To enable you to opt for a political settlement at any point where you
                            determine that the risks of further military pressure have become
                            prohibitive in the light of our over-all interests.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Nature and Objectives of the Proposed Military
                            Program</p>
                        <p>The course of action we are now proposing to follow (subject to
                            refinement by exchanges with Saigon and further staff work here)
                            envisages continued air attacks, on a joint United States/South
                            Vietnamese basis, against military targets directly related to North
                            Vietnamese infiltration. It also contemplates attacks on targets such as
                            railroad lines, in response to Viet Cong attacks on corresponding
                            targets in the South.</p>
                        <p>We would continue to justify such air attacks as responses to Viet Cong
                            action in the South. Viet Cong attacks on United States personnel and
                            installations would call for practically automatic responses. Other Viet
                            Cong activities would be assessed continuously, and the criteria for
                            response left as flexible as possible.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_254" n="254" facs="0286"/>
                        <p>Since we would seek to justify our attacks as responses to Viet Cong
                            actions we might not be able fully to control their tempo. However, we
                            would seek to keep as much flexibility as possible.</p>
                        <p>We envisage that the attacks would slowly increase in scale.</p>
                        <p>We propose to mount strikes at roughly weekly intervals unless our hand
                            is forced by dramatic <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental objective of this program is to increase United States
                            bargaining power, vis-a-vis Hanoi and Peiping, to the point where a
                            satisfactory political solution becomes possible. Hopefully these
                            attacks should also tend to improve morale and increase stability in
                            Saigon while impairing the infiltration efforts of the North
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Risks of War with Communist China</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot long continue air strikes against North Viet-Nam without
                            facing the likelihood of engagement with the 53 Chinese <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s sent to Hanoi to defend North
                            Viet-Nam. The danger of encountering these MIGs will increase as we
                            strike targets closer and closer to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>In our air strikes to date, we have hit targets up to sixty miles north
                            of the 17th parallel. At some point—if we close the remaining gap of 250
                            miles to Hanoi—engagement by United States planes with the 53 <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s sent to Hanoi will become inevitable.
                            We recommend delaying the chances of MIG involvement by continuing for
                            the next eight weeks to confine our strikes to targets below the 19th
                            parallel. Such targets lie outside the effective range of the ground
                            control center of the Hanoi-Haiphong complex.</p>
                        <p>2. Once our planes have been engaged heavily by <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> aircraft, you will be compelled—in order to prevent
                            unacceptable losses—to face the decision to mount an air effort to
                            eliminate the major <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> base at Phuc
                            Yen, near Hanoi. This base is heavily defended. Some parts of the base
                            are near populated areas. Any effective strike against it would require
                            a massive air effort.</p>
                        <p>2a. If we hit targets in or approaching the Hanoi-Haiphong area, it will
                            be likely at some point to trigger a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            ground force move South. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can
                            support an invasion of 125,000 troops (20–50,000 through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>; balance through Laos). There is no
                            current estimate of what US response would be needed to stop this
                            action. It would clearly require substantial increases of US ground, air
                            and naval forces.</p>
                        <p>3. Last November, the United States intelligence community unanimously
                            agreed that, if the United States attacked above the 19th parallel,
                            “Chinese Communist aircraft operating from Chinese bases would probably
                            assist in defending North Viet-Nam against the United States
                                attacks”.<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">The Feb. 11 estimate is that
                                this “might” occur. [Footnote in the source text. Reference is to
                                Document 111, paragraph 17.]</note> Perhaps the involvement by
                            Chinese air would first take the <pb xml:id="pg_255" n="255" facs="0287"/>form of “volunteers,” but it might shortly be followed by direct
                            engagement of Chinese planes operating from the sanctuary of Chinese
                            territory. There are now approximately 350 Chinese jet fighters deployed
                            in the Hainan area of South China—within striking distance of North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Once Chinese aircraft entered the conflict you would be under
                            considerable pressure to order United States forces to knock out
                            offending Chinese bases—and even to strike at Chinese nuclear production
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>5. If Chinese air bases were hit, some of our intelligence experts
                            believe it likely that China would move massive ground forces into North
                            Viet-Nam, and subsequently into Laos, South Viet-Nam, and possibly
                            Thailand. Other experts assess the chances as being lower. All agree
                            that such a movement would be entirely possible.</p>
                        <p>6. If Chinese ground forces were to move into Southeast Asia, we would be
                            compelled to make a major effort to stop them. The only way that this
                            could be done through conventional means would be by introducing
                            substantial United States ground combat forces into South Viet-Nam. The
                            magnitude of the required effort would almost certainly mean that you
                            would have to call up reserves.</p>
                        <p>7. It is estimated that the Chinese have the logistical capacity to
                            support 14 Chinese divisions and 8 North Vietnamese divisions in a
                            movement into Laos, Thailand and South Viet-Nam (without taking account
                            of United States and Allied interdiction operations). In order to
                            counter this movement, we would be required to bring in 5 to 8 United
                            States divisions with a total troop strength (including supporting
                            elements) of 300,000 men.</p>
                        <p>8. The confrontation of Chinese ground forces by American ground forces
                            would induce debate in the United States as to the need to use nuclear
                            weapons—although <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> does not believe
                            there would be a military requirement for such weapons. Recalling the
                            Korean experience, some Americans would argue that United States ground
                            forces should not be asked to fight large numbers of Chinese troops
                            without resort to nuclear weapons, in which the United States has a
                            clear advantage.</p>
                        <p>9. To use nuclear weapons against the Chinese would obviously raise the
                            most profound political problems. Not only would their use generate
                            probably irresistible pressures for a major Soviet involvement, but the
                            United States would be vulnerable to the charge that it was willing to
                            use nuclear weapons against non-whites only.</p>
                        <p>10. Peiping's decision whether or not to intervene may well turn upon its
                            estimate of the extent to which it can expect Soviet support. Unless we
                            provide the Soviets with a political alternative they can support they
                            will be in a weak position to bring pressure on the Chinese Communists
                            to move toward a settlement. Without such a political <pb xml:id="pg_256" n="256" facs="0288"/>option they will also find
                            difficulty in resisting Chinese pressure to provide assistance in the
                            event of a United States-Chinese military conflict. Such a political
                            option is suggested in Part II of this paper.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Chances of Conflict with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>We cannot be certain at this time what the Soviets will do if we continue
                            our air strikes against North Viet-Nam—particularly if these strikes
                            lead to direct conflict with the Chinese. The Soviets may want the
                            Chinese and us to bloody our noses, but we doubt they would be in a
                            position to exploit this desire. In the last analysis, the Soviet stake
                            is the leadership of the Communist Bloc. Competition for that leadership
                            would probably force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the
                            direction of increasing its aid and involvement. On balance, we think it
                            highly likely that—if the war should continue and escalate—the Soviets
                            would feel compelled to extend an increasing amount of assistance to the
                            North Vietnamese and Chinese.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s trip has already
                            resulted in a commitment by the Soviets to give increased defense
                            assistance to Hanoi. We do not know what form this increase will take.
                            The United States Intelligence Community thinks “the chances are about
                            even” that ground-air missiles—probably with Soviet missile crews—will
                            be included. The likelihood of increased aid commitments will grow as
                            our raids extend northward to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. If we should become engaged directly with the Chinese, the Soviets
                            would be faced with a painful dilemma. Under the Sino-Soviet Friendship
                            Treaty (which is fifteen years old on February 14) the Soviets are
                            obligated to come to China's assistance if China is attacked. The Soviet
                            Union could avoid this commitment only by claiming that China's actions
                            had caused the attack. Under existing circumstances, this would be
                            tantamount to denouncing the treaty.</p>
                        <p>3. Since China is rich in manpower, the Soviets would probably seek to
                            limit their contribution to advanced military equipment. But, again, the
                            contribution to Soviet missile and other personnel or volunteers could
                            not be excluded.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet harassment of United States interests elsewhere might well be
                            another step in this sequence of events. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed out on Thursday that
                            “…the Soviets will be intrigued with possibilities inherent [in the]
                            somewhat less enthusiastic support of our policy in Southeast Asia by
                            [the] majority [of] Western European countries and may think that by
                            presenting them with [a] nasty flareup in central Europe and exerting
                            pressure on us to temper actions in Viet-Nam, they have [a] real
                            opportunity of causing serious intra-alliance friction.” </p>
                        <p>5. At the very least, progress toward improvement of United States-Soviet
                            relations would be severely set back. Moreover, we could look forward to
                            a substantial deterioration in the evolution of the Bloc <pb xml:id="pg_257" n="257" facs="0289"/>toward a reduction of tensions
                            and the development of a system more compatible with that of the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>C [D]. Negotiating Pressures and World Reactions</p>
                        <p>1. In many major capitals there are already signs of deep concern at the
                            present state of the conflict and the dangers of escalation. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>, the French, and India have
                            already called for some form of negotiation. The British have advised us
                            that they are under public pressure to take a negotiating initiative.
                            Labor back-benchers can be expected to increase this pressure with any
                            rise in the intensity of military operations. The Canadians have also
                            told us that they are considering proposals that would lead to
                            negotiation, although both they and the Indians do not propose an
                            immediate conference.</p>
                        <p>2. More generally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> has reported that there is substantial
                            sentiment in the United Nations favoring negotiation. This could
                            conceivably lead to negotiating initiatives.</p>
                        <p>3. Any escalation—even the repetition of air strikes at the present level
                            of intensity—will increase these pressures. If we found ourselves
                            engaged with the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s and particularly
                            if we were compelled to strike Phuc Yen, the Soviets, Indians,
                            Canadians, British, and others would almost certainly bring strong
                            pressure for immediate negotiations. Many would call for an immediate
                            conference with no preconditions—before we had built up sufficient
                            bargaining power.</p>
                        <p>4. Up to this point, we have the public support of Australia, New
                            Zealand, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines. We have, at
                            least, the understanding and acceptance of the Governments of the United
                            Kingdom, Canada, and our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            generally—except for France. On the other hand, we must recognize that
                            even such an ally as Japan has expressed its strong opposition to any
                            systematic program of air strikes against the North.</p>
                        <p>5. Even the continuance of military pressure against North Viet-Nam at
                            the present level would probably arouse sharp hostility among the
                            Afro-Asian nations. Indonesia would be of particular concern, since by
                            stepping up its actions against Malaysia it could create a two-front
                            conflict. The general attitudes of Afro-Asian and neutralist nations
                            need not be a serious drawback in themselves, but they would contribute
                            to an over-all world atmosphere highly critical of our position.</p>

                                infiltration from the North, but effectively to call off the
                                insurgency in the South and withdraw those elements infiltrated in
                                the past.” (The Past Has Another Pattern, pp. 504–505)</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> believe that we must pursue a course of
                            increasing military pressure to the point where Hanoi is prepared to
                            agree not only to stop infiltration from the North, but effectively to
                            call off the insurgency in the South and withdraw those elements
                            infiltrated in the past. To achieve this objective, they would accept
                            the risks of substantial escalation, including the acceptance of ground
                            warfare with Red China—although they believe it likely that we can
                            achieve the desired objective without such a war. This view is shared by

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> believe that—short of a

                            it has pursued at great cost for ten years and give up all the progress
                            it has made in the Communization of South Viet-Nam. For North Viet-Nam
                            to call off the insurgency in South Viet-Nam, close the border, and
                            withdraw the elements it had infiltrated into that country would mean
                            that it had accepted unconditional surrender.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> believe that Red China would
                            be extremely reluctant to permit Hanoi to suffer such unconditional
                            surrender since it would mean the collapse of the basic Chinese
                            ideological position which they have been disputing with the Soviets.
                            Peiping would thus be under great pressure to engage the United States
                            on the ground as well as in the air.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> believe that the Chinese
                            decision to intervene on the ground would, in the final analysis,
                            probably depend largely on the extent to which Peiping felt assured of
                            Soviet support. There is no way that we can safely predict whether or
                            not such support would be forthcoming. They are convinced, however, that
                            the risks of Chinese ground intervention would be great and the costs of
                            such intervention tremendous—particularly since the very taking of this
                            step by Peiping would presumably imply substantial Soviet involvement,
                            perhaps even to the point of a large-scale Soviet-US confrontation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> have supported the air strikes
                            that have so far taken place and they would support a program of
                            gradually increasing military pressure. They believe that only in this
                            way can the United <pb xml:id="pg_259" n="259" facs="0291"/>States
                            achieve a bargaining position that can make possible an international
                            arrangement that will avoid a humiliating defeat to the United States.
                            They do not believe, however, that we can realistically hope for an
                            international arrangement that will effectively stop the insurrection in
                            South Viet-Nam and deliver the entire country south of the Seventeenth
                            Parallel to the government in Saigon free and clear of insurgency. They
                            consider that the most we can realistically expect from any
                            international arrangement are measures to stop the infiltration so that
                            we may be able, over time, to reduce our commitments. Hopefully the
                            military actions preceding such an arrangement would have created a
                            sufficient sense of unity in Saigon to make it possible for the South
                            Vietnamese Government—with diminishing United States help—to clean up an
                            insurgency that had become manageable by the shutting of the
                            borders.</p>

                            prepared and alerted—whenever it appears that military conflict may have
                            reached the level of intensity where Chinese ground intervention seems
                            likely—to accept a cease-fire under international auspices short of the
                            achievement of our total political objectives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Elements of a Political Program</p>
                        <p>The political program we propose consists of four parts:</p>
                        <p>(a) The issuance of a joint US-South Viet-Nam statement of aims;</p>
                        <p>(b) Based on this statement, the submission of the South Vietnamese
                            problem to the Security Council and full discussion in the Security
                            Council of all aspects of that problem;</p>
                        <p>(c) Negotiation of the conditions for a conference to be conducted among
                            a group of countries consisting of the United States, Great Britain,
                            France, South Viet-Nam, North Viet-Nam, Red China, and the Soviet Union;
                            and</p>
                        <p>(d) Negotiations at the conference.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(a) Issuance of an Agreed US-South Viet-Nam
                            Statement of Aims</p>
                        <p>Ideally, the United States and South Viet-Nam should jointly issue a
                            statement of war aims as a prelude to the submission of the South
                            Viet-namese case to the Security Council. Because of the action of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> in issuing a statement
                            of his own, we may find it necessary for the President to outline our
                            objectives to the world over the weekend, without waiting for a full
                            South Vietnamese concurrence.</p>
                        <p>A joint US-South Vietnamese statement of aims would include these
                            elements:</p>
                        <p>1. The two governments intend to continue to take all necessary military
                            measures to stop the Communist aggression against the Republic of South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. Our joint and sole aim is to secure and maintain the political
                            independence and territorial integrity of South Viet-Nam so as to permit
                                <pb xml:id="pg_260" n="260" facs="0292"/>it to develop its
                            institutions and live in peace with its neighbors free from outside
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>3. The independence of South Viet-Nam requires the cessation of the
                            guerrilla activities in South Viet-Nam directed and supplied from the
                            North, the stopping of infiltration from the North, and the withdrawal
                            of Viet Cong cadres previously infiltrated into South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. South Vietnamese independence, which is the birthright of every
                            nation, large and small, should be internationally guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>5. Such a guarantee must be reinforced on the ground by peace-keeping
                            machinery with enough strength and a sufficient mandate to assure that
                            all parties to the agreement abide by their promises.</p>
                        <p>6. This machinery can best be established under the aegis of the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>7. Once these arrangements are carried out, the United States is prepared
                            to withdraw its military forces from South Viet-Nam. [It must, of
                            course, be made clear that any final arrangement should include the
                            right of South Viet-Nam to call in assistance at a moment's notice if
                            the United Nations' guarantee should prove inadequate.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(b) Submission to Security Council</p>
                        <p>As soon as possible—and we do not think that this can be delayed at the
                            most for more than a week—the United States should bring the Viet-Nam
                            issue to the United Nations Security Council. Conditions at the moment
                            are propitious since the Security Council has the most favorable
                            composition in years—the five permanent members, plus Bolivia, Uruguay,
                            the Netherlands, Malaysia, Jordan and the Ivory Coast.</p>
                        <p>1. In proceedings in the Security Council, the United States would:</p>
                        <p>(i) Present all available evidence to establish that the insurrection in
                            South Viet-Nam is not an indigenous revolt but an insurgency imposed,
                            directed, supplied, and inspired from North Viet-Nam. [The effective
                            establishment of this proposition may require some compromise of
                            existing intelligence. We should be prepared to do this.]</p>
                        <p>(ii) Call for the establishment of peace in South Viet-Nam under
                            conditions that will assure its independence. These include the halting
                            of infiltration and the stopping of the direction and encouragement of
                            the revolt from the North.</p>
                        <p>(iii) Call for a meeting with representatives of the Governments of the
                            United Kingdom, France, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist
                            China, North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam to discuss arrangements for a
                            cease-fire, the cessation of infiltration, and the establishment of
                            peace in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>(iv) Suggest that the Hanoi regime as well as the Republic of Viet-Nam be
                            invited to join in the deliberations of the Council.</p>
                        <p>2. It is unlikely that Hanoi would send representatives to New York. Most
                            probably both Hanoi and Peiping would scornfully reject the <pb xml:id="pg_261" n="261" facs="0293"/>Security Council proceedings—at
                            lease in the first instance. But taking the problem to the Security
                            Council and calling for peace negotiations—while stepping up our
                            military efforts and our military buildup—would increase the pressure on
                            the Soviets to help put an end to the crisis by joining in a call for a
                            cease-fire and a conference.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(c) Preparatory Meeting of the Six Countries</p>
                        <p>The proposed prepatory meeting would provide the forum for really serious
                            negotiations. By debating the conditions under which a conference might
                            be called—while at the same time continuing our military activity—we
                            might be able to push the other nations in the direction of our
                            objective.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(d) The Conference</p>
                        <p>If we should ever get to a Geneva-type conference we would presumably
                            have concluded most of the bargaining in the earlier proceedings. The
                            conference could, however, be the mechanism for arranging for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantees and a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence. Moreover, it would probably be desirable to
                            include a Laos settlement in such a conference as well.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Need to Preempt Security Council Initiative</p>
                        <p>We must be aware that the Soviets may take the initiative to bring us
                            into the Security Council as the defendant rather than the prosecutor.
                            Moreover, the pressure on the Secretary General to call the Security
                            Council into session under Article 99 of the Charter will also increase;
                            so far, he is restrained from acting by his own caution and our negative
                            advise. We cannot negotiate a settlement of the issue in<note n="6" xml:id="d113fn6">A note on page 13 of the source text, which begins

                                point-by-point, and returned the memorandum without comment.

                        <p>The President was cross about newspaper leaks. He said his decisions were
                            announced in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> before he made
                            them. He wanted his principal officers to enforce rules against
                            divulgences from their Departments, also to report to him the gist of
                            conversations they had with journalists on substantive matters.</p>
                        <p>He told us of his telephone conversation with <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Harold Wilson</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">See <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note> in the course of which
                            he remarked “We've got no time to be flying back and forth across the
                            Atlantic with our shirt-tails hanging out.”</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a paragraph unrelated to Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>After much exposition, the President agreed to the next steps of Vietnam
                            policy. The three salient provisions were: (1) Intensification of the
                            pacification program; (2) Measured, but effective, action below the 19th
                            parallel, against military targets in North Vietnam—to be reported to
                            the United Nations Security Council. Action will cease when aggression
                            stops; (3) U.S. will press for talks to bring an end to aggression.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> will take
                            this up with the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>It was decided to instruct <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max
                                Taylor</persName> to secure the support of the South Vietnam
                            Government to the above. The President is to explain the policy in a
                            speech next week, probably on Thursday.<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">The

                        <p>1718. The President today approved the following program for immediate
                            future actions in follow-up on decision he reported to you in Deptel
                                1653.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">
                                <ref target="#d91">Document 91</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We will intensify by all available means the program of pacification
                            within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We will execute a program of measured and limited air action jointly
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against selected military
                            targets in DRV remaining south of the 19th parallel until further
                            notice. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Our current expectation is
                            that these attacks might come about once or twice a week and involve two
                            or three targets on each day of operation. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. We will announce this policy of measured action in general terms and,
                            at the same time, we will go to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council to make clear case that aggressor is Hanoi. We will
                            also make it plain that we are ready and eager for “talks” to bring
                            aggression to an end.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe this 3-part program must be concerted with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and we currently expect to announce it
                            by Presidential statement directly after next authorized air action. We
                            believe this action should take place as early as possible next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>5. You are accordingly instructed to seek immediate GVN agreement on this
                            program. You are authorized to emphasize our conviction that
                            announcement of readiness to talk is stronger diplomatic position than
                            awaiting inevitable summons to Security Council by third parties. We
                            would hope to have appropriate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            concurrence by Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">February 15.</note> if
                            possible here.</p>
                        <p>In presenting above to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, you should
                            draw fully, as you see fit, on following arguments:</p>
                        <p>a. We are determined to continue with military actions regardless of
                            Security Council deliberations and any “talks” or negotiations that may
                            ensue, unless and until Hanoi has brought its aggression to an end. Our
                            demand would be that they cease infiltration and all forms of support
                            and also the activity they are directing in the south.</p>
                        <p>b. We consider the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                            initiative, following another strike, essential if we are to avoid being
                            faced with really damaging <pb xml:id="pg_264" n="264" facs="0296"/>initiatives by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or perhaps by
                            such powers as India, France or even the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. At an early point in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
                            Council initiative, we would expect to see calls for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to appear in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If they failed to appear, as in August, this will make
                            doubly clear that it is they who are refusing to desist, and our
                            position in pursuing military actions against the DRV would be
                            strengthened. For same reason we would now hope <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself would appear at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and work closely with US.</p>
                        <p>d. With or without Hanoi, we have every expectation that any “talks” that
                            may result from our Security Council initiative would in fact go on for
                            many weeks or perhaps months and would above all focus consistently on
                            the cessation of Hanoi's aggression as the precondition to any cessation
                            of military action against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We
                            further anticipate that any detailed discussions about any possible
                            eventual form of agreement returning to the essentials of the 1954
                            Accords would be postponed and would be subordinated to the central
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>For your private guidance, the following draft language is under
                            consideration for Presidential announcement:</p>
                        <p>“The aggression has continued. It has continued against the Vietnamese,
                            and it has continued against Americans. In support of the independence
                            of Vietnam, in the service of our nation, and in fulfillment of the
                            solemn public obligation of our nation, and in our individual and
                            collective self-defense, the Government of the United States, with the
                            Government of Vietnam, has now decided that further action must be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The actions we have agreed upon are three.</p>
                        <p>First and most important, we will continue and we will intensify still
                            further our campaign against terror and violence in South Vietnam
                            itself. The establishment of civil peace and the disarming of the
                            Communist forces are the first order of business for both our
                            Governments. Our military and police actions will be increasingly
                            energetic and effective. We will also strengthen and enlarge our efforts
                            to move forward with the peaceful development of a society set free from
                            fear. We will never make the mistake of assuming that there is any
                            substitute for victory against aggression where it shows its open
                            face—inside the borders of South Vietnam itself.</p>
                        <p>Second—and at the same time—we will carry out measured but effective
                            actions against military targets in North Vietnam. These actions will be
                            reported to the United Nations Security Council under the Provisions <pb xml:id="pg_265" n="265" facs="0297"/>of Article 51 of the United
                            Nations Charter<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">Article 51 of the U.N.
                                Charter reads as follows: “Nothing in the present Charter shall
                                impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense
                                if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations,
                                until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to
                                maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members
                                in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately
                                reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the
                                authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the
                                present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems
                                necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and
                                security.” (Charles I. Bevans, <hi rend="italic">Treaties and Other
                                    International Agreements of the United States of America,
                                    1776–1949, vol. III, p. 1165</hi>)</note>—and each such report
                            will include a full account of the continuing acts of aggression which
                            make our actions necessary. These actions will stop when the aggression
                            stops.</p>
                        <p>Third, we will press with urgency for talks designed to bring an end to
                            the aggression and its threat to peace. I have today instructed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to seek such
                            action urgently, in the Security Council of the United Nations, and if
                            that body should be hamstrung by any veto, we shall then press for talks
                            in another appropriate forum. We believe that in any such talks the
                            first object must be an end of aggression, and we believe that the
                            government in Hanoi must be brought to the conference room. Our common
                            purpose—and our only purpose—is to restore the peace and domestic
                            tranquillity which others have so savagely attacked.”</p>

                                the difficulties in forming a new government in South Vietnam.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S)</note> We have received Ref. A with deep
                            enthusiasm and will rally all our resources to carry out our part of the
                            President's program. Meanwhile we have a few preliminary <pb xml:id="pg_266" n="266" facs="0298"/>observations which we would
                            like to contribute and would welcome Department comment and
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>Our first problem here is how to obtain authentic <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence in the condition of virtual no-government
                            which exists in Saigon today. You can see from Ref. B that Quat probably
                            has a considerable way to go to form a government and, in the end, may
                            be no more successful than Vien. Hence, short of a miracle, my approach
                            tomorrow must be to “Jack” <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName>
                            in his capacity as a lame-duck Acting Premier who will probably not be
                            in the new cabinet as it seems to be taking shape. My present thought is
                            to suggest to him to have <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> present when we meet.
                            (If <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> has made real progress
                            overnight he, too, might be included.) Thus, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence would be a consensus of the Acting Prime
                            Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Commander-in-Chief, and Second Vice Prime
                            Minister of the caretaker government (and perhaps the new Prime
                            Minister-designate). In any new government, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> will be at least
                            Commander-in-Chief; <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> is
                            expected to remain Vice Prime Minister; and <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> will, we hope, have some place in the cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Because of the importance of the matter I shall raise, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> representatives may wish to consult the
                            National Security Council or the Armed Forces Council. I would not agree
                            to such consultation on ground of danger of leaks.</p>
                        <p>The presentation of this program is sure to evoke many <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> questions. One will be the degree of
                            joint U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agreement in the various
                            steps in the program. For example, will <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence be sought for Presidential announcement?
                            (As I read Ref. A, I am not to discuss proposed text of Presidential
                            announcement at this time.) Will all strikes be joint and is there a
                            reciprocal veto right for each party? Will the decision to move north of
                            the 18th parallel be taken jointly? Another question, always difficult
                            to answer among ourselves, will be the ways of determining that Hanoi
                            has brought its aggression to an end. I hope I can make clear that we
                            will insist not only that Hanoi cease actions in DRV in support of VC
                            but that Hanoi collaborate in obtaining cessations of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It will be interesting to observe the effect of our proposal on the
                            internal political situation here. I will use the occasion to emphasize
                            that a dramatic change is occurring in U.S. policy, one highly favorable
                            to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> interests but demanding a
                            parallel dramatic change of attitude on the [part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>?]. Now is the time to install the best
                            possible government as we are clearly approaching a climax in the next
                            few months. The U.S. Mission and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            will have serious problems to work out together, many of them
                            complicated matters in the field of foreign affairs where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must strengthen its [omission in the
                            source text] we need the first team and we need it fast.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_267" n="267" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>There is just a chance that the vision of possible victory may decide
                            Khanh to take over the government at this juncture. Alternatively, it
                            may create some measure of national unity which will facilitate the task
                            of Quat or of any other Prime Minister who succeeds in forming a new
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Our comments on the text of the proposed Presidential announcement and
                            the tactics related to it will follow by separate cable.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Apparently before <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had time to send the cable promised here, the

                            comments promised <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 2583:</p>
                        <p>I welcome decision for us to take initiative in bringing question into
                                <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> and to do this as early as
                            possible before others take initiative away from us. However, I am
                            concerned, both from point of view of overall negotiating tactics and
                            political considerations here, that the formulation in last paragraph of
                            Presidential announcement makes us appear impatient to get to the
                            conference table. Such eagerness, expressed at the start in the <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss>, would in my view only compound
                            pressure on US for premature negotiation. The immediate Soviet reaction
                            and that of many of our allies, for example, would be to call for
                            reconvening Geneva Conference. It seems to me instead that we should
                            seek to divert pressure for negotiation from us to Hanoi and its
                            partners.</p>
                        <p>If our reasonableness and our willingness to negotiate is played properly
                            here it could have a positive political effect, particularly if as we
                            hope we have a new civilian government headed by Quat. However, any <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269" facs="0301"/>impression of great eagerness
                            to negotiate on our part following hard on the heels of evacuation of
                            dependents is likely to be interpreted by large segments of Vietnamese
                            opinion as confirming suspicions of a US decision to pull out, despite
                            the expression of our determination to continue joint air strikes in
                            southern part of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. It particularly
                            important in my view to hold the question of talks open until we have
                            worked out a common approach with the new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I am also concerned that our announced haste to get to conference table
                            may spark upsurge in VC efforts designed to achieve the maximum
                            negotiating advantage, since Hanoi and Peking may interpret our
                            eagerness as a sign of weakness. We should remember the example of the
                            ChiCom attacks in Korea just before the signing of the armistice.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I strongly believe that the Lao and the Thai should be brought
                            on board before we seem to be inviting reopening of a Geneva Conference.
                            If we fail to do this, much of the effect of our present course of
                            action will be lost on them.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, elimination of any reference to willingness to

                                proposing instead that the announcement “make a specific proposal

                                choosing.” (Department of State, Bundy Files: Lot 85 D 240, WPB

                                <ref target="#d32">Document 32</ref>.</note> particularly paragraph
                            14 re how we state our demands on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            and nature of negotiations. Our willingness can well be brought out in
                                <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> debate. While some form of
                            negotiations is obviously our ultimate objective and <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> discussion could eventually lead to
                            such negotiations, we should in my judgment divert and focus these
                            pressures for negotiation in Hanoi, Peking and Moscow and maintain a
                            posture of firmness and determination.</p>
                        <p>I recommended following revision of final paragraph of Presidential
                            announcement:</p>
                        <p>“I have today instructed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> to seek urgently a meeting of the Security
                            Council of the United Nations to explain the reasons leading to the
                            joint decision of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and to inform the <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> members of the history of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression which makes this course of
                            action necessary. Our common purpose—and our only purpose—is to restore
                            the peace and domestic tranquility which others have so savagely
                            attacked.”</p>
                        <p>I also recommend the following additional changes in the
                            announcement:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_270" n="270" facs="0302"/>
                        <p>A) In the first paragraph, insert the following new sentence between the
                            present third and fourth sentences: “These actions will continue until
                            lawless elements are either destroyed or driven from the country.”</p>
                        <p>B) At the end of the second “action” paragraph add “and not before.”</p>

                                which is described in Document 33.</note> To facilitate the
                            discussion, I distributed the following top secret unsigned
                            memorandum:</p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposes the adoption of the
                            following program for immediate future actions:</p>
                        <p>“A. Intensification by all available means of the program of pacification
                            within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“B. Execution of a joint <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US program
                            of measured and limited air action against selected military targets in
                            the southern part of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Air strikes
                            under this program will be jointly planned and agreed.</p>
                        <p>“C. Announcement of this policy of measured action in general terms and
                            presentation to the United Nations Security Council of the <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0303"/>case against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as the aggressor, accompanied by an
                            indication of readiness to discuss ways of bringing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression to an end.”</p>
                        <p>Following the guidance contained in reftels, I then proceeded to comment
                            on each one of the foregoing three points. With regard to the
                            intensification of pacification, I noted the danger both in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and in the US that this air program
                            would be regarded as a cheap and easy way out of the pacification
                            problems in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and that it behooves
                            both parties to allay this misapprehension by intensified attention to
                            pacification and by strong statements to the people and the armed forces
                            of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> that the in-country program must
                            be carried forward with increasing vigor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> agreed with this
                            evaluation but cited the unspectacular nature of pacification operations
                            and the requirement to keep a strong central reserve of military units
                            to cope with possible major attacks by VC on provincial centers. He
                            asked my opinion about the need for a partial mobilization, to which I
                            replied that now was the time to be sure that all national resources
                            were brought into play as we appeared to be moving toward some kind of
                            climax.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point, I stressed that on our side we would
                            like to impart a vigorous rhythm to the operations against the North but
                            that much would depend upon the ability of the Vietnamese Government to
                            maintain its end. There would be much more in the program than the
                            military aspects; in particular, there would be a need for a prompt
                            strengthening of the foreign office, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation and information activities. Overall, there
                            was the pressing need for a strong, permanent government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> then asked what we meant
                            by the phrase “selected military targets in the southern part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>”? I explained that it meant the
                            area in which we had conducted our recent strikes and would extend over,
                            at least, as much of south <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as could
                            be reached with safety by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>. I then
                            made the point that, not covered by this proposed agreement, were the US
                            air operations in Laos, the 34–A program which should continue to be
                            conducted as at present, and any <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> operations of the nature of the Tonkin Gulf affair.
                            I explained that the initial limitation of strikes to this southern part
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would not necessarily be
                            permanent as, in the course, we would probably want to edge north to
                            give signals to Hanoi of increasing danger.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of point three, the approach to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I explained the need for preemptive action and for
                            taking the initiative from those countries who might wish to call us
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> bar as the guilty party. It
                            was most important to present the strongest possible case against Hanoi
                            and we must work closely together [to] this end. I emphasized that we
                            expected to continue air strikes throughout the duration of the
                            discussions which might last several months. I closed with a summary of
                            our objectives which are to oblige Hanoi to cease infiltration and all
                            forms of <pb xml:id="pg_272" n="272" facs="0304"/>support of VC and to
                            collaborate in obtaining cessation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            insurgency.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> consulted briefly and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> indicated that they were
                            completely in accord with the three-point program. I indicated that I
                            would report <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Before we broke up, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            expressed concern over the statements appearing in the world press which
                            suggested that our recent air strikes had been in retaliation solely for
                            US losses on US bases and indicated that this kind of talk caused him
                            trouble in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. I told him that we
                            appreciated his difficulty and would also like to stress the mutuality
                            of our defensive actions. I reiterated, as I had in my meeting with
                            Prime Minister Huong on January 23, that retaliation should take place
                            whether the victims were Vietnamese, US nationals or both. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s comment is a reminder to us
                            that in all government statements we should recognize the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> partnership and the mutual
                            responsibility to protect the nationals of both countries.</p>
                        <p>Later when I queried <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            privately as to whether he has considered bringing Quat into the meeting
                            per our suggestion, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            replied that it would have been improper to include <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> since he was not officially
                            installed as Prime Minister. However, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said he would bring <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> up to date immediately following <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s investiture. Earlier we had
                            informed <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> without mentioning
                            subject of meeting that we would suggest to <persName corresp="#p_OANH1">Oanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            that he participate but of course decision rested with them.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I wished to talk to him a little further about
                            the situation in Viet-Nam, I said we were convinced and, in fact, <pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0305"/>had evidence that the Viet-Cong
                            were controlled from Hanoi and we were convinced that the recent
                            escalation had been deliberately triggered by Hanoi. I said we did not
                            have evidence that Peking had ordered the recent increase in activity
                            and the outrages against our people, but since it was only Peking that
                            stood to gain, we could assume that they were involved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if this was a
                            message from the President, and I replied that the President had asked
                            me to speak to him but had not instructed me specifically what to say,
                            but I thought I was reflecting his thinking. When he asked whether this
                            was a reply to the message from his Government<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d82fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    82</ref>.</note> or whether there would be a separate
                            communication, I said I frankly did not know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had no
                            instructions from his Government and could only give me his personal
                            views. He said that not only he but the members of his staff had reacted
                            very strongly at our action in bombing North Viet-Nam, which they
                            thought was deliberately related to the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit. He could assume that reactions in the
                            Soviet Union were similar.</p>
                        <p>I again assured him that when we had learned of the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> visit, we had taken a number of
                            steps, including calling off a DeSoto patrol in order not to, in any
                            way, embarrass Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. It
                            was not we, but the other side that had started these new developments.
                            When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said we could have
                            taken some other action than the bombing of the country which his Prime
                            Minister was visiting, I asked him to put himself in our place. I said,
                            for example, that if the West Germans had been conducting operations in
                            East Germany similar to those which North Viet-Nam was conducting in
                            South Viet-Nam and that during a visit of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to West Germany a lot of Soviet
                            personnel in East Germany had been blown up in a sneak attack, what
                            would they have done? He said I can assure you we would not have bombed
                            West Germany.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> several times asked to
                            know what the course we had embarked upon was leading to and what our
                            ultimate objectives were. I said our objective was to get out of South
                            Viet-Nam. I pointed out that we had reached a settlement of a similar
                            problem in Laos and that we had actually withdrawn our troops. His
                            Government had complained about a few alleged technical violations but
                            the fact was that we had really carried out the agreement. The other
                            side had not and had prevented any international machinery from
                            operating effectively. I said we would like to see this agreement
                            effectively implemented.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he still did not
                            understand what we were driving at. From the Soviet point of view, we
                            had intervened to put down an indigenous <pb xml:id="pg_274" n="274" facs="0306"/>movement which was very strong and the fact that even
                            if one accepted our statements of some infiltrators from the North, the
                            South Vietnamese had some three hundred thousand men, in addition to the
                            sizeable American forces, engaged, and they were unable to put down the
                            rebellion, which showed that it was basically an indigenous movement. He
                            said that simply for the sake of argument, if one accepted our
                            statements about the North Vietnamese role, what would happen if they
                            agreed to stop any intervention and did so? There would continue to be
                            incidents and he wondered what he would do then.</p>
                        <p>I said that we had firm evidence of the command and control of these
                            operations by Hanoi and said we could produce our evidence. I did not
                            dispute that there was some indigenous rebel activity but said that
                            after the Geneva Accords the North Vietnamese had left personnel in
                            South Viet-Nam to carry on these operations and had brought in tens of
                            thousands from the North after the Accords. These people were highly
                            trained and would go into villages and force the villagers to supply
                            them with personnel under threat of destroying the village. If the
                            village did not comply, they carried out their threats.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected that there
                            was plenty of evidence of the South Vietnamese Government using similar
                            methods. I went on to say that if Hanoi stopped its intervention and
                            withdrew its people, we would know about this and in this event we were
                            sure that the situation could be stabilized. I said it was important to
                            realize that North Viet-Nam was trying to take over South Viet-Nam but
                            we were not endeavoring to take over the North. I said we considered our
                            actions defensive.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that

                                negotiations<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">Regarding the Indian

                            Department had said no. He said that I knew his country and must know
                            how they were reacting and the possibility that they would become
                            involved. He asked if it were true, as he had inferred from press
                            articles, that there had been some negotiations started indirectly
                            between us and Hanoi. I replied that I had not heard of any.</p>
                        <p>In discussing Soviet/American relations, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Government had made
                            several gestures toward the improvement of relations, not that they felt
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> needed them,
                            but they were genuine. He emphasized that contrary to press statements,
                            the Soviet Government was not in a position of having any need to
                            improve relations, although they thought this was in the mutual interest
                            of both countries. He said it was not a question of desiring to worsen
                            them, but <pb xml:id="pg_275" n="275" facs="0307"/>was simply one of
                            fact that if our present policy continued, our relations would be
                            adversely affected. I said I could recognize this fact but it seemed to
                            me they were attempting to use the threat of worsening relations as a
                            deliberate move to affect the Vietnamese situation. I pointed out that
                            after the Cuban affair we had been able quickly to resume our progress
                            in bettering our relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that he had
                            been speaking personally and I again said that I was simply trying, at
                            the direction of the President, to give him some understanding of the
                            way we looked at the problem.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you suggested after we talked on the phone Saturday,<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">February 13. </note> here are my three points in
                            writing. </p>
                        <p>1. The military weight of infiltration. In addition to documenting the
                            fact of infiltration and its illegality in terms of the commitments of
                            1954 and 1962, it is important to put into perspective its straight
                            military significance. All guerrilla wars are marked by a vast
                            disproportion between the number of guerrillas and the number of
                            government troops required to control or defeat them. This disproportion
                            stems from the fact that the guerrillas' job is to harass and to
                            destroy; the government's job is to defend a living society. Although
                            the figures vary, the average proportion is ten to one (derived from
                            data on Algeria, Naga, the Irish Rebellion, the French war in Indochina,
                            the present war in South Viet Nam, Malaysia, and the Philippines). This
                            means that by infiltrating (say) 500 to 1,000 men a month the North
                            Vietnamese are throwing into battle the equivalent of 5–10,000 per month
                            so far as the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government is
                            concerned. This is an <pb xml:id="pg_276" n="276" facs="0308"/>extremely
                            heavy weight to bear for the South Vietnamese. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are, in effect, crossing the border each
                            month with a division. In fact, none of the postwar guerrilla conflicts
                            has been won with an open frontier. The frontiers were closed, or
                            virtually closed, in the Philippines and in Malaya. The Greek civil war
                            was won only after <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> closed the
                            Yugoslav frontiers when he split with Stalin. (This whole point is
                            elaborated in more detail, including the critical morale role of an open
                            frontier in my June 6, 1954,<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Not found.
                            </note> memo which is available to you.) </p>
                        <p>2. The Politics of South Viet Nam. In the face of this almost
                            insupportable military burden, the political and military performance of
                            the South Vietnamese has been remarkable. Militarily, despite very heavy
                            casualties, the regular army has maintained its unity. There has been no
                            going over to the enemy of substantial units with their officers, as was
                            the case in the guerrilla war in China; although this is the critical
                            index to watch, and the defection of lesser units is worrying. The civil
                            guard and self-defense corps have borne very heavy casualties, continue
                            to fight and inflict heavy casualties. Politically we must remember that
                            South Viet Nam has had little time to develop a modern national
                            political life. It was a colony living in an environment of war since
                            1940. It was not permitted in colonial times, nor has it had the
                            possibility in the past decade, to learn how to develop responsible
                            democratic politics. Neither under <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> nor since his departure has there been an organized
                            political forum in which men could debate, compromise, and come to
                            majority consensus in ways which give minorities a sense of confidence
                            that their view can continue to be heard and there are orderly methods
                            for enlarging their influence and powers. Much of the turbulence we have
                            seen in Viet Nam in recent months reflects a desire of new, younger
                            groups in the society to participate in the political process. It will
                            take time for them to find how to do this while preserving their
                            independence and fighting a tough war. Nevertheless, the fact is that
                            none of the major political elements in the equation of Vietnamese
                            politics wishes to turn the country over to Hanoi (the army, the
                            Buddhists, the Catholics, the Cao Dai, etc.).</p>
                        <p>3. Neither military nor politically, therefore, have we reason for
                            despair. The decisive element is infiltration and direction of the war
                            from the north. There is every reason to believe that, if these people
                            come to feel that the weight of the northern element is lifted from
                            them, they will see it through within their country, as did the
                            government forces in Greece, Malaya, and the Philippines. Moreover,
                            there is reason to believe that the political imperatives of fighting
                            and winning a guerrilla war can prove to be a constructive process in
                            developing an effective modern government that links urban and rural
                            life. The old Malayan war room, built to map rural insurrection, now
                            maps village development programs. It is easy to forget that, at the
                            time the Truman Doctrine was promulgated, <pb xml:id="pg_277" n="277" facs="0309"/>there was widespread protest in the United States
                            against our supporting a dictatorial reactionary Greek government. It is
                            easy to forget that there was an endless sequence of weak Greek
                            governments during the prosecution of the guerrilla war, with the
                            military alone a relatively solid element. It is easy to forget that at
                            critical periods in Greece, Malaya, and the Philippines, it was unsafe
                            to venture outside the capital cities; and there were obvious Communist
                            assets operating within the capital cities. If our military and
                            diplomatic weight can be applied in such a way as to eliminate the heavy
                            and illegal northern element in the war, we can look forward with
                            confidence to the emergence, despite many vicissitudes, of a viable,
                            modernizing nation in South Viet Nam. </p>
                        <p>4. Ground Forces on Both Sides and Negotiation. Hanoi has not been
                            behaving as we might think it should behave. We have given it grounds to
                            believe that, if they proceed quietly with infiltration, we would, de
                            facto, accept that condition for the war, aside from some minor
                            harassment in Laos itself. The Tonkin Gulf incident was not linked to
                            infiltration but to our freedom of the seas. Why have they chosen to
                            affront us directly? Why are they pressing so hard when it seems wholly
                            possible for them, via infiltration, to shift the military proportions
                            in such a way as to confront the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            with attrition beyond its capacity for replacement? Why do they appear
                            to be forcing our hand when the chances, from our perspective, look good
                            for so discouraging the South Vietnamese about their prospects that the
                            political leadership (including the army) might prefer some negotiation,
                            from a weak position, to the endless pursuit of a stalemated war? </p>
                        <p>I do not know the answers; but it may be that there are pressures working
                            on them to make the best deal they can in a negotiation fairly soon.
                            These could arise because they are hurting more than we think; because
                            our relative position looks stronger to them than it does to us; because
                            there is a split in Hanoi related to the Sino-Soviet split; or to
                            something else. In any case, if they are driving towards the most
                            advantageous position in a negotiation fairly soon, they will be
                            strongly tempted to play their asset (ground forces strength) just as we
                            are led to bring into negotiating play our asset (naval and air
                            power).</p>
                        <p>I conclude, therefore, that we must be extremly alert to a land grab,
                            perhaps in the Laos corridor, from which they would negotiate from a
                            position of increased relative strength; and I would commend to us
                            consideration of a preemptive ground force move in that area and on the
                            soil of South Viet Nam, which would also enhance our strength in a
                            negotiating situation. A ground force can sit quietly during a
                            conference until it is negotiated out for something substantive. It will
                            be extremely difficult for us, during a negotiation, to make effective
                            use of our air and naval <pb xml:id="pg_278" n="278" facs="0310"/>power
                            because (except sea blockade of Haiphong) it is sanguinary; although we
                            may have to have the nerve and will to use air and naval strikes to make
                            them accept terms minimally compatible with our interests. </p>

                        <p>1. Saigon 2588<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">
                                <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>. </note> and Bangkok

                            strenuously that any expressed willingness to talk would raise serious
                            problems in both countries, and could well cause doubts about our
                            firmness. At the very least, this would point to adequate time to
                            consult fully with both governments, and probably also with the Lao.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the argument for declaring our willingness to talk
                            remains very strong. Once we have made our case in the Security Council,
                            there is a terribly high probability that some one will generate a
                            resolution calling for discussion among the interested powers on how to
                            achieve cessation of what the Indian Declaration<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">Apparently a reference to the Indian Government's
                                public statement of February 8, expressing its “grave concern” over
                                the developments in Vietnam and calling for a “Geneva-type
                                conference.” The Indian Ambassador had called on Acting Secretary of

                            own activity against the north, probably with a cease-fire in the south
                            and withdrawal of American personnel from the south also thrown up as
                            part of the agenda. There remains great merit in the idea that getting
                            into “preliminary discussions” on a seven-power basis would give us a
                            strong lightning rod against pressures for an immediate conference and
                            would permit us to continue our actions during the prolonged period that
                            such preliminary discussions would take.</p>
                        <p>As I see it this is the key question. If we decide to continue with
                            Saturday's script,<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">Apparently a reference to
                                the plan agreed on Saturday, February 13, at the working level and
                                then approved by the President on February 13. See <ref target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> we must recognize that
                            we have not in fact cleared this in Saigon—or Bangkok, or Vientiane—and
                            that failure to understand our motives and purposes in these quarters
                            could have very serious implications. Saigon in particular is an
                            absolute must, since we must have the Vietnamese with us in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and not appear to be jumping ahead of
                            them down what can be construed as a negotiating track. </p>
                        <p>2. Allied Consultation. If we envisage a sequence comprising an
                            additional strike, a public statement within 24–48 hours thereafter, and
                            resort to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in another 2–3 days
                            thereafter—(and foreshadowed by the statement), we must consider
                            carefully just when and how fully we talk to our allies. I divide the
                            problem as follows.</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, Thailand, and Laos: full
                            consultation and clearance.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada:
                            full consultation, but with the difference that clearance can be
                            expected to be fairly automatic. </p>
                        <p>c. Japan, Philippines, India, and perhaps France: slightly less full
                            consultation, designed to keep Japan and the Philippines calm and to
                            make India and France at least understand what we are doing. </p>
                        <p>d. Soviet Union: This too is a special case, and it might be what we
                            would wish to tell them only at once after the next action and just
                            before our public announcement. </p>
                        <p>e. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>: This too is a special
                            case, and I assume you have talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CLEVELAND1">Cleveland</persName> about the possibility
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>, unless forewarned,
                            may at some time state publicly that he has been working on an avenue to
                            Hanoi, that Hanoi has agreed (I don't personally know what he means by
                            this) and that we have declined to go ahead.<note n="7" xml:id="d122fn7">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s

                        </p>
                        <p>As to timing, I would myself be inclined to state that categories a and b
                            above should be fully covered before we make the strike, and that
                            category c might also be considered for such treatment; d and e might
                            wait until the day between the strike and the announcement.</p>
                        <p>3. Nature and Timing of Operations. This has not been fully thought
                            through, and I have the feeling that the Pentagon still thinks in terms
                            of larger single operations, and more operations in any one strike, than
                            may <pb xml:id="pg_280" n="280" facs="0312"/>be wise, particularly
                            during the time that we are actually presenting our case to the world

                            came up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                            this morning,<note n="9" xml:id="d122fn9">No record of this conversation
                                has been found. </note> and my own conclusion is that we could hold
                            it out of the initial <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presentation, in
                            order to develop it later in the preliminary discussions as a prelude to
                            radio silence as one form of compliance. </p>
                        <p>b. We do not yet have an exact formulation of the conditions we would set
                            as essential to the convening of a conference. My own view is that at
                            the outset we should insist on a cessation of infiltration and of
                            activity in the south in which the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            has a hand. However, all of us can see that this would be a very
                            difficult thing to verify for the first part, and practically impossible
                            for the second. We may find ourselves moving toward a trend that would
                            set the cessation of infiltration against the cessation of our attacks
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and this needs careful
                            weighing as we go along. A cease-fire is another thorny issue, since it
                            would not be advantageous in the south, as we now see it, unless we had
                            freedom of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces movement
                            throughout areas where there is still nominal <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presence.</p>
                        <p>The complexity and difficulty of these issues argue strongly for not
                            seeking to litigate them in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
                            this in turn points strongly in the direction of initiating, or
                            accepting, a proposal for early, “preliminary discussions” to work on
                            these issues. </p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>” but “happy about
                                air attacks” and “dependent removal.” (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Memos to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Vol. VIII) </note> During the past
                            week a great deal of effort was expended in trying to form a new
                            government but, unfortunately, much of this effort came to naught. By
                            mid-week, it appeared that Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> would be successful but, after
                            completing his entire slate except for the Minister of Interior, he
                            ultimately failed. While there are several versions as to the cause of
                            his failure, it is reasonably clear that <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>,
                            supported probably by some of the other generals, could not reach
                            agreement as to <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName>'s power and
                            authority as Prime Minister. Also, we understand that at some point
                                <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and the Buddhist
                            Institute leaders made it known that they would never go along with a
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> government. </p>
                        <p>Only this morning the Armed Forces Council announced that it had chosen
                                <persName corresp="#p_PKS1">Phan Khac Suu</persName> to stay on as
                            Chief of State and had named Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PHQ1">Phan Huy
                                Quat</persName> as Prime Minister. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is supposed to announce his government momentarily.
                            We know Dr. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> reasonably well
                            from his previous tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> Government. We think well of
                            him as an individual but feel he will face monumental problems. As in
                            the case of any Prime Minister, his relations with the armed forces and
                            the Buddhist Institute will be critical. In many quarters, he is
                            suspected of being pro-Institute since <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName> is known to have viewed him as Prime Ministerial
                            timber. Regardless of whether he is <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                Quang</persName>'s candidate or not at the moment, in the short or
                            long run the Institute leaders are likely to put demands upon him which
                            he will find difficult to accept. Then the question will be whether Quat
                            can retain the support of the military in resisting the Buddhists. In
                            the meantime, we expect to do the best we can to develop effective
                            working relations with his government and exploit on the governmental
                            front the stimulus resulting from the air attacks against North
                            Viet-Nam. </p>
                        <p>These air attacks have been greeted with enthusiasm by all of my military
                            contacts and indeed all articulate, urban Vietnamese opinion appears to
                            be favorable to them and to sense a turning point of some kind in the
                            long war. Excitement generated by them has allowed our dependent
                            evacuation to proceed with little public comment and a degree of public
                            understanding. As of noon today, February 16, we have evacuated <pb xml:id="pg_282" n="282" facs="0314"/>1,456 of our total 1,610. We
                            can easily complete the evacuation within the ten days which you
                            authorized except for a few medical cases which cannot be moved and
                            alien wives of U.S. Government personnel who have passport problems. The
                            evacuation has gone very smoothly with minimum discomfort to the
                            evacuees. We all are very grateful to you for having allowed us to
                            follow this orderly pattern. </p>
                        <p>The week was not a satisfactory one from the point of view of military
                            action. Although over 500 Viet Cong were killed and about 130 captured,
                            government forces lost over 1,000 weapons. Many of those losses occurred
                            in Binh Dinh Province where the security situation has been steadily
                            deteriorating. The Viet Cong are consolidating their control in four
                            districts of the province while government control is limited to the
                            immediate vicinity of district capitals. The government has ordered
                            reinforcements to the area and a major U.S. advisory effort is under
                            way. The basic cause for the retrogression is the low density of
                            available troops in a province which is both large and populous. We can
                            hope to do little more than stabilize in Binh Dinh until additional
                            military, paramilitary and police forces authorized for 1965 are in
                            place.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I have been brooding about our discussion of yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">See <ref target="#d122fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    122</ref>.</note> and I think I am beginning to understand where
                            the problem is. </p>
                        <p>1. I think that some of us—perhaps mostly me—have been confusing two
                            questions. One is the firmness of your own decision to order continuing
                                <pb xml:id="pg_283" n="283" facs="0315"/>action; the other is the
                            wisdom of a public declaration of that policy by you. Let me give you a
                            little background and a recommendation.</p>
                        <p>2. Rightly or wrongly, those of us who favor continuing military action
                            against the North do see it as a major watershed decision. However much
                            it is based on continuing aggression in the South (as it should be), it
                            amounts to a U.S. decision to mount continuing pressure against Hanoi by
                            use of our air and naval superiority. This is not the same, in
                            operational terms, as what we did last August. And it is not the same as
                            a policy of episodic retaliation for particular attacks against large
                            numbers of Americans. It is very different indeed, and the difference is
                            just what we are counting on as the one possible means of turning around
                            a desperate situation which has been heading toward a disastrous U.S.
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>3. Precisely because this program represents a major operational change
                            and because we have waited many months to put it into effect, there is a
                            deep-seated need for assurance that the decision has in fact been taken.
                            When you were out of the room yesterday, Bob McNamara repeatedly stated
                            that he simply has to know what the policy is so that he can make his
                            military plans and give his military orders. This certainly is equally
                            essential if we are to get the necessary political effects in Saigon. If
                            we limit ourselves to reprisals for spectaculars like Pleiku and Qui
                            Nhon, we leave the initiative in the hands of the Communists and we can
                            expect no good result.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus it seems essential to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>—and to me too—that there be an absolutely firm
                            and clear internal decision of the U.S. Government and that this
                            decision be known and understood by enough people to permit its orderly
                            execution. That is one side of the problem.</p>
                        <p>5. The other side of the problem, as I understand it, is that you do not
                            want to give a loud public signal of a major change in policy right now.
                            This is a position which makes a lot of sense on a lot of grounds. When
                            I talked to <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot Lodge</persName>
                            yesterday, he told me that he had taped a statement for <persName corresp="#p_GD1">Dave Garroway</persName>'s “Today” show in which he
                            stoutly and firmly supported your decision not to make loud public
                            statements. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> believes, as
                            you know, that action speaks louder than words in this field. <persName corresp="#p_WJR1">Russ Wiggins</persName> of the Post has just
                            called me to try to make a luncheon date (I refused), and in the course
                            of listening to him I learned that he too thinks it is right to act
                            against the North and equally right not to boast about it, because such
                            boasting only makes life harder for the Communists. Tommy Thompson also
                            argues the virtue of not rubbing the Communist nose in this mess, at
                            least at your level.</p>
                        <p>6. So in terms of public statement, I fully understand the forces which
                            were leading you yesterday to suggest that any public comments might be
                            best handled by the Secretary of State and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. Most of the need for public
                            utterance which led <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill Moyers</persName>
                            and me to urge a Presidential speech last week can be met just as well
                            by the Secretary, <pb xml:id="pg_284" n="284" facs="0316"/>and there is
                            real gain in keeping you out of the immediate military aspect of the
                            matter at this stage.</p>
                        <p>7. Thus I think it is possible to reconcile the need for a clear decision
                            within the Government with a need to avoid excessive public noise—by a
                            policy of Presidential decision and Secretarial exposition.</p>
                        <p>8. That leaves us only one problem: which is communication with our
                            Allies. What we tell them is not likely to stay tightly secret, and yet
                            I think it is crucial that they not feel left out or uninformed. In
                            different ways this is as important for London as for Saigon, for Ottawa
                            as for New Delhi, for Bonn as for Tokyo, for Paris as for Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>9. My solution to this problem would be to give a clear account of our
                            private thinking, with appropriate emphasis for each capital, but
                            without any indication of the size and frequency of planned actions,
                            other than to say that they will be limited and fitting, and that any
                            further escalation will be the fault of the enemy. </p>

                            following language:</p>

                                interpolation to revise the sentence as follows: “We will respond to
                                and deter aggression by the execution of a joint <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US program of measured and limited

                        <p>“C. Announcement of this policy of measured action in general terms and
                            presentation to the United Nations Security Council of the case against

                            an indication of readiness to discuss ways of bringing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression to an end.”</p>
                        <p>11. In summary, what I think we need is internal clarity about the
                            importance and scope of the decisions you are taking, and as much public
                            calm and coolness as possible. For these purposes,
                                <persName>Rusk</persName> is the ideal spokesman for policy, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> the ideal defender
                            and explainer (which means, incidentally, that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> probably should not undertake
                            a TV program proving that Hanoi is the aggressor—this should be

                        <p>1. We spoke yesterday about the need to tie down just what we might be
                            able to live with in the way of compliance by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> with various gradations of “leaving
                            their neighbors alone.”</p>
                        <p>2. The Defense Department has done a very good outline on the “<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> compliance problem.” But the Defense
                                memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">This undated paper was sent
                                as an attachment to a note of February 17 from <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, in which <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName> wrote that the Defense paper referred to in

                                covering note are ibid.</note> is really addressed to the longer
                            range problem with which we would be faced in attending a peace
                            conference, negotiating a peace settlement for Viet-Nam, and
                            establishing international machinery to ensure compliance.</p>
                        <p>3. More immediately, whether or not we get into the Security Council as
                            such, any “political track” requires us to be very clear in our own
                            minds about:</p>
                        <p>a. How much of a stand-down by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> we
                            would insist on as a pre-condition to talks about the longer range
                            problem? and </p>
                        <p>b. How much of a stand-down we would be prepared to live with ourselves
                            as the quid pro quo?</p>
                        <p>4. The following problems, among others, seem to be crucial. I hope that
                            in the discussions with Defense they can be clarified:</p>
                        <p>a. We presumably want a halt to the infiltration. But how will we know
                            that the infiltration is halted without some international inspectors on
                            the ground? To discuss international inspectors as part of a
                            precondition for a peace conference would stall progress toward peace
                            talks. (If as things work out we want to stall talks for a while, this
                            would be a credible way to do it.)</p>
                        <p>b. Can we use, in the pre-condition phase, the concept of radio silence?
                            In this case the “inspection” would presumably be our national
                            capabilities, rather than any international arrangement. There is,
                            however, <pb xml:id="pg_286" n="286" facs="0318"/>precedent, in 1958 in
                            Lebanon, for international (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>)
                            monitoring of a military radio system as part of a peacekeeping
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>c. Do we want a cease-fire in South Vietnam? The answer presumably
                            depends on the definition of “cease-fire”.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand, “cease-fire” could simply mean a stand-still while the
                            talks go on. But if such a stand-still enables the Liberation Front to
                            consolidate its political control in the areas effectively held by the
                            Viet Cong, this would build into the peace talks an incentive for the
                            Communists to stall, since the cease-fire would be working to their
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if “cease-fire” is taken to include the idea that the
                            Saigon Government could “pacify” the Viet Cong areas during the
                            cease-fire, that would be taken by most people as a frivolous proposal,
                            since it would be a kind of “one-sided cease-fire”. We cannot, after
                            all, expect to accomplish by political negotiation a great advance over
                            what we can accomplish by military means. If the South Vietnamese army
                            with our American advisers cannot pacify the country-side, it is
                            unlikely that the State Department or our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation will succeed in doing so in a Security
                            Council resolution or at the pre-conference table.</p>
                        <p>The definition of “cease-fire” will therefore have to be somewhere in
                            between a “one-sided cease-fire” and a simple stand-still order equally
                            applicable to both sides.</p>
                        <p>d. Under what conditions would we agree to stop bombing the North—or,
                            without an agreement, stop bombing de facto? Can we agree to stop the
                            bombing only in return for a stoppage of the infiltration, leaving the
                            Viet Cong free to continue attacks (including attacks on American
                            installations) in South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>5. These are all questions, and are not intended to imply the answers.
                            But we clearly need to know what we think the answers are before we get
                            into public negotiations—in or out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—on the issue of how the shooting can be stopped and the
                            talking begun.</p>
                        <p>6. One alternative we should certainly consider is to start the talking
                            while the shooting (and periodic bombing) continues. Unless we can get a
                            very considerable stand-down by Hanoi and the Viet Cong—perhaps
                            including some actual withdrawal of North Vietnamese from South Viet-Nam
                            as an earnest of good intentions—there may be advantages to talking
                            about a cease-fire but not actually to arrive at one before the peace
                            talks begin. Under these conditions, the “pre-conference” stage (with a
                            strictly limited number of countries involved) would probably turn out
                            to be 90 percent of the peace talks; a “Geneva Conference” could be
                            called merely to ratify more or less permanent arrangements that had
                            already been agreed to at the “pre-conference”, spurred by continuation
                            of sporadic fighting and bombing.</p>

                            and assurances Hanoi will require if it is to undergo the agony of our
                            bombardment. There is already evidence that Peiping is stepping back
                            from giving the assurances of support that Hanoi seeks. Hanoi is
                            unquestionably troubled over this; and, although Hanoi will not thereby
                            throw in the sponge, Hanoi will obviously be rendered more willing to
                            look for some compromise that would be more acceptable from our
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Phase II operations will intensify international (and even US)
                            pressures for negotiations. As you often say, the trick is to keep these
                            pressures under control. Hence, I conclude:</p>
                        <p>1. Phase II operations must not be too intense or frequent; else
                            negotiating pressures become unmanageable and we find ourselves
                            negotiating before Hanoi has fully sensed the implications of its
                            “lonely” position, that is, before Hanoi becomes fully aware of
                            Peiping's unwillingness to make the total commitment of support that
                            Hanoi seeks.</p>
                        <p>2. Also, if we step up the attacks too far, we are more likely to drive
                            North Viet-Nam into widespread attacks against South Viet-Nam either
                            with organized <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces or, as is
                            more likely, by massive infiltration to the south.</p>
                        <p>3. We should not relieve the ChiComs of any fear they might already have
                            that we will go after their air bases, etc., in the event that their air
                            force attacked ours or that they would have any privileged sanctuary
                            position in the event they became too involved in the Vietnamese
                            fighting. This would have to be done quietly. Public declarations on the
                            subject are out.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The public problem on Viet-Nam currently breaks down into two problems:
                            One, the need for some public statement, either on a Presidential or
                            Secretarial level, that reiterates the United States stake in Viet-Nam
                            and sets the tone for public discussion in this country. Two, the more
                            intricate, detailed and searching investigation by the press of future
                            U.S. aims and actions. These questions are both legitimate and pressing,
                            but at the moment they reflect journalistic rather than public
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>Within government the tendency so far is to brush aside the general
                            public statement on the excuse that it cannot include all the details
                            demanded by the press. This argument is not valid.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Public Statement</p>
                        <p>A public statement, either Presidential or on a high State Department
                            level, should spell out some of the guidelines which will motivate our
                            future actions in Viet-Nam. But this look into the future need not form
                            the bulk of such a statement.</p>
                        <p>Instead, the statement should be dominated by a simple, direct
                            restatement of U.S. policy. This restatement should outline the reasons
                            why we are in South Viet-Nam, the nature of guerrilla warfare, the
                            importance of the Pacific area to the United States, the alternatives
                            that the U.S. faces and the consequences for both the U.S. and the free
                            world that would occur if the United States did not carry out its
                            commitment in Asia.</p>
                        <p>To people dealing closely with the problem this is old-hat, even boring
                            stuff. But it would not be to the American public.</p>
                        <p>The argument that we have said all this before—and therefore should not
                            repeat ourselves—is equally invalid. The rationale for our actions
                            during the past few weeks was almost entirely dropped from most of the
                            stories that appeared after the first day of bombings. In ninety percent
                            of the stories, the reasons for our actions fell victim to the more
                            dramatic factual news of bombings, Americans wounded, statements,
                            threats and counter threats.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_289" n="289" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>People, I am convinced, have lost sight of many of the past statements
                            (and bits of statements) made in the past on Viet-Nam by the President
                            and the Secretary. Our own two White House statements in the last ten
                                days<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">For the White House statements of
                                February 7 and 11, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, pp. 238–239 and
                                290.</note> shifted emphasis without explanation. Almost no one
                            remembers what the accords of 1954 and 1962 were all about, the
                            rationale upon which they were based, or their applicability to the
                            present situation.</p>
                        <p>Someone, therefore, should take them back through the essentials of our
                            policy—back through the accords, back through our mounting involvement
                            as this new kind of warfare unfolded, back through our countless
                            statements that we want no bases and no territory for ourselves. We
                            should remind the public that a free Viet-Nam is worth the risks, both
                            because of our obligations to the Vietnamese and to ourselves.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough simply to say that we are in Viet-Nam because Ike got us
                            there or because the Vietnamese have asked us in, although both facts
                            should be recalled.</p>
                        <p>Such a statement should end up by a clear declaration that what we seek
                            is peace and as clear a statement as possible as to what we expect from
                            the other side in order to gain that peace.</p>
                        <p>Such a statement will reassure the country, give it a common starting
                            point to judge future U.S. actions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Questions of the Press</p>
                        <p>It will not, however, satisfy many of the questions being asked by the
                            press such as those listed below. Many of them are currently
                            unanswerable.</p>
                        <p>1. What is our objective in bombing the North? </p>
                        <p>— Is it unconditional surrender? </p>
                        <p>— Is it to drive the Viet Cong out of South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>— Is it a cease-fire?</p>
                        <p>— Is it negotiations: if so with whom, what conditions, how arranged? </p>
                        <p>2. Why do we think the Viet Cong will give up if we bomb the North? </p>
                        <p>(Granted they are supplied and directed from Hanoi, but we acknowledge
                            they have a strong local base and large measure of independence.)</p>
                        <p>3. Under what circumstances will we continue to bomb the North?</p>
                        <p>—only if major attacks on U.S. facilities continue? (i.e., tit-for-tat:
                            theme of February 8 statement)</p>
                        <p>—at our discretion irrespective of specific attacks on U.S. personnel or
                            installations? (White House statement of February 11)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_290" n="290" facs="0322"/>
                        <p>4. What are we doing to prevent situation from returning to wasting
                            guerrilla war that we haven't been able to win, with continuation of
                            political instability in Saigon?</p>
                        <p>5. Any efforts going on to edge confrontation onto political track? What
                            are circumstances under which we would talk to Hanoi, to Peiking, to
                            South Viet-Nam National Liberation Front and/or Viet Cong
                            leadership?</p>
                        <p>If we won't talk do we have any objective other than complete withdrawal
                            of Viet Cong to north of 17th Parallel?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Either the President or you should make a statement setting forth the
                            fundamentals of our position and relating recent events to those
                            fundamentals. If you hold a press conference you must be prepared to
                            open with a full statement on Viet-Nam, since many of the questions you
                            will get are unanswerable—or better left unanswered.</p>

                        <p>Difference between L.B.J. &amp; R.S.M. </p>
                        <p>[LBJ]: Give some more thought to what is likely to flow? How many people
                            are going to be on board? Do you want to talk to predecessors? I'm going
                            to talk to some folks outside? I don't want it to be influential on
                            anyone—sure it's not. We must be prepared 1) to grant any request for $
                            and pacification, 2) possible targets in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, 3) make evident—if there is any doubt—to Commies
                            &amp; to SVnese &amp; to our own people. But we can strike
                            measurably and prudently in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I think that is much more necessary by desperate condition of Gov't. It
                            may be in adversity you can minimize their differences.</p>
                        <p>We have done it in less spectacular ways. Killing 16000, in less
                            spectacular ways. But bombers—I'm just hoping out of hope they'll draw
                            people in Saigon together. But bombers won't bring 'em to their
                            knees—unless we do something we wouldn't do. We'll be called
                            warmongers—elsewhere &amp; here in U.S. that'll be more
                            pronounced—peacemakers'll be after us.</p>
                        <p>Line-up forces: Who is with us? Lots of people against us. You can't then
                            wire [?].</p>
                        <p>This decision we made, I think, in December. Once we do it, let's tell
                            all the boys to take a P beforehand.</p>

                            that for a policy of continuing action the words “adequate and measured
                            and fitting” are better. “Fitting” is the word we used at the time of
                            Tonkin Gulf, and if we are going to continue actions in a situation in
                            which there is no spectacular outrage like Pleiku, I think “fitting” is
                            a better word than “prompt.” It may sound like mere semantics, but I
                            think it is quite near the center of the problem of stating your desires
                            precisely. Will you strike out whichever adjective you do not want?<note n="6" xml:id="d130fn6">The President struck out “prompt” and left in

                            naval action against North Viet-Nam whenever and wherever necessary. Our
                            thinking has been and continues to be that any such action shall be
                            limited and fitting and adequate as a response to the continuous
                            aggression in South Viet-Nam directed in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. Within 24 hours after the next military action we expect to make a
                            statement. Current plan is that this statement would come from the
                            Secretary of State, but decision is not final. This statement of policy
                            will reflect following elements of our thinking:</p>
                        <p>a. First and foremost, we shall intensify by all available means the
                            program of pacification within South Viet-Nam. Every<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">The President crossed out the following words
                                preceding “every” in the draft: “The President has directed
                                that.”</note> possible step will be taken to find and attack Viet
                            Cong concentrations and headquarters within South Viet-Nam by any and

                        <p>b. Execution of a joint program of measured and limited air action
                            against selected military targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Air strikes under this program will be jointly planned
                            and agreed. We presently plan to present this program to our National
                            Security Council tomorrow.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">See <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. We plan detailed presentation to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council of the case against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as the aggressor. We do not expect to touch upon
                            readiness for talks or negotiations at this time.</p>
                        <p>In execution of item c., above, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> will call for a meeting of the Security
                            Council immediately after next military action against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and will there present a fully
                            documented demonstration that the basic cause of the trouble in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is aggression from the North. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> will keep focus on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression.</p>
                        <p>3. Careful public statement of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            combined with fact of continuing air action, are expected to make it
                            clear that military action will continue <pb xml:id="pg_295" n="295" facs="0327"/>while aggression continues. But focus of public
                            attention will be kept as far as possible on aggression, not on military
                            operations. There will be no comment of any sort on future actions
                            except that all such actions will be adequate and measured and fitting
                            to aggression. Each new military action will be reported at once to the
                            Security Council, together with an account of continuing acts of
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>4. Concurrently with next military action, the US will inform major
                            friendly governments as well as the Soviet Government of our views as
                            outlined above.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this position you should emphasize to the Prime Minister
                            the very high degree of secrecy attaching to this plan of action until
                            final Presidential decision and orders have put it into operation.<note n="5" xml:id="d131fn5">In telegram 3961 from London, February 17,

                        <p>The key question remains whether to take a talking initiative in your
                            press conference statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">Stating that he

                                POL 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> I do not think
                            we can well omit it from the <pb xml:id="pg_296" n="296" facs="0328"/>press statement and then make it at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; this would seem a weakening of our position, coming so
                            close on the heels of the statement, whereas it can be put all in one
                            bite in the statement.</p>
                        <p>I would rack up the arguments as follows:</p>
                        <p>If we do not take a talking initiative:</p>
                        <p>1. There will be moderate, but bearable, public criticism at home. Even
                            without an initiative, we can go far enough to hold this within
                            bounds.</p>
                        <p>2. However, the real question is what others will then do.</p>
                        <p>a. <persName>Wilson</persName> is very restive and has specifically
                            flagged this very point in his talk with <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">See <ref target="#d131fn5">footnote 5, Document 131</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> already has the idea of
                            a group of major powers to work on a two-stage process.</p>
                        <p>c. The Indians have already proposed this on a “cessation of
                            provocations” formula, and the Canadians have expressed their sympathy.
                            Latest word last night is that the two governments are in close
                            touch.</p>
                        <p>d. The Soviets have already called for an immediate conference, although
                            Hanoi has not taken this up. (This points to Hanoi not showing up in New
                            York, and possibly not playing at all, which would get us off the hook
                            right then and there if we made an initiative.)</p>
                        <p>The sum total adds to a virtual certainty that either (a) some other
                            power will call for a preliminary meeting, or (b) there will be a move
                            in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> calling on North Viet-Nam to
                            cease its actions but calling, on an equal basis, for us to stop attacks
                            in the north and withdraw our forces over Geneva limits. In the former
                            case, we would look unwilling to talk even if we accepted, and we would
                            lose much control of the terms of reference of the talks. In the latter
                            case, we would be put on an equal footing with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and this would greatly stimulate “both
                            your houses” feeling all over.</p>
                        <p>3. The risks of military escalation will be very substantial.</p>
                        <p>If we take an initiative:</p>
                        <p>1. We will in any case run some risks of lowering morale in South
                            Viet-Nam and in Laos and Thailand. We must in any case clear exactly
                            what we are doing with them, and this we have not yet done.</p>
                        <p>2. We will have to fight off efforts in the Security Council itself to
                            frame the terms of the “cessation of provocations.” We should not seek
                            to litigate these in the Council, and should if necessary accede to
                            others adding our own actions, or a cease-fire in the south, to the
                            agenda, provided we get a formula that somehow puts the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> actions in the forefront. <pb xml:id="pg_297" n="297" facs="0329"/>(This is another element
                            arguing for an initiative by us, with maximum US control of
                            wording.)</p>
                        <p>3. We will have moved to “half a Geneva” before we have established any
                            real pattern of pressures on Hanoi, and would be in the somewhat novel
                            position of continuing our military actions while some form of talks was
                            going on. But this is what we always thought we would face in weeks or a
                            very few months in any case.</p>
                        <p>4. We cannot totally control the grouping that would emerge. The present
                            proposal calls for US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, and the two
                            Viet-Nams. But I hardly see how we can avoid Laos, unless we move
                            separately to convene a Laos Conference on the Article 19 point. A
                            two-ring circus is not without precedent—the 1954 Geneva Conference went
                            for some time with both Korea and Indochina on the agenda—but the merger
                            would tend to obscure the “preliminary” label we wish to retain for the
                            Viet-Nam part.</p>
                        <p>5. The risks of military escalation will be reduced, perhaps to a major
                            degree. If we feel impelled to increase the pace of our actions, we may
                            find ourselves under a shade more pressure not to. But equally the
                            Communist side might feel somewhat inhibited from drastic responses.</p>
                        <p>6. Developments within South Viet-Nam will be crucial to whether a decent
                            bargaining position emerges. If the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            continues to gain, we still face the grim choice of hitting the north
                            really hard (most unlikely to do the job at that point) or of waking up
                            one morning to find the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been at
                            the Liberation Front or Hanoi behind our backs. (This too would be in a
                            Geneva patten, for the real deal was made outside the conference, in
                            1954, between the French and the Viet Minh.) This would put us in a most
                            ungraceful position—but my own view is that the blow to our prestige
                            would be worse than if we had not negotiated and the same thing had
                            happened.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The meeting, held in the Cabinet Room, began at 1000 and ended at 1230.
                            The President welcomed General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, and said he was hopeful he could hear
                            General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s thinking
                            concerning the situation in South Viet-Nam. (During two or three minutes
                            prior to The President's entry into the Cabinet Room, General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had begun an exposition of
                            his views on the subject.) General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> began by stating that he viewed our purpose
                            as that of denying Southeast Asia to the Communists. This is a purpose
                            we share with other nations of the Western World, and they should be
                            brought to acknowledge and support this effort. His second point was
                            that the securing of the area could not be accomplished by a “Roman
                            wall,” composed of outside forces such as our own. It is necessary to
                            stop infiltration, and the Vietnamese themselves must be the basis for
                            that effort. We can, however, play a major part in destroying the will
                            of the enemy to continue the war.</p>
                        <p>The next major point was that morale is the key factor. He stressed that
                            he was referring to morale in its broadest sense. To emphasize its
                            importance, he quoted Napoleon as saying that “in war morale is to the
                            material element as three is to one”; his only disagreement is that he
                            would rate it as higher than three to one. The factor of morale applies
                            in several ways. First, our aim must be to destroy the enemy's morale;
                            i.e., to destroy his will to continue the war and attack the south.
                            Second, we must do everything possible to raise the morale of our own
                            side. In his judgment, air strikes against the north cannot deny the
                            ability of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to infiltrate. The
                            strike can, however, discourage the north, and can make them pay a cost
                            for continuing their aggression. He thought that morale is more
                            important in a guerilla war than in a conventional war. In the latter
                            case, the combat could be conducted with elite forces, but in the former
                            the participation, and hence the morale, of the entire population is
                            required.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_299" n="299" facs="0331"/>
                        <p>He regarded it as of fundamental importance that the population of South
                            Viet-Nam wants to be friendly to us. He recognized that there are limits
                            as to how far they can manifest such friendliness to us. If security is
                            lacking in the hamlets and in the countryside, the population will be
                            frightened and unable to cooperate. If they see that if they defend
                            themselves against the Communists their local leaders will be killed and
                            their village destroyed, they will do little. The question is how to
                            build morale. His first point is that success and victory, even if local
                            and limited, begin to build morale effectively. He noted that morale in
                            the south has risen because of the strikes by U.S. and <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> against the north. The strikes
                            following the Tonkin Gulf incident raised morale, which then suffered
                            when there was no followup. He also noted that the morale of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, despite the bitter fighting in which
                            they have been engaged, is high. We should ask ourselves what can be
                            done to get the nation to feel the same confidence in itself as the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units feel.</p>
                        <p>He made a strong plea for proper support for the [U.S.] Information
                            Service. He referred to the lack of Congressional support for this
                            activity in the past, and commented that he had once been told that the
                            Russians spend more on information activities in France alone than the
                            U.S. spends in the whole world. He related this need to the recent
                            attacks on our embassies. He thought too many of the people in the
                            countries involved do not know the probity of our aims. While the
                            participation of Communists in such attacks is to be expected, they
                            could not continue without some public participation, or public
                            tolerance. In stressing the need for better information and propaganda,
                            he said he thought the U.S. could take a half billion dollars out of
                            other governmental programs and put it into this with greater advantage.
                            There is too little understanding around the world of the record of the
                            U.S. through recent years, e.g., from 1920 onward. He thought the
                            information activity should fall into three categories. The first is
                            official; everything done in this way should stick strictly to the truth
                            and be entirely objective, disseminating pure information concerning the
                            activities of our country. The second is such activities as Radio Free
                            Europe, which furnish opinion; these should be supported, and should
                            have more latitude. The third should be clandestine; in this field we
                            should get other friends, governments and organizations to do the actual
                            job.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> than reverted
                            to the needs in South Viet-Nam. There is a need in his opinion for
                            information and inspiration. Also, it is necessary to give security to
                            the population, and to train the local forces in particular for this
                            purpose. He said he understood frequently villagers are threatened and
                            turn over their arms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            had told him that the Viet Cong obtain a large percentage of their arms
                            by capture from the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. He felt that
                            people must want to be saved; otherwise nothing can be done. He added
                            that he believes that the people of South Viet-Nam do <pb xml:id="pg_300" n="300" facs="0332"/>want to be saved, but they need
                            a feeling of protection for themselves and their families. They also
                            need a promise of independence and a better life. The French failed to
                            recognize the importance of the desire for independence. We should put
                            great stress on more rice for the people, medical assistance, and local
                            help of many kinds.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the question of the air strikes, he said that in his opinion
                            these retaliation actions have helped the situation a great deal.
                            However, he felt it is now important to shift to a campaign of pressure.
                            Targets should be struck north of the border which have an obvious
                            connection with infiltration. He thought such strikes could be well
                            justified before the world.</p>
                        <p>He commented that he was out of touch with the local political situation
                            there. The changes of government have been bewildering, and it is hard
                            to know whom to deal with. From his experience in the Orient, however,
                            he thought it was important to find someone who is promising and try to
                            bolster him. He commented that he had known <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> well. He recognized the difficulties attending
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, but recalled that, in
                            the case of France, before <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> came to power, he was anxious to see him gain
                            control. Even though he knew <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> would cause trouble in many areas, he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was the best hope
                            of saving the situation in France, which was rapidly going to pieces.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> also was a capable man.
                            Despite his nepotism, he would have been effective, and he felt that the
                            removal of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> resulted in a
                            great setback for our cause. He reiterated that we need someone to back.
                            He summarized the need for improving the morale of the government, of
                            the population, and of the armed services, particularly the local
                            forces. If morale is up, and with the resources we can make available,
                            there will be progress. We have the basis for this since we are
                            supporting Vietnamese freedom, unlike the French, who would not commit
                            themselves to the freedom of Viet-Nam. He stressed strongly that the
                            U.S. Government must tell our own people just what we are doing in the
                            area, i.e., what our policy is, and what course of action we are
                            following.</p>
                        <p>He next considered the question of Chinese Communist or Soviet
                            intervention. He said that if they threaten to intervene we should pass
                            the word back to them to take care lest dire results occur to them. He
                            commented on how the armistice was brought about in Korea. Following two
                            years or more of inconclusive effort, shortly after he came to office,
                            he had three messages passed to the Koreans and Chinese, one through
                                <persName corresp="#p_NEHRU1">Nehru</persName>, one through
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKSG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, and one
                            through officials at lower level who were participating in armistice
                            discussions. The gist of the messages was that if a satisfactory
                            armistice were not signed promptly, we would remove the limits we were
                            observing as to the area of combat and the weapons employed. He thought
                            we should let them know now what we are seeking to do in South Viet-Nam,
                            and that we would act <pb xml:id="pg_301" n="301" facs="0333"/>against
                            them if necessary. This should not be done publicly, but rather very
                            quietly. He recalled that at the time of the Suez incident, the Soviets
                            had threatened to use rockets against Britain and France. We had
                            immediately passed the word to the Soviets that, although we were in
                            disagreement with Britain and France, if any action were taken against
                            them by the Soviets, we would respond in their support with all means
                            required.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he had a
                            final point on tactics and the conduct of operations. He strongly
                            advised decentralization. The essential is to back a commander and trust
                            him. This requires that policies and missions be defined. The mission
                            can be very broadly stated. He recalled his own as a model—to enter the
                            continent of Europe and bring about the destruction of Germany's war
                            power. He quoted an old adage, “Centralization is the refuge of fear.”
                            Our representatives in the field are much more effective if we show that
                            we have confidence in them to do the job. As another tactical point, he
                            said he would not destroy the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s in
                            the Hanoi area right away. He would work hard on pacification in South
                            Viet-Nam, and start the attacks in the southern region of North
                            Viet-Nam, in order to begin to charge a price to them for their
                            continued aggression. He would let them and their Communist supporters
                            have no mistaken idea as to our purpose. He would make clear what we are
                            going to do in this regard.</p>
                        <p>At the President's request General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that the U.S. Government has already
                            started action with the objective of finding ways to strengthen the
                            security of the people of South Viet-Nam. In addition, on the military
                            aspects of General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s
                            comments, he stated that in a general way these suggestions have been
                            the approach the Administration has been taking.</p>
                        <p>The President, after thanking General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> for his comments, said he could best give the
                            thinking of the Administration by quoting from a message being sent to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> as a basis for
                            discussion with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> of the U.K. The text he read was as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of Document 131.]</p>
                        <p>The President made two comments. First, he was planning to meet with the
                            National Security Council later in the day, or the following day, and
                            expected to make his decision at that time.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">See <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> Second, he
                            commented that there had been a good deal of discussion regarding the
                            reference in paragraph 2. c. of the message to negotiations. Some of his
                            advisers were inclined to go further in the direction of indicating a
                            readiness or desire for an early conference. He invited General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s comment on <pb xml:id="pg_302" n="302" facs="0334"/>this point. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> cited President Lincoln's
                            handling of the Emancipation Proclamation. He had had it ready for
                            issuance long before it was promulgated, and in fact had wanted to put
                            it out. He felt, however, that he had to wait for a success, since
                            otherwise its issuance would be taken as an act of weakness if not
                            desperation. He therefore held it during the dreary months of military
                            reverses, but seized upon Lee's retreat from the Battle of Antietam (at
                            which Lee's army might well have been destroyed) as the occasion to
                            issue it. With regard to negotiations, General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> felt that negotiation from
                            weakness is likely to lead only into deceit and vulnerability, which
                            could be disastrous to us. On the other hand, if we can show a fine
                            record of successes, or real and dramatic accomplishment, we would be in
                            good position to negotiate. He advised not to negotiate from a position
                            of weakness. He commented that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> of the U.K. had not had experience with this kind
                            of problem. We, however, have learned that Munichs win nothing;
                            therefore, his answer to the British would be “Not now boys.”</p>
                        <p>The President read again the text of the messages<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">Presumably the February 7 letter printed in
                                Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 22,
                                1965, pp. 240–241.</note> concerning Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>'s presentation of the case in
                            the U.N.—it is to be cast in terms of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> aggression from the north. He read again that military
                            action would continue while the aggression continues. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> thought the message was a
                            good one. As to tactics, he would suggest that we should have the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> ready so that, if the Viet Cong
                            murder a governmental official, within as little as two hours they could
                            strike with six or eight planes against some targets in the north. This
                            should be done every time there is such an atrocity, and in this case
                            the action should be “blared out” publicly to create an immediate impact
                            and let the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> know they will not be
                            getting a free ride any longer.</p>
                        <p>The President then read from a message received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> in Bangkok reporting his meeting
                            with the Thai Foreign Minister. The text he read was as follows:</p>
                        <p>“This morning in my first meeting with Thanat after my return, I found
                            him in a rosy glow over vast improvement in morale throughout Southeast
                            Asia as a result of American and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            strikes at <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He was particularly
                            pleased at the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> participation. He
                            said he hoped that as result of release of details on extent of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration we would realize we had
                            perfectly justifiable rationale to continue such joint strikes at <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> targets connected with such
                            infiltration. Thanat said future strikes need not, therefore, be limited
                            to reprisals for attacks on American installations or personnel.</p>
                        <p>“He went on to observe that it was quite possible that we had now seen
                            the low point and future progress should be steadily upward. He <pb xml:id="pg_303" n="303" facs="0335"/>said the vastly increased
                            hopefulness would quite likely serve as a cement of sorts among <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> factions and said <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> seemed to have best chance since
                            1954 to create more broadly based regime. He agreed with my observation
                            it quite likely Viet Cong would try more spectacular strikes but thought
                            prompt retaliatory action would soon prove this unprofitable tactic. He
                            made it clear, in response to my request for elaboration his thought
                            'low point' had been reached, that he well aware struggle would take
                            long time with sharp reverses from time to time but again expressed
                            conviction that psychological turn-around reached if we remained firm.
                            Thanat said he had only one worry. Referring to 15 Feb issue of Paris
                            edition of NY Herald Tribune and NY Times, carrying spate of stories on
                            'negotiations', he said he was certain Secretary understood now was not
                            the proper moment to indicate any desire to return to conference table.
                            When I pressed him on Thai reaction he said, after considerable pause
                            for reflection, he thought he could bring Thai government to new
                            conference, but only when we had continued pressure on north for
                            sufficient period to make negotiations worthwhile to north to obtain
                            relief from such pressures. This, he said, obviously was quite a bit in
                            the future since Hanoi would undoubtedly need quite a bit of convincing.
                            I said I thought the Secretary had made this position very clear in his
                            reiteration of the necessity for Hanoi to begin observance of the
                            commitments undertaken in 1954 before considering new negotiations.
                            Thanat agreed.</p>
                        <p>“In response to my question Thanat said he gathered from comments from
                            officials Soviet Embassy here that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> taken completely by surprise at Pleiku attacks.
                            He thought Sovs would confine their reactions to 'noise' and a bit more
                            ink on American Embassy walls throughout the world. He thought Soviet
                            hard-headed appraisal their self-interest almost guaranteed no greater
                            reaction. Similarly, he thought in absence direct threat to ChiCom
                            borders, there would be no Chinese reaction. He did think, however, that
                            Thailand would be subjected to increasing subversive pressures and hoped
                            we could be helpful. I said my consultations in Washington convinced me
                            that specific Thai plans in this regard would find helpful and
                            forthcoming response from U.S. side.”</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said this was a
                            fine message, and expressed congratulations to the Ambassador for asking
                            the right questions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> picked up the
                            point of not trying to destroy the capability of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support the insurgency in the south.
                            He thought such an attempt would not succeed. Instead we should try to
                            destroy the will of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to continue
                            their political interference and their guerilla activity. We should try
                            to induce them to get out of the war without having their country
                            destroyed and to realize that if they do not get out, their country will
                            be destroyed. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            added that an objective <pb xml:id="pg_304" n="304" facs="0336"/>of the
                            strikes is to improve the morale of the people in the south. He cited
                            the example of Mosby's operations in northern Virginia during the Civil
                            War. Mosby could succeed only as long as he had the support of the
                            population. The importance of such support also was shown in Lee's
                            failures; both times he attempted to invade the north and found himself
                            without intelligence because he was surrounded by a hostile population.
                            The morale of South Viet-Nam will rise when the people see the strikes
                            in the north, and when they are given some security in the south. More
                            than this is needed however. There should be inspiration and some
                            positive contribution. In the Orient the radio is an outstanding way to
                            motivate. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            referred to his observations in an Indian village where all the people
                            of the village would gather around a single radio in very bad repair to
                            gain contact with the outer world. Help should also be given to the
                            population of the countryside and the hamlets, to let them know that
                            America is with them. In addition, rice, medical attention and many
                            other practical forms of help to the people should be utilized.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was much interested in General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s recommendations concerning
                            the strengthening of the information services and activities. He stated
                            that he had in mind to send <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Frank
                                Stanton</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Carl
                                Rowan</persName> out to Viet-Nam in the near future to see what
                            could be done to strengthen these activities. He observed that the air
                            strikes against the north might well have an additional effect, beyond
                            those mentioned, of helping to stabilize the government in the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> joined the
                            meeting at this point.)</p>
                        <p>The President next said that he wished to make a close analysis of these
                            strikes, to consider how much provocation they would give, and what the
                            effects of various types of strikes might be. He mentioned specifically
                            the “prestige” bridge target. At his request, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> explained the targeting that
                            has been accomplished, drawing upon the 94 target list,<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d331fn7">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. I,
                                    Document 331, footnote 7</ref>.</note> and indicating the
                            general complex of targets in the south which have been hit and are
                            under consideration for the next strikes. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> thought it would be good to
                            confine strike activities to the southern end of North Viet-Nam
                            initially. If the Viet Cong do something big in the way of attacking in
                            South Viet-Nam, then we should “hit them big” in the north. He thought
                            we should do as much as possible with the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>. Their airmen are bound to brag about what they have
                            done, and this will give a psychology of accomplishment to the South
                            Vietnamese, with benefit to their morale. He thought the program should
                            be one in which we put the pressure on and keep it on. He would
                            obliterate the facilities the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> have
                            constructed in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_305" n="305" facs="0337"/>
                        <p>The President asked for a judgment as to the likelihood of the Chinese
                            and the Russians coming into the war. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> thought the Chinese would
                            react in a much harder way than the Russians. To a question by The
                            President as to whether the Russians might put pressure on Berlin,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> felt that, in
                            a matter so serious, they would choose their own course rather than be
                            influenced by what we do. He said he would not fear such a reaction. The
                            President then asked what we might do if Chinese forces were to come
                            south, posing a requirement for eight to ten U.S. divisions in Southeast
                            Asia. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he
                            would hit them at once with air, picking out the key points along their
                            support routes. He said he would use any weapons required, adding that
                            if we were to use tactical nuclear weapons, such use would not in itself
                            add to the chance of escalation. With regard to starting a bigger war,
                            he felt that the Chinese would not do this unless they had made the
                            decision on their own. He further stated that he believed they would not
                            come in to the war, but that, if they should, he would use some
                            additional ground units against them, but would essentially shift to use
                            of different weapons. He commented that the U.S. must take extreme care
                            never to allow itself to get over-deployed. Our rule must always be to
                            “hit the head of the snake.” (As an aside, he commented that in his
                            opinion the U.S. is over-deployed in Europe. The need of the Europeans
                            for U.S. forces there has long since diminished. He acknowledged that
                            many people do not agree with him in this view.) He stated that if our
                            intelligence saw fifteen to twenty Chinese divisions coming into the
                            war, we should hit their LOC with the strongest possible attacks.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that
                            we have given thought to the possibility of putting one U.S. division
                            south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, both to protect and to
                            deter while the strikes against the north go on. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he would see merit in
                            action of this kind, but would not send in anything like a dozen U.S.
                            divisions, and start a big war of that kind. He would use whatever was
                            needed to immobilize the attacking forces and would secure the key areas
                            in South Viet-Nam, for example, the three major airfield areas which
                            were outlined to him.</p>
                        <p>At this point members of The President's staff came into the Cabinet Room
                            to ask what might be said to the press, and whether pictures might be
                            taken. The President thought it might simply be pointed out that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was in the city
                            having a monthly physical checkup at Walter Reed, and that he had taken
                            advantage of his presence to meet with him to talk about Europe,
                            Southeast Asia, and other world problems. He asked whether General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would care to meet
                            the press, and General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            said he felt that any statements made concerning meetings in the White
                            House should be made by The President or on his behalf, and that he
                            would simply go out as he had come in, through the south grounds.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_306" n="306" facs="0338"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> suggested that
                            every one of our ambassadors should be given the substance of the
                            message sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, and they should be advised to say to the government
                            to which they are accredited that these governments also should take
                            some responsibility for what is being done in Southeast Asia in behalf
                            of the freedom of South Viet-Nam. To illustrate his point, he described
                            how France and Britain had failed to tell their people what stand our
                            government was taking on the Suez matter prior to the invasion. As a
                            result, there was bitter feeling in those countries on the unjustified
                            grounds that we had not given notice we would oppose them.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to revert to the subject of
                            negotiations. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            said there are two requirements in his view. First, the enemy must want
                            to come to us, which means that we must be in the position of strength.
                            The second is that any agreement reached must be self-enforcing, or we
                            must be able to put our own people into the area in order to verify
                            performance. He asked in this regard what the Russians are doing about
                            their recent nuclear tests, which “vented” in violation of the treaty.
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> reviewed the exchange of notes with the
                            Russians, and indicated that the dialogue is still going on. He also
                            indicated that the treaty is not precise on this score, and that if the
                            Russians take the view that very small amounts of debris should be
                            disregarded, we may be able to use such latitude ourselves in the
                            future. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> saw
                            merit in such a position.</p>
                        <p>The President next referred to the Resolution<note n="5" xml:id="d133fn5">See ibid., p. 664.</note> the Congress had passed following the
                            Tonkin Gulf incident, giving him authority to act. He asked General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> whether he thought
                            that Resolution was strong enough, and ample to fill the need. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that it had
                            sounded to him very much like the Formosa Resolution which had left a
                            large area of discretion and flexibility to The President, and that he
                            thought that this is the way it should be. The President commented that
                            the Formosa Resolution had been the model for this one.</p>
                        <p>At The President's request Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> reviewed very
                            briefly the observations he had made on his recent trip to South
                            Viet-Nam. Two out-standing points were the lack of security for the
                            population in the countryside, and the little experience of government
                            which South Viet-Nam has had. The President commented that steps are
                            being taken to try to strengthen the government and to seek some
                            rapprochement with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. He
                            said he is considering the possibility of trying to get some good U.S.
                            reporters and TV people to go out to the area for a period of thirty to
                            ninety days, in order to introduce greater responsibility in the
                            handling of the political reporting. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> made
                            the point that the <pb xml:id="pg_307" n="307" facs="0339"/>Buddhists
                            have had no experience in taking responsibility. Theirs has been an
                            opposition role. Also he stated that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is very Asian and devious politically. He added
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> had
                            said that, in the military matters on which he deals with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, the latter had never deceived
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The President said he saw great importance in developing a sense of
                            participation on the part of the South Vietnamese. We should find
                            targets they can really hit, and should work the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> hard. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> reviewed the “<gloss target="#t_MAROPS1">MAROPS</gloss>” program of unacknowledged
                            attacks from the sea conducted by the South Vietnamese. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he thought
                            these operations were valuable. The President reiterated that we should
                            get as many South Vietnamese as possible in sea and patrol
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>(At this point The President and General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> went into The President's office to have
                            pictures taken, and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> left the
                            meeting.)</p>
                        <p>When the President and General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> returned, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked for further comment on how General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would advise
                            responding to escalation, and what he had in mind regarding tactical
                            nuclear weapons. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he would make use of our carrier
                            strength in the area for instant retaliation. For this purpose it should
                            be kept in constant readiness. He would pass warnings to the Chinese
                            Communists. Pick out the two or three key points in South Viet-Nam, such
                            as Saigon and the air bases, and guard these strongly. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> identified these as Da Nang,
                            Tan Son Nhut and Bien Hoa. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said tactical nuclear weapons should be used
                            when the enemy comes in large strength as organized formations. lf they
                            have strong forces these will have depots which can be struck. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> commented that there
                            are bridges very important to such a campaign over the Red River north
                            of Hanoi. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            commented that this would be in effect a new war. We should be sure that
                            the enemy does not lack an appreciation of our stamina and determination
                            to keep nations free by whatever means required. He thought that if they
                            find we are ready, they will not come in in great strength. He referred
                            to the Chinese in Korea. There was a gentlemen's agreement between us
                            and our allies after the very early days of the war—well known to the
                            Chinese—that we would not cross the Yalu or even strike the bridges on
                            the Yalu, nor would we use nuclear weapons. With regard to South
                            Viet-Nam, we should let it be known that we are not bound by such
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> what he could tell him about the course of
                            events in Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that in 1949 severe cuts were made in
                            the U.S. military budget. The Joint Chiefs of Staff at that time (with
                            himself presiding as chairman at The President's <pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0340"/>request) reached the view that in a global war
                            Korea would not be important, although it was important in a cold war
                            situation. As a result of the cutback of the budget and of the armed
                            forces, it was necessary to withdraw our units from Korea. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> made a public
                            statement at that time that Korea lay outside our security perimeter.
                            Soon thereafter the Communists invaded the country. Mr. Truman initially
                            attempted to meet the attack, using only naval and air forces. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said once we had
                            committed ourselves to the war, he had advised Mr. Truman that we must
                            use whatever force was needed. He had told him that we must succeed, and
                            that if ground forces were required they should be put in. The President
                            said he is concerned regarding the North Vietnamese, and the possibility
                            that war in Viet-Nam might follow the same course as the war in Korea.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said the U.S.
                            has put its prestige onto the proposition of keeping Southeast Asia
                            free. Indonesia is now failing. We cannot let the Indo-Chinese peninsula
                            go. He hoped it would not be necessary to use the six to eight divisions
                            mentioned, but if it should be necessary, so be it. He would warn the
                            Chinese in advance through many channels.</p>
                        <p>The President asked just what General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had done in 1953 to bring the war in Korea to
                            a close. He said he had had the word passed through the three channels
                            he had previously mentioned, telling the Chinese that they must agree to
                            an armistice quickly, since he had decided to remove the restrictions of
                            area and weapons if the war had to be continued. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that the greatest
                            danger in his judgment in the present situation is that the Chinese get
                            the idea that we will go just so far and no further in terms of the
                            level of war we would conduct. That would be the beginning of the end,
                            since they would know all they had to do was go further than we do. The
                            President asked how such information might be gotten out, i. e., that we
                            think the situation would be most dangerous unless the Chinese
                            understood that we will do whatever is required. He and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> discussed the
                            possibility of approaching Ayub on this matter. They agreed he is a very
                            fine man with whom we are having some difficulties at the present time.
                            The President is considering what can be done to improve our ties with
                            him. General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> described
                            this problem as one boil in the whole world system. We must look at the
                            effect of our actions on the whole world. When we say we will help other
                            countries we must then be staunch. It is, of course, necessary to work
                            out our tactics, and we should not be unnecessarily provocative.</p>

                        <p>I would like to share with you my views on the political consequences of
                            certain courses of action that have been proposed in regard to U.S.
                            policy in Southeast Asia. I refer both to the domestic political
                            consequences here in the United States and to the international
                            political consequences.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Domestic Political Consequences.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. 1964 Campaign.</p>
                        <p>Although the question of U.S. involvement in Vietnam is and should be a
                            non-partisan question, there have always been significant differences in
                            approach to the Asian question between the Republican Party and the
                            Democratic Party. These came out in the 1964 campaign. The Republicans
                            represented both by Goldwater, and the top Republican leaders in
                            Congress, favored a quick, total military solution in Vietnam, to be
                            achieved through military escalation of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Democratic position emphasized the complexity of a Vietnam situation
                            involving both political, social and military factors; the necessity of
                            staying in Vietnam as long as necessary; recognition that the war will
                            be won or lost chiefly in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In Vietnam, as in Korea, the Republicans have attacked the Democrats
                            either for failure to use our military power to “win” a total victory,
                            or alternatively for losing the country to the Communists. The
                            Democratic position has always been one of firmness in the face of
                            Communist pressure but restraint in the use of military force; it has
                            sought to obtain the best possible settlement without provoking a
                            nuclear World War III; <pb xml:id="pg_310" n="310" facs="0342"/>it has
                            sought to leave open face-saving options to an opponent when necessary
                            to avoid a nuclear show-down. When grave risks have been necessary, as
                            in the case of Cuba, they have been taken. But here again a face-saving
                            option was permitted the opponent. In all instances the Democratic
                            position has included a balancing of both political and military
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>Today the Administration is being charged by some of its critics with
                            adopting the Goldwater position on Vietnam. While this is not true of
                            the Administration's position as defined by the President, it is true
                            that many key advisors in the Government are advocating a policy
                            markedly similar to the Republican policy as defined by Goldwater.</p>
                        <p>2. Consequences for other policies advocated by a Democratic
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>The <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration is associated both at
                            home and abroad with a policy of progress toward detente with the Soviet
                            bloc, a policy of limited arms control, and a policy of new initiatives
                            for peace. A full-scale military attack on North Vietnam—with the
                            attendant risk of an open military clash with Communist China—would risk
                            gravely undermining other U.S. policies. It would eliminate for the time
                            being any possible exchange between the President and Soviet leaders; it
                            would postpone any progress on arms control; it would encourage the
                            Soviet Union and China to end their rift; it would seriously hamper our
                            efforts to strengthen relations with our European allies; it would
                            weaken our position in the United Nations; it might require a call-up of
                            reservists if we were to get involved in a large-scale land war—and a
                            consequent increase in defense expenditures; it would tend to shift the
                            Administration's emphasis from its Great Society oriented programs to
                            further military outlays; finally and most important it would damage the
                            image of the President of the United States—and that of the United
                            States itself.</p>
                        <p>3. Involvement in a full scale war with North Vietnam would not make
                            sense to the majority of the American people.</p>
                        <p>American wars have to be politically understandable by the American
                            public. There has to be a cogent, convincing case if we are to have
                            sustained public support. In World Wars I and II we had this. In Korea
                            we were moving under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices to
                            defend South Korea against dramatic, across-the-border conventional
                            aggression. Yet even with those advantages, we could not sustain
                            American political support for fighting the Chinese in Korea in
                            1952.</p>
                        <p>Today in Vietnam we lack the very advantages we had in Korea. The public
                            is worried and confused. Our rationale for action has shifted away now
                            even from the notion that we are there as advisors on request of a free
                            government—to the simple argument of our “national interest.” We have
                            not succeeded in making this “national interest” interesting enough at
                            home or abroad to generate support.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_311" n="311" facs="0343"/>
                        <p>4. From a political viewpoint, the American people find it hard to
                            understand why we risk World War III by enlarging a war under terms we
                            found unacceptable 12 years ago in Korea, particularly since the chances
                            of success are slimmer.</p>
                        <p>Politically, people think of North Vietnam and North Korea. They recall
                            all the “lessons” of 1950–53:</p>
                        <p>a. The limitations of air power.</p>
                        <p>b. The Chinese intervention.</p>
                        <p>c. The “never again club”—never again GI's fighting a land war against
                            Asians in Asia.</p>
                        <p>d. The <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration's
                            compromise which represented a frank recognition of all these
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>If a war with China was ruled out by the Truman and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administrations alike in
                            1952–3, at a time when we alone had nuclear weapons, people find it hard
                            to contemplate such a war with China now. No one really believes the
                            Soviet Union would allow us to destroy Communist China with nuclear
                            weapons, as Russia's status as a world power would be undermined if she
                            did.</p>
                        <p>5. Absence of confidence in the Government of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Politically, people can't understand why we would run grave risks to
                            support a country which is totally unable to put its own house in order.
                            The chronic instability in Saigon directly undermines American political
                            support for our policy.</p>
                        <p>6. Politically, it is hard to justify over a long period of time
                            sustained, large-scale U.S. air bombardments across a border as a
                            response to camouflaged, often non-sensational, elusive, small-scale
                            terror which has been going on for 10 years in what looks like a civil
                            war in the South.</p>
                        <p>7. Politically, in Washington and across the country, the opposition is
                            more Democratic than Republican.</p>
                        <p>8. Politically, it is always hard to cut losses. But the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> Administration is in a stronger
                            position to do so than any Administration in this century. 1965 is the
                            year of minimum political risk for the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            Administration. Indeed it is the first year when we can face the Vietnam
                            problem without being preoccupied with the political repercussions from
                            the Republican right. As indicated earlier, the political problems are
                            likely to come from new and different sources if we pursue an enlarged
                            military policy very long (Democratic liberals, Independents, Labor,
                            Church groups).</p>
                        <p>9. Politically, we now risk creating the impression that we are the
                            prisoner of events in Vietnam. This blurs the Administration's
                            leadership role and has spill-over effects across the board. It also
                            helps erode confidence and credibility in our policies.</p>
                        <p>10. The President is personally identified with, and admired for,
                            political ingenuity. He will be expected to put all his great political
                            sense <pb xml:id="pg_312" n="312" facs="0344"/>to work now for
                            international political solutions. People will be counting upon him to
                            use on the world scene his unrivalled talents as a political leader.</p>
                        <p>They will be watching to see how he makes this transition. The best
                            possible outcome a year from now would be a Vietnam settlement which
                            turns out to be better than was in the cards because the President's
                            political talents for the first time came to grips with a fateful world
                            crisis and so successfully. It goes without saying that the subsequent
                            domestic political benefits of such an outcome, and such a new dimension
                            for the President, would be enormous.</p>
                        <p>11. If on the other hand, we find ourselves leading from frustration to
                            escalation, and end up short of a war with China but embroiled deeper in
                            fighting with Vietnam over the next few months, political opposition
                            will steadily mount. It will underwrite all the negativism and
                            disillusionment which we already have about foreign involvement
                            generally—with direct spill-over effects politically for all the
                            Democratic internationalist programs to which we are committed—<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            disarmament, and activist world policies generally.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. International Political Implications of
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. What is our goal, our ultimate objective in Vietnam? Is our goal to
                            restore a military balance between North and South Vietnam so as to go
                            to the conference table later to negotiate a settlement? I believe it is
                            the latter. If so, what is the optimum time for achieving the most
                            favorable combination of factors to achieve this goal?</p>
                        <p>If ultimately a negotiated settlement is our aim, when do we start
                            developing a political track, in addition to the military one, that
                            might lead us to the conference table? I believe we should develop the
                            political track earlier rather than later. We should take the initiative
                            on the political side and not end up being dragged to a conference as an
                            unwilling participant. This does not mean we should cease all programs
                            of military pressure. But we should distinguish carefully between those
                            military actions necessary to reach our political goal of a negotiated
                            settlement, and those likely to provoke open Chinese military
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>We should not underestimate the likelihood of Chinese intervention and
                            repeat the mistake of the Korean War. If we begin to bomb further north
                            in Vietnam, the likelihood is great of an encounter with the Chinese Air
                            Force operating from sanctuary bases across the border. Once the Chinese
                            Air Force is involved, Peking's full prestige will be involved as she
                            cannot afford to permit her Air Force to be destroyed. To do so would
                            undermine, if not end, her role as a great power in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Confrontation with the Chinese Air Force can easily lead to massive
                            retaliation by the Chinese in South Vietnam. What is our response to
                            this? Do we bomb Chinese air bases and nuclear installations 0342? If
                            so, will not <pb xml:id="pg_313" n="313" facs="0345"/>the Soviet Union
                            honor its treaty of friendship and come to China's assistance? I believe
                            there is a good chance that it would—thereby involving us in a war with
                            both China and the Soviet Union. Here again, we must remember the
                            consequences for the Soviet Union of not intervening if China's military
                            power is destroyed by the U.S.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador said that he wished, on instructions from his
                            Foreign Secretary, to discuss Vietnam. The Foreign Secretary's
                            instruction stemmed from a conversation the British Ambassador in Moscow
                            had with <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName> on February 16. In
                            response to <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName>'s reference to
                            North Vietnam's message to the co-chairman for Vietnam,<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:
                                    Current Documents, 1965</hi>, p. 833.</note> the British
                            Ambassador had reviewed what he understood was the Soviet position, to
                            wit that the Soviets had no desire to reactivate their role as
                            co-chairman and that they had no authority to do so under the 1954
                            agreement. <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName> said that he
                            agreed that the 1954 agreement did not give specific authority for the
                            co-chairmanship role but said that when there is a fire the firemen
                            should not argue about their authority to act. It was important to use
                            all means to help the victims of U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The British
                            Ambassador in Moscow surmised that the changed Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_314" n="314" facs="0346"/>attitude resulted from North
                            Vietnam's pressure on <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.
                            The Ambassador requested instructions from the Foreign Office on 1)
                            reviving the co-chairmanship role in Vietnam, 2) rebutting Soviet
                            arguments about the North Vietnamese as victims of aggression, and 3)
                            positive action that the co-chairman might take to accomplish a peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> said that the
                            Foreign Secretary believed that we should try to provide ammunition to
                            the Ambassador in Moscow, and had asked him to consult with the U.S. on
                            what answer should be provided. <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord
                                Harlech</persName> then read from the Foreign Secretary's suggestion
                            as to how to reply to point one, stating in essence that the British
                            thought it would be desirable to revive the tradition of informal
                            voluntary Anglo-Soviet cooperation on Vietnam's problems. <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> handed Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a copy of the Foreign

                                explained the British position. A copy is in Department of State,

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that it was important to consider how we should
                            respond to the Soviet initiative. On a tentative basis, he and Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> concurred that it would be useful for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to continue its co-chairman role
                            with the Soviets in Vietnam. The Secretary said that they would review
                            this proposal in detail and inform <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord
                                Harlech</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> then said that the
                            Foreign Secretary felt it was difficult to make any response to the
                            Soviets without more evidence of U.S. intent. He thought it would be
                            advantageous if the U.S. would define publicly its objectives and the
                            conditions which would enable it to negotiate the Vietnam problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> said he
                            personally thought it would also be useful to make clear in any
                            statement that the U.S. had no designs on North Vietnam. Without a clear
                            public statement of U.S. intent, it would become even more difficult for
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to continue in Parliament to
                            support the U.S. or even to justify continuing the co-chairmanship role.
                            The Foreign Secretary felt that the need for a clarification of U.S.
                            policy existed prior to <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName>'s
                            remark. <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName>'s remarks added
                            urgency to this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> did
                            not think it desirable to tie down the details of the Hanoi attack.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> said <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> agreed there was a need for such an
                            explanation but that it should be supplemented by an outline of U.S.
                            policy. The Secretary then said that apart from the necessity of gaining
                            a common acceptance of the elementary facts of the situation, we should
                            be certain the Soviets are under no misunderstanding of the facts as we
                            see them. They need not, of course, be required to agree with our
                            interpretation. In addition, it would be useful to determine whether the
                            Soviets were ascribing difficulties purely to <pb xml:id="pg_315" n="315" facs="0347"/>South Vietnam or whether they agreed that it
                            was a problem of the North Vietnamese as well.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then explained the difficulties of making a public
                            statement on our policy towards Vietnam. If we were too precise about
                            the problem, we could reduce our maneuverability. For the Ambassador's
                            private information, however, the Secretary stated he was thinking of
                            making a press statement this week.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> stressed the
                            Foreign Secretary's feeling that we had moved into a new phase on the
                            Vietnam problem and that it was consequently essential to have a new
                            statement of U.S. policy. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would
                            have an increasingly difficult time holding the line unless it could
                            point to a U.S. position which the British could support. Without such a
                            guide, more and more suggestions would be made as to how other people or
                            organizations could solve the problem. The problem would become
                            particularly difficult for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if it
                            continues in its co-chairman role.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that we would not consider negotiations unless we
                            felt there was some possibility of a meaningful conclusion to them. It
                            was conceivable that if we made a formal proposal to negotiate on such
                            and such conditions that it would be rejected at the outset by the other
                            side. On the other hand, if we met without any reasonable prospects of
                            success and failed, where could we go from there? The Secretary said he
                            would inform <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName>
                            shortly of our reactions to the British Foreign Secretary's
                                proposals.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">In telegram 1744 to Saigon,

                            we have given thought to the British request that we indicate what we
                            thought they might say to the Soviets as to action by the <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairmen, and that we had further

                            suggestion would be that the British approach the Soviets to say that
                            the most useful thing the <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairmen could now do would be to call on other

                            action to deal with the essentials of the situation as set forth in our

                        <p>2. We would expect the British to respond favorably to this suggestion,
                            and to take it up at once with the Soviets—as their initiative. If the
                            British then reported that the Soviets agreed, they would combine this
                            with a request for our views, and we would immediately send them the
                            revised note.</p>
                        <p>3. Any press conference would be timed in relation to the completion of
                            this sequence, since the press conference would not be useful unless it
                            could be the occasion for revealing our note.</p>
                        <p>4. At whatever time we approach <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord
                                Harlech</persName> with this suggestion, we would inform our
                            Embassies in Saigon, Bangkok, and Vientiane of what we were proposing to
                            do, arming them with the necessary arguments <pb xml:id="pg_317" n="317" facs="0349"/>to explain it to their governments. Query whether we
                            should immediately have Saigon go to work with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> framing a similar <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> response to go alongside our own. Query
                            also whether the approaches to these three governments could take place
                            even before the British had hit the Soviets; I would think there would
                            be much merit to doing so at once, particularly as we might wish to
                            explain to Saigon why we would not wish to have another joint strike
                            until the sequence had been completed. In this respect, the firm tone of
                            the President's statement of yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">At

                            serve, as read in Saigon, to leave no doubt that we are going on with
                            strikes, and this is the essential point.</p>
                        <p>5. Australia and New Zealand could be fully informed of our proposed
                            sequence immediately after we have told the British. They should also be
                            told that we are going ahead with joint strikes and approximately the
                            desired pace and degree of severity.</p>
                        <p>6. Canada, India, and <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> are
                            special problems. Canada could be told exactly what we are doing, but
                            both India and, more severely, <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U
                                Thant</persName> raise security problems in that they might surface
                            the sequence as a US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> collusion, which
                            we are anxious to avoid to the degree possible,</p>
                        <p>7. We should hold off on the next strike until the British have gone to
                            the Soviets and have a response. If the Soviets should ask time to think
                            it over, this might, however, cause undue delay. Accordingly, we should
                            consider whether we would then ask the British to seek our views, and go
                            ahead on the basis of this request only without waiting for the Soviets
                            to join in. However, this would somewhat weaken the key element in the
                            sequence, which is to bring the Soviets at least half way aboard in the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairman role right at the

                            Council, we would still plan to circulate the full printed document of
                            our case, after we had completed the sequence. We would also have the
                            possibility of an additional oral presentation either concurrently, or
                            within a day or two after the written version was sent to the President

                            received a fellow from the Soviet Union about reinvigorating the

                            they might do some exploring with various parties. It would avoid going
                            into the Security Council where the Soviet Union would be pushed into
                            the position of being the advocate for the Communist side. If the
                            Soviets are accepted this will give them a chance to avoid getting mixed
                            in deeper because they could say that they are acting as the impartial
                            party.</p>

                            philosophy. The paper took a strong position of any initiative on our
                            side which would involve our making a public approach initiating
                            machinery for settlement. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            asked McN to think about the possibility of stirring the British up so
                            they could talk to their Soviet colleagues about coming back to both the
                            US and Hanoi with a request for a statement of our positions. On this
                            basis if they chose to do so they could see what they wanted to do but
                            without in any way looking like our initiative. McN asked what the
                            President's reaction had been to this. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he was interested but wanted to think about
                            it. McN thought it important not to be hooked to it because of his
                            strong feeling about initiatives on our part. McN asked what our answer
                            to the press would be if they asked our reaction to the British bringing
                            the parties together. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said,
                            if asked we would be glad to make a statement.</p>
                        <p>McN thought there would be some merit in this and he thought we had to
                            move toward negotiation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the advantage of this
                            is that it would not get us into a conference and tie our hands.</p>

                            probably get us into a seven power conference or into a position where

                            a conference where we would look bad if we did not agree to do so.</p>
                        <p>McN thought it better if we went into the Security Council because we
                            know that China and Hanoi are not going to come before the Security
                            Council.</p>

                            out. This was on the assumption that we would make an approach ourselves
                            to the co-chairmen. The central part is a statement of our position. It

                            views might be made soon enough for the draft reply note to be used

                        <p rend="center">The Estimate </p>
                        <p>1. The US air attacks on North Vietnam have added another ingredient to
                            an already intricate and complex situation. Hence Communist reactions to
                            these attacks will not be the product of the attacks alone, but will be
                            governed by numerous factors: the state of relations among the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; the attitudes and conduct of various
                            free world powers—especially France; developments in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; the <pb xml:id="pg_321" n="321" facs="0353"/>course of events in South Vietnam; the manner and pace
                            with which the US air attacks develop and the policy of the US itself,
                            not only as this policy may be enunciated by the administration, but
                            also as the Communists may read the influence upon it of newspaper and
                            Congressional declarations and other expressions of diverse views. We
                            cannot estimate with confidence or precision how these factors will
                            interact in weeks to come.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Reactions to the Bombings of Early February or to a
                                Few More of the Same Type, South of the 19th Parallel</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. To establish Communist power in South Vietnam and to unify the country
                            under the Hanoi regime is the primary national objective of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders. From the beginning of the
                            insurrection in the South, however, they have consistently admonished
                            their followers to be prepared for a long struggle. Only in the past few
                            months have they occasionally talked in terms of victory being near.
                            This feeling may have been dampened somewhat by the past week's tougher
                            US action.</p>
                        <p>3. There are probably some among the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            leadership who would prefer a cautious course. They would urge that
                            collapse of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> resistance is inevitable
                            in time despite any amount of foreign support, and that it would be
                            foolish to risk destruction of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            laboriously acquired modern economic sector merely to accelerate the
                            pace of victory. However, in the present moment of high emotion in Hanoi
                            they probably hesitate to voice such thoughts.</p>
                        <p>4. To the militant majority, the recent US air attacks probably appear to
                            be the actions of a foe endeavoring to ward off defeat. These leaders
                            probably reason that if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> stand firm or even increase their
                            pressures in the South, they will have to ride out a few more such US
                            attacks, but that the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> disposition
                            to continue the struggle will decline. To these leaders, any display of
                            apparent weakness in the face of the bombing would signal to the US that
                            it had hit upon the way to get what it wants in the area.</p>
                        <p>5. We accordingly believe that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> reaction to a few
                            more air attacks like those of early February would probably be to
                            continue their pressures in the South more or less on the scale of
                            recent weeks—always with an eye upon factors like those mentioned in
                            paragraph 1. At the moment, the Communists cannot be sure whether US
                            actions presage a sustained course of air attack or a “tit-for-tat”
                            program of limited reprisals to specific provocations. It is possible
                            that they would, for a week or two, refrain from direct attacks on US
                            installations, but we cannot estimate that such restraint is
                            probable.</p>
                        <p>6. The Chinese Communists will almost certainly encourage the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in the more militant course. We do not
                            believe that they will intervene in Vietnam with substantial military
                            force during this stage. We see <pb xml:id="pg_322" n="322" facs="0354"/>no evidence at present of preparations to do so, although we cannot
                            have full confidence in our ability to detect such preparations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Reactions to a Declared and Sustained US Program of
                                Bombing in the North</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Over the past decade the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has
                            invested much time, effort, and capital in the development of industry,
                            transportation, and relatively modern military facilities. They will not
                            lightly sacrifice these hard-won gains. Yet a threat by the US to mount
                            sustained attacks on these assets would probably be greeted in Hanoi
                            with mixed feelings of trepidation and skepticism. At the start, the
                            Communists would not be convinced that the US intended really to follow
                            through with this program. They would almost certainly apply a range of
                            pressures in an endeavor to make the US desist. They would maintain
                            strenuous diplomatic and propaganda efforts to organize international
                            influence against the US policy. They would probably threaten dire
                            consequences to US interests in the area. Chinese Communist threats
                            would be more insistent, and Chinese Communist forces would probably be
                            deployed in more threatening postures. Viet Cong attacks would probably
                            continue, though not necessarily at a steady pace.</p>
                        <p>8. If despite these pressures, the US vigorously continued in its attacks
                            and damaged some important economic or military assets, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders would have to reach a decision.
                            They almost certainly believe that, while the US could destroy much in
                            their country by air attacks, these alone would not cause their regime
                            to collapse or prevent them from continuing to support the insurgency in
                            the South. And they may believe that their international political
                            position would improve if they became the object of sustained air attack
                            from the US. Accordingly, they might decide to intensify the struggle,
                            accepting the destructive consequences in the North in the expectation
                            of early victory in the South.</p>
                        <p>9. It seems to us somewhat more likely however that they would decide to
                            make some effort to secure a respite from US air attack, especially if
                            the US had indicated that such a respite would follow a sharp reduction
                            of Viet Cong activity.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">The Director of
                                Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes this course
                                of action less likely than that described in paragraph 8. He
                                considers that Hanoi would feel that any benefits to be gained by
                                such a respite would be more than offset by a loss of momentum at a
                                time when victory appeared near, by a loss of face with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and by the consequent bolstering of
                                    US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale. Hanoi would have
                                in mind that concessions under such circumstances might only invite
                                the US to resume strikes upon any renewal of Viet Cong military
                                activity.</note> We do not know how far they would go <pb xml:id="pg_323" n="323" facs="0355"/>in concessions, whether the US
                            would accept what might be offered, or what the international situation
                            might be at such a time. We think it extremely unlikely, however, that
                            Hanoi would concede so far to US demands that it would entail abandoning
                            its support of the insurgency in the South or giving up its intention of
                            unifying Vietnam under Communist control.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the assumed vigorous US attacks on major targets could easily
                            coincide with the probable use over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> of Chinese air defense from Chinese bases. If so, US
                            responses would either have been to acknowledge the privileged sanctuary
                            of Chinese bases or to strike the bases in hot pursuit, thus inviting
                            further Chinese military responses. Hanoi's persistence would be
                            reinforced either way. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        <p>10. The Chinese Communists would almost certainly be willing to support
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in even the more militant course
                            of action outlined in paragraph 8. We have set forth in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–3–65 (paragraphs 16–18, with State
                            Department footnotes of dissent) the use the Chinese would be likely to
                            make of their own forces.</p>

                        <p>11. Instead of temporarily easing off or intensifying present levels of
                            pressure, the Communist leaders might actually engage in actions which
                            would change the scale and nature of the war. These would be much more
                            dangerous and aggressive courses and, although they seem to us unlikely
                            in the light of logic and prudence, they are possibilities which cannot
                            be ignored:</p>
                        <p>a. They might launch a large-scale <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            invasion of South Vietnam and/or Laos. We think it unlikely that they
                            would do this in response to bombings of North Vietnam. They would feel
                            that at best this drastic policy would only accelerate victories in Laos
                            and Vietnam which they are confident they will win before very long
                            through less costly tactics. Such an invasion would virtually require a
                            greater involvement of the Chinese in Vietnam, which is in itself
                            distasteful to the North Vietnamese. The Communists would recognize that
                            to launch such an invasion would be to invite further major destruction
                            upon the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and perhaps upon
                                China.<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4">The Director of Intelligence and
                                Research, Department of State, believes that paragraph 11a is
                                applicable only in the initial stages of bombings in North Vietnam,
                                well below the Hanoi-Haiphong target complex. Once US attacks
                                destroy major industrial and military targets in this complex,
                                however, Hanoi will have substantially lost its hostage and suffered
                                the maximum damage it could anticipate from the air. In this case
                                the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, having suffered the

                                to send its own armed forces on a large scale to Laos and South
                                Vietnam. Hanoi might assume that the US would be unwilling to
                                undertake a major ground war, or that if it was, it could ultimately
                                be defeated by the methods which were successful against the

                            Chinese Communist ground forces into the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as “volunteers,” both to prepare for further escalation
                            and to make clear Peiping's commitment to assist the North Vietnamese.

                        <p>b. We think it unlikely that the Chinese or <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would respond to US air raids by air attacks on US
                            aircraft carriers or South Vietnamese air-fields. To do so would invite
                            counterattacks on the vulnerable Communist <pb xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0356"/>bases and start the escalation of an air war, a form of
                            hostilities most disadvantageous to the North Vietnamese and the
                            Chinese. A sneak attack on a carrier by an unidentifiable Chinese
                            submarine is a more difficult possibility to weigh, but we are inclined
                            to think the chance is slim; the risks would be fairly high and Chinese
                            confidence in the ability of their inexperienced submarine force to pull
                            it off is probably low.</p>
                        <p>c. We also think it unlikely that the Chinese Communists would start
                            another major crisis elsewhere on the periphery of China. Faced with the
                            possibility of a full scale war in Southeast Asia, Peiping would want to
                            have the greatest possible strength focused there. Chinese propaganda
                            has, indeed, said that America's “meager force” in Asia is spread thinly
                            over a “long arc from South Korea to Indochina,” and that if the
                            conflict were expanded, the “time, place, and scale of the war would be
                            beyond US control.” However, we think this is no more than a general
                            warning of the dangers of expanding the war. Peiping is likely, however,
                            to continue talking of war “over a vast front” and perhaps even to stir
                            up alarms elsewhere to keep US power dispersed and deter the US in
                            Southeast Asia. The Chinese Communists might, for example, increase the
                            apparent military threat in Korea, bombard the offshore islands in order
                            to raise tensions in the Taiwan area, or perhaps make threatening moves
                            on the borders of India.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Ingredient<note n="5" xml:id="d139fn5">Possible Soviet reactions are discussed in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–3–65. In the two following paragraphs we
                                consider only the impact of Soviet policies on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Chinese Communist reactions.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. Assuming the fairly limited Soviet involvement which we have
                            estimated, Soviet policy is not likely to have a determining impact on
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Chinese policy. The fact
                            that the Soviets have become involved at all, however, almost certainly
                            has some effect on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Chinese
                            calculations. How the Soviet involvement affects <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reactions will depend upon the extent of whatever
                            Soviet commitment has been given. If the Soviets have urged caution, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> might be somewhat more
                            restrained and flexible in its responses to US pressure than we have
                            estimated above. However, we believe it more likely that Soviet promises
                            of aid for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> defenses, along with the
                            very fact of Soviet reinvolvement will make the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leaders somewhat more confident and aggressive. They
                            may hope to benefit in their confrontation with the US from a
                            Sino-Soviet competition in backing them.</p>
                        <p>13. The probable effect on the Chinese of the increased Soviet presence
                            is certain to be complex and ambivalent. On the one hand, the Chinese
                            are almost certainly upset at an apparent Soviet move to grab a share of
                            credit for any Communist gains in Vietnam and to try to displace some of
                            Peiping's influence over the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. On the
                            other hand, they welcome <pb xml:id="pg_325" n="325" facs="0357"/>whatever additional deterrent can be laid upon the US by Soviet
                            involvement in the situation. More important, they see an opportunity to
                            force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> either to endorse the
                            Chinese line on policy toward the US or to expose itself as
                            faint-hearted in its devotion to Communist duty. Whichever choice Moscow
                            makes, Peiping expects Soviet authority to be undermined, and Chinese
                            influence strengthened, in the international Communist movement.</p>

                                    136</ref>.</note> attempted to state U.S. goals in Vietnam. He
                            reviewed these goals: we have one major objective—to save South Vietnam
                            and to help the South Vietnamese to preserve their freedom. We seek no
                            bases or territory there, and when we have responsible assurance that
                            the terrorism has stopped, we will bring our troops home immediately;
                            and until then, we will do everything we think wise to help the South
                            Vietnamese do what is necessary. The President said that we must expect
                            an increase in Viet Cong aggressive tactics and that we must recognize
                            that our own responses are likely to increase as well. He wants to make
                            it clear that the U.S. is going to continue its efforts to meet and stop
                            this aggression. Our Mission in Saigon should have no doubts whatsoever
                            as to U.S. intent and objectives.</p>

                            the southern part of North Vietnam, and he agreed this should be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that
                            there were daily evidences of an increase in Viet Cong activity in the
                            central and southern part of South Vietnam. He pointed to the Communist
                            “war vessel” that was brought into a South Vietnam port.<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">A report of this event was transmitted in telegram
                                2462 from Saigon, February 18. In telegram 2710 from Saigon,
                                February 22, the event was described as the discovery off the coast
                                of South Vietnam on February 16 of “an armed ocean-going, steel ship
                                carrying large quantities of Communist bloc arms and ammunition.”

                            increase in North Vietnamese forces in the northern part of South
                            Vietnam. He agreed that strikes this weekend against the North should
                            take place. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> went on
                            to review the international reaction to our strikes. He said that those
                            Asian countries that had a great stake in the security of the area
                            (e.g., Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Philippines) are with us; some countries (e.g., France
                            and Pakistan) are luke warm; some “unaligned” countries are flatly
                            opposed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated his misgivings with respect to an approach to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at this time. He doubted that a
                            debate in the Security Council would be the best way to deal with the
                            situation. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is the only
                            Communist country represented there, and would have a special
                            responsibility to defend the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> actions
                            and thus might adopt a less forthcoming stance than it might in another
                            forum. The Secretary felt that we should make our White Paper<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">This paper was released on February 27 and entitled
                                “Aggression from the North: The Record of North Viet-Nam's Campaign

                            we are still investigating how best to use the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> machinery.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary felt that, in the course of the next week, it may be
                            necessary to make another strong statement on our aims and objectives,
                            stating that we will move our troops as soon as we know the aggression
                            has stopped. He said there are many who think “negotiation” is a magic
                            word, but felt it would be a mistake to indicate prematurely our desire
                            to enter into negotiation; unless there was some prospect that
                            negotiations would be meaningful, it would be a very dangerous
                            situation. A negotiation that failed would indicate that we had taken
                            the case to the higher court and it was unable to deal with it. This
                            would be the worst possible situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that “political antennae” all over the world are
                            waiting for signals that the Communists are ready to engage in
                            meaningful negotiation. Thus far no significant signals have been
                            received. It is extremely important, in this respect, that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself is ready to stand up against
                            this aggression.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would rather talk than fight, but nonetheless
                            it was terribly important that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            not get the wrong impression that the U.S is seeking negotiations
                            prematurely. Under these circumstances Saigon might begin its own
                            negotiations very quickly and without our knowledge or
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>The President read the text of an outgoing message, from Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, which spelled out our proposed

                            He asked the members of the Council for their reaction. All agreed.</p>

                        <p>This is the latest information from General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> on the attempted coup in South
                                Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">A situation report on
                                developments in South Vietnam as of noon (<gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>) on February 19, prepared by <persName corresp="#p_CTJ1">Corcoran</persName>, is ibid., <gloss target="#t_NODIS1">Nodis</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_LOR1">LOR</gloss>, Vol. I.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The coup d'etat in Saigon was undertaken by military group headed by
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Phat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Tran Van Don</persName>. The composition of the
                            group is apparently essentially the same as that which attempted
                            September 13 coup less Gen. <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Duc</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Announced target of coup leaders (who speak for an organization called
                            Forces For The Protection of the Country) is to remove Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> from the scene but highly
                            probable that group desires also to change the present government headed
                            by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Coup group has support of militant Catholic elements at the moment. To
                            date, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s government has kept
                            aside from coup activities treating it as an intramural struggle among
                            military.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, with
                            concurrence of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, has suggested to Air Commodore <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> that he attempt to call urgent
                            meeting of the Armed Forces Council at Bien Hoa this evening if
                            possible, if not, earliest possible time tomorrow morning. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> also suggested that <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> inform corps and unit commanders of
                            his call for meeting and urge a standstill of troop movements in
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>Impossible to judge this moment amount and degree of support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Phat</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TVD2">Don</persName> group and for Gen. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>U.S. military advisors have been counseled to take the following position
                            with their counterparts:</p>
                        <p>a. Emphasize the necessity to avoid armed clashes and bloodshed among
                            Vietnamese Government Forces.</p>
                        <p>b. Emphasize that call for Armed Forces Council meeting is a sound
                            approach to solving difficulties. In the meantime, there should be a
                            standstill on troop movements headed for Saigon.</p>
                        <p>c. Deny that the U.S. was informed concerning the coup attempt but
                            otherwise maintain a neutral position insofar as the contending factions
                            are concerned.</p>
                        <p>d. Stress that the coup attempt following on recent U.S./<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> joint air attacks on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is most unfortunate in terms of its
                            effect on U.S. and Free World opinion.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Obviously the dominant topic is Southeast Asia and especially South
                            Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> takes the
                            immediate military disturbance calmly, although he obviously feels that
                            it reinforces his own conviction that there is not, and cannot be, any
                            workable government in a situation of “American occupation.” He
                            professes to think there is a possibility of such a government after a
                            political settlement and an American withdrawal, but he produces no
                            evidence whatever to support the notion that such a government would be
                            anything but Communist.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> told me that he thought
                            we had decided on “escalation” and that he was very fearful of the
                            results. This is what he has told others and I think it is what he
                            honestly believes. I pointed out that no one had more experience of
                            negotiation and of the settlement of political differences than you, and
                            that our current lack of interest in negotiation should not be construed
                            as willful insistence upon a violent solution. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> readily admitted—and indeed
                            volunteered—the opinion that you are a very prudent man and that you
                            have made no mistakes since November 1963—“a remarkable
                            achievement.”</p>
                        <p>3. I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> that
                            just a year ago today he had suggested to <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> in a private talk that we might have to take
                            further military action before we would be in a position to negotiate.
                            He did not deny that he had said this (the cable is at Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">Not attached and not found.</note> He simply
                            said that he thought it was now too late for such measures. In his own
                            view the dangers of action beyond the 17th Parallel outweighed any
                            possible return, and he thought we would do better to limit our
                            attention to the South. I told him that you more than any other man in
                            the government were insistent upon a maximum effort in the South, but
                            that we also had to take account of the very heavy role and
                            responsibility of Hanoi and of the problem of morale which is created
                            when there is increasing violence against our people and the Vietnamese,
                            and no visible response.</p>
                        <p>All this was standard back and forth. I then tried to make a more
                            important and less obvious point—without much success. I told him that
                            we did not think it was helpful for the French to make public calls for
                            a conference. He said that this was no more than a restatement of their
                            own <pb xml:id="pg_331" n="331" facs="0363"/>well-known position. I said
                            that any restatement was a political act, especially at a moment of
                            tension. I told him that I thought the French might have to choose
                            between having a real private diplomatic role in these matters and
                            taking the posture of public disapproval of what an ally was doing. I
                            did not see how they could do both. Couve said that France aspired to no
                            private role and that we could not object if the French stated their
                            honest opinion. This was the only sign of heat which he displayed in the
                            whole meeting.</p>
                        <p>My conclusion is that <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>
                            honestly does not think we can avoid defeat in South Vietnam. This is of
                            course a comforting conclusion for a Frenchman for obvious reasons. He
                            is not troubled by the shifting of the power balance in Southeast Asia
                            because France has no ambitions there, and he is a Frenchmen through and
                            through. He does think there is real danger in any “escalation”, and
                            since this danger might affect Europe and France, his worry is not
                            pretense. He will be reassured by anything you choose to tell him about
                            your own care and watchfulness. I think you will also see the value of
                            the argument that anything we do now will be designed to be essentially
                            continuous with our policy of insistent support for action in the South
                            and very careful and moderate and measured naval action, air patrol, and
                            so on in other areas.</p>

                            <pb xml:id="pg_332" n="332" facs="0364"/>referred to this morning's
                            events in Saigon. He had told some Senators only yesterday evening<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Presumably a reference to the Congressional
                                briefing at the White House the previous evening. (Ibid.)</note>
                            that you could never tell when there might be a new government in Saigon
                            and this morning it had happened again. There had been something like
                            ten governments in South Vietnam in the last few years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said this did not surprise
                            people any more and that it illustrated the basic problem in South
                            Vietnam, which is a political one.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Secretary of State had told him about the good
                            talks he had had with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>. He was glad the Foreign Minister had been able to
                            come. He admired <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> for
                            being able to get away with few press conferences. He himself had held
                            forty-six of them, whereas President Kennedy had held twenty-one, and
                            yet he had been told that wasn't enough.</p>
                        <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s suggestion, the
                            Foreign Minister described his talk in Paris on Saturday, February 13,
                            with the Communist Chinese Ambassador, who had just come back from
                            Peiping. After the usual accusations against the United States, he had
                            said that the thing to do in Southeast Asia was to go back to the Geneva
                            Agreement of 1954 as a basis for negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> had told him this was the French
                            position, too, but the negotiations would have to be without
                            preconditions, because their objective was to achieve a cease-fire and
                            see what could then be developed. The Chinese Ambassador had not said
                            exactly that he agreed, which would have been asking too much. However,
                            as the Ambassador left, <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> had
                            summarized their talk according to his own understanding, and had asked
                            if the Ambassador objected to any part of it, to which the Ambassador
                            had replied in the negative.<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>'s
                                conversation with the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China
                                on February 13 was one of several contacts the French Government had
                                with the People's Republic of China and North Vietnam during the
                                previous few months. For a summary and analysis of the discussions,
                                see <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said that France had some
                            commercial relations with North Vietnam but no political relations,
                            since France had diplomatic relations with South Vietnam. He said the
                            French government did not see any difference between the North
                            Vietnamese and the Chinese, except that the former are more anxious to
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The President said our information on what was happening in Southeast
                            Asia was limited. He said we did not have the best of sources available.
                            We had always felt that in order to have useful negotiations, the other
                            side must want to negotiate. We had not seen any sign of this, in fact
                            our information reflected quite the contrary. (At this point the
                            President read several passages from an intelligence report on the
                            attitude of <pb xml:id="pg_333" n="333" facs="0365"/>the North
                            Vietnamese government which we had received through a private
                                source.)<note n="4" xml:id="d144fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said it was normal that
                            Hanoi should speak in this vein for propaganda purposes, but he did not
                            think that this was the real position.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in the last fourteen months he had watched
                            problems of concern to our allies very closely and very carefully, and
                            that he had always been very cautious and had taken care not to throw
                            our weight around. Illustrating his point with reference to an
                            occasional bean ball thrown in a baseball game, he said that when these
                            had come his way he had moved his head out of the line of fire and had
                            refused to engage in quarrels with people. He had always told our own
                            people that we didn't want to get into fights needlessly. The President
                            pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and President Kennedy had told the people of
                            South Vietnam that we wanted to help them help themselves. This had
                            always been our position and he wasn't about to run out on our
                            commitment. There were two or three thousand incidents a month in South
                            Vietnam and he didn't have to tell the French what this meant as they
                            had had plenty of experience out there themselves. As the character of
                            these incidents gets more serious we respond in kind in order to make
                            our purpose clear, e.g.: when the North Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_PT1">PT</gloss> boats had been sent out against our
                            destroyers, we had bombed their bases on the North Vietnamese coast. We
                            had also shelled the attacking craft with our ships. Then the Viet Cong
                            had been sent into a US compound and had killed a number of our boys.
                            The President was not going to write them a thank-you note for this.
                            There had been up to 78 such incidents. The President wondered what
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> or <persName>Wilson</persName>
                            would do in similar circumstances. What we had done was to bomb certain
                            of their staging and assembly points. Then the following night they had
                            come and blown up a hotel and killed some more of our soldiers. So our
                            planes went back and “sprinkled them a little.” The President said he
                            didn't think we had killed many of them. In fact he thought that our
                            action had probably caused more concern in certain other parts of the
                            world than it had in North Vietnam. The President said that whenever
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> says something on
                            the Vietnamese problem, the President asks the Secretary of State or
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> to go and find
                            out exactly what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said.
                            Then he is told that the suggestion is that we ought to have a political
                            solution. The President said that he was all in favor of this but the
                            question was how to bring it about. The President said that the press
                            would like him to talk more than he does but he didn't want to. He
                            noticed that some of his colleagues talked to the press and he could
                            tell which ones had done so from little lines here and there in the
                            articles. The <pb xml:id="pg_334" n="334" facs="0366"/>President
                            repeated that our policy was to help the people of South Vietnam to help
                            themselves. We would leave tomorrow if anyone would provide effective
                            guarantees of the independence of South Vietnam. He said we would pull
                            our men out tonight if we could achieve this. The President said that we
                            were not going to give the other side a privileged sanctuary as in
                            Korea, or tell them what weapons we would use or not use against them.
                            We were going to keep them guessing and use appropriate means in
                            response to their aggression. We don't want to move to escalation, but
                            if the others do it, we will do whatever is required on the basis of the
                            wisest military judgment. We would like to have everybody else's help in
                            our efforts and we haven't had much help from others. The President said
                            that he had greatly valued President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s stand and help at the time of the Cuba crisis,
                            and had taken it into account in our relations with France. He said that
                            until we get support we will never be able to explain our alliances
                            satisfactorily to the American people. He said that we might have to
                            leave South Vietnam for some reason but we hoped not. We welcomed the
                            help and the counsel of everyone. If the North Vietnamese think that
                            they hold all the trump cards and that they have the backing of world
                            opinion, then they are misjudging the situation and us, just like Hitler
                            and the</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he fully understood the feelings expressed by
                            the President. The essential problem was: how to get out. He felt that
                            there was a complete contradiction between our respective information on
                            the thinking of the Chinese and North Vietnamese. The French
                            Government's information differed from ours.</p>

                        <p>The President said he had heard that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> says what we ought to do. He said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is a great man, and that we
                            are grateful that there are not as many changes of government in France
                            as in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The President said he would
                            like to hear from him what he thinks we ought to do, with points a. b.
                            c.</p>
                        <p>(At this point there was some comment by the President on what General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> really recommended
                            with regard to the use of strength. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> explained this point to the
                            President.)</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the statement which the President had read
                            was pure propaganda, and was too stupid.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said the French government believed in a political
                            solution. According to its information, the other side wants to
                            negotiate. On the other hand, US information is that they don't.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked whether the position of the other
                            side was that the United States should withdraw first and then
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied in the negative. He said that US withdrawal
                            was their ultimate objective, but they said that we should all go back
                            to the 1954 Geneva agreements first, in order to negotiate. They did not
                            ask for withdrawal as the first step. The Foreign Minister said that the
                            role of the ChiComs was far more important than that of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it was the feeling of the Foreign Minister that if
                            we got an agreement it would be worth anything.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister answered that the most important factor was what
                            kind of a government there would be in South Vietnam. He admitted that
                            this was a risk which one would probably have to take. It was not
                            possible to tell what the nature of a South Vietnamese government would
                            be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked whether France felt
                            that any government likely to emerge would be dominated by Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that nobody could say.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> interjected that
                            Belgrade was not Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to the problem
                            of the other states in the general area of Southeast Asia: Laos,
                            Thailand, Burma, Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>The President said that success by the Chinese would be likely to
                            increase their appetite.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the main issue was the question of
                            relations between the United States and China. China could not fail to
                            be impressed by the immense power of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to his talk with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on June 5,
                                1964.<note n="5" xml:id="d144fn5">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01">

                                    464–470</ref>.</note> He thought that a major difference between
                            our two governments was in our respective assessment of the intentions
                            of Communist China. France thought that it was preoccupied with major
                            internal problems and thus looked inward on itself, whereas we think
                            that the Chinese are aggressive and land hungry.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_336" n="336" facs="0368"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that another difference was that
                            France seems to think that there can be no solution to the problem of
                            stable government in South Vietnam while the United States remains
                            there, while we think that there can be no solution if we leave.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that government stability was impossible to
                            achieve in a period of hostilities, but that if a cease-fire could be
                            achieved, then, with the US staying in South Vietnam, internal
                            conditions could be expected to change.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> commented that
                            another difference was that France thinks that negotiations would last a
                            very long time, whereas we thought that a conference would be likely to
                            break up.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that in estimating the probable course which
                            the Communist Chinese government would take, it was useful to look at
                            the Soviet example. He recalled that the Soviet Union had stayed quiet
                            until World War II and had only started its expansionist policies at
                            that time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Chinese
                            expansionism had already been active in Africa. The Foreign Minister
                            said this was different: before the war there had been activity in other
                            countries by the Communist parties.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that
                            Communist China proclaimed its belief in militant support of indigenous
                            movements, and that this raised the question of how it could be expected
                            to retreat.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that if the Chinese once agreed to come to the
                            negotiating table, it would then be harder for them to resume
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what was the French evaluation of the Soviet thinking
                            on these matters.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister answered that the Russians had the same evaluation
                            as the French, and that they constituted a moderating element. The
                            Russians didn't want to see the Communist Chinese expand, and would
                            support North Vietnam against China.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the question of press guidance was discussed, and it was
                            agreed that the Foreign Minister would say that he had talked about
                            various subjects with the President, including South Vietnam. The
                            Foreign Minister said that in reply to any further questions he would
                            refer the press to the White House.</p>

                            what you might say to him if you wish to telephone him. In the current
                            situation, I do not think such a phone call is urgent.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_338" n="338" facs="0370"/>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> suggests an early
                            Presidential statement. Your answer is that you believe in all necessary
                            statements of our policy and objectives—that you have stated them
                            repeatedly—and that you have told the Secretary of State to hold a press
                            conference or issue a statement at any time in the next days or weeks
                            that he may think it necessary. You yourself do not wish to heat up the
                            national or international atmosphere by making a very loud noise right
                            now, although you are free to change your mind if the situation requires
                            it.</p>
                        <p>2. You do not wish to indicate our “readiness for exploratory talks” at
                            this time. Our position is not one in which we should now look as if we
                            were hunting negotiations. Both the Communists and our friends in Saigon
                            would interpret such a proposal as a sign of weakness and readiness to
                            withdraw.</p>
                        <p>3. You share his view that we do not wish to get into the Security
                            Council right now.</p>
                        <p>4. You do not think that we would now wish to organize a meeting of the
                            US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, China, the Soviet Union,
                            and North and South Vietnam. Such a committee would be weighted against
                            us, and there is no reason today to offer the French the mediator role
                            in this conspicuous way.</p>

                        <p>1763. 1. Vietnamese Embassy informed us this morning Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> making statement before U.S.
                            television cameras supporting the military coup. <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> ticker subsequently carried <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>'s announcement his full support
                            for “military revolt against General <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nguyen
                                Khanh</persName>.” <pb xml:id="pg_339" n="339" facs="0371"/>Item
                            said if coup succeeded <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>
                            would return to Saigon at invitation coup leaders to give whatever help
                            he could in returning country to stability. Further said <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> assailed <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> as “dictator who created
                            disorder in order to stay in power”. Added he had received message from

                            that he get back to Saigon as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>2. However coup turns out we hope Quat government can be preserved. This
                            is not to argue any long term U.S. commitment to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> as individual. However, it would
                            be regrettable to have his government fall so soon after establishment
                            leaving us again with indefinite interim period of disorganization and
                            travail of working out installation successor regime. It obviously to

                            reentered the capital, reoccupied the Radio Station and the Regional
                            Force Headquarters and gave the Fifth Armored Group troops 30 minutes to

                        <p>At about 7:03 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reported General <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>, with the concurrence of
                            General <hi rend="italic">Ky</hi>, was calling an Armed Forces Council
                            meeting at Bien Hoa and had requested U.S. transportation. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> authorized this
                            and also the use of T-39 at Da Nang to transport General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> on space available basis to Bien
                            Hoa.</p>
                        <p>By 7:10 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reported troops under General
                                <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> of III Corps entering
                            the city from four directions. The coup leaders were attempting to open
                            negotiations. It was not clear just who represented the government or
                            who represented General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.
                            Four Corps Commanders seemed to be together in opposing the coup.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> seemed to be in
                            charge of military operations while Generals <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>
                            presumably were handling negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> was floating in the background issuing orders and
                            appearing to be increasingly in control. However there was a possibility
                            that any meeting of officers convoked to settle the coup could turn
                            against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> around the
                            conference table although <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> did not
                            consider this likely on the basis of the past record. General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> took off from Da Nang for Bien Hoa
                            in a <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> C-47 at 6:30 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>By 8:15 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> were reporting that the coup had completely collapsed.
                            Also Radio Saigon announced its return to normal operations and was no
                            longer broadcasting rebel statements.</p>
                        <p>At 8:55 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss> it was reported that
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and other
                            civilian members of the government would attend the Bien Hoa meeting.
                            The purpose of the meeting would be to settle the coup. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> was at Nha Trang
                            preparing to preside over a victory celebration related to the capture
                            of the Viet Cong arms ship near Cape Varella. He recommended that
                            journalists and ICC representatives be brought to the scene.</p>
                        <p>By 11:05 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reported the military phase of the
                            coup was apparently over. General <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Phat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Ton1">Colonel
                                Ton</persName> had been seen changing into civilian clothes and
                            departing in a civilian auto.</p>
                        <p>At 11:10 p.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reported that the Armed Forces
                            Council meeting at Bien Hoa had voted “no confidence” in General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> had left the meeting so that
                            Council members could speak freely. At about 1:15 a.m. <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss> Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> confirmed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that the Council had voted “no
                            confidence” in <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and had
                            also decided that the insurgents should be tried and punished by the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>Another Council decision, according to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, was to make General <persName corresp="#p_NCT1">Nguyen Chanh Thi</persName> Commander of the Capital Military
                            District (Saigon) replacing General <persName corresp="#p_PVD2">Pham Van
                                Dong</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName> however is still serving as a member of the Armed
                            Forces Council.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> agreed to discuss with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> the question
                            of naming <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s replacement
                            as Commander in Chief, indicating that <persName corresp="#p_PKS1">Phan
                                Khac Suu</persName>'s decree removing <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> still stands. The Ambassador <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341" facs="0373"/>is inclined to share General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s view that no successor
                            as Commander in Chief is necessary and that it would be preferable to
                            have only a Minister of Defense and a Chief of Staff of the Armed
                            Forces.</p>
                        <p>Major General <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Nguyen van Thieu</persName> as
                            Minister of the Armed Forces and Acting Commander in Chief appears to be
                            top figure in the Armed Forces Council in the absence of <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and the most likely inheritor
                            of leadership of the armed forces.</p>

                                the first Rolling Thunder bombing strike be carried out on February
                                22 since the internal situation in South Vietnam seemed to be
                                stabilizing. In telegram 2665 from Saigon, February 19, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had recommended that
                                Rolling Thunder I, scheduled for February 20, be postponed in view
                                of the attempted coup in Saigon. The Department of State indicated
                                its acceptance of <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                                recommendation in telegram 1757 to Saigon, February 19. All three

                            further operation might jeopardize Sov reaction, and we have now asked

                        <p>Apropos the appearance of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> on TV at the moment of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_Harlech1">Harlech</persName>'s arrival, the
                            Secretary told the Ambassador that the French appear much more persuaded
                            than we that Hanoi is anxious to work out the difficulties in Viet-Nam.
                            The Secretary remarked that this would no doubt be on Hanoi's own terms
                            even if they are indeed ready to negotiate, and he added that in his
                            view the French are not really deeply concerned with how problems are
                            resolved in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador agreed that the French are out of the area for
                            good. He inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>
                            had tended in recent conversations to minimize the importance of the
                            support and direction by North Viet-Nam of the Viet Cong effort. The
                            Secretary said the French had not pressed this point but in any case he
                            had given them at length yesterday the evidence on the North Vietnamese
                            ship just recently captured in South Viet-Nam waters, loaded with
                            arms.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_Harlech1">Harlech</persName> then referred to
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Soviet conversations in Moscow and
                            relayed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>'s
                            conviction that any public statement made on this subject would promptly
                            blow up the whole effort. The British are persuaded that the Soviets do
                            want seriously to consider the British proposal but insist on no
                            publicity at this stage. It is clear from what <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName> has said that the Soviets are not
                            ruling out some joint public statement at a later date. It is the
                            British assessment that if there were a leak now the Soviets would
                            immediately make a militantly hostile statement ruling out any
                            possibility of a joint effort.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary assured the British Ambassador that in giving Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> a little background on
                            this subject he had stressed to him the necessity for absolute silence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>, he said, had agreed
                            that it would be advantageous if the Russians were prepared to play
                            their <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairman role in the
                            Vietnamese situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">See <ref target="#d144fn6">footnote 6, Document 144</ref>.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> then reviewed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>'s
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName>, noting
                            that at the outset the latter had accepted the British formula about the
                            status of the <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairmen with
                            regard to the 1954 Accords on Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName> had also promised seriously to study the British
                            proposal even though <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>
                            surmised that there was some disappointment that the British were not
                            suggesting a conference. While <persName corresp="#p_LSG1">Lapin</persName> mentioned that the Soviets had already had
                            submitted to them views from the French and North Vietnamese, they were
                            nevertheless ready to consider the British proposal for requesting views
                            from the other countries. <persName corresp="#p_Harlech1">Harlech</persName> said that his estimate was that there would be a
                            reply from the Soviets in two to three days. He also assured the
                            Secretary that all of the US suggestions about the approach to the
                            Soviets, including the bringing in of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> countries, had been accepted and acted on by the
                            British.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then referred to the
                            difficult question posed by <persName corresp="#p_TSH1">Trevelyan</persName>'s judgment opposing any further strikes at
                            this time. The Secretary observed that as long as the current confusion
                            in Saigon exists we would not be inclined to lay on a strike. On the
                            other hand the capture of the North Vietnamese arms ship almost begs for
                            a response. He acknowledged the pressure on the Russians which a strike
                            would represent but emphasized that London and Moscow must not believe
                            that embarking on the <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairman
                            process would be accompanied by a unilateral cease-fire by the US. When
                            the British Ambassador said it was the conviction of London and their
                            Embassy in Moscow that another strike at this time would doom the
                            British initiative with the Soviets, the Secretary added that it was not
                            his expectation that a decision would be made today concerning a further
                            strike and he promised the British advance <pb xml:id="pg_345" n="345" facs="0377"/>warning on this subject. He noted nevertheless that we
                            do not regard this connection between a strike and the British
                            initiative in Moscow as a really decisive element in our decision.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_Harlech1">Harlech</persName> said the
                            British saw real value in getting a clear Russian reaction at this time.
                            It is most important to learn what we can of their purposes and get
                            whatever evidence we can of their readiness to play a mediating role and
                            help avoid escalation. He said that his Government urged the US strongly
                            to hold its hand until the British have an answer from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the Soviets may come back and state that
                            the end of US strikes is a precondition to their playing the <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>-Chairman role as suggested by the
                            British. In this case the Secretary assumed that the British would make
                            sure that into the ensuing consideration there would also be the demand
                            for North Viet-Nam to put an end to infiltration. In this regard the
                            Secretary referred to the British position in Malaysia which would
                            envisage reaction against Indonesia in response to rather less
                            provocation and he emphasized how the arms ship illustrates the nature
                            of the North Vietnamese role. In conclusion, however, he stated again
                            there would be no strike today or tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OGDLH1">Lord Harlech</persName> acknowledged that
                            the US cannot agree to a unilateral cease-fire and he also referred,
                            himself, to the arms ship as “straight aggression.”</p>

                            Situation Report for Vietnam as of 1600 hours <gloss target="#t_EST1">EST</gloss>, 21 February:</p>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is resisting
                            his ouster as Commander-in-Chief, officially announced by Saigon Radio
                            today, and is attempting to rally behind him whatever forces he can
                            muster. Late Sunday night<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">February
                                21.</note> (Saigon time) some 15 tanks and two truckloads of
                            rangers, apparently acting on <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s <pb xml:id="pg_346" n="346" facs="0378"/>behalf,
                            occupied Saigon's airfield of Tan Son Nhut. The situation has been
                            characterized chiefly by maneuvering and confusion, and is still far
                            from certain how much actual support <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might secure in a showdown. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is at his seaside command post
                            at Vung Tau, southeast of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>2. The Armed Forces Council has issued an ultimatum to <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> to leave the country
                            immediately. General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>, I Corps
                            Commander, who is emerging as perhaps the most powerful of the young
                            Turks, has warned that any forces attempting to reinstate <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> would be subjected to air
                            strikes.</p>
                        <p>3. A field appraisal of the loyalties of key military commanders shows an
                            almost complete lineup against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_Dong1">Dong</persName>, Military Governor of Saigon and strongly
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, estimates that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> might at most be
                            supported in the capital by three airborne and one marine battalion.
                            However, as in the case of the 19–20 February attempted coup, there
                            always exists some danger of split loyalties developing among individual
                            field units.</p>
                        <p>4. Yesterday, the Armed Forces Council deputized General <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>, II Corps Commander, to find
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and tell him of its
                            no-confidence vote. When <persName corresp="#p_CO1">Co</persName>
                            finally caught up with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            upcountry in Nha Trang, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            refused to accept the message. He claimed that the vote was taken at a
                            rump session of the Armed Forces Council, and he insisted on the right
                            to defend himself before the total membership.</p>
                        <p>5. On the afternoon of 21 February, the Armed Forces Council voted to
                            name Major General <persName corresp="#p_TVMLM1">Tran Van (Little)
                                Minh</persName>, erstwhile Chief of Staff, as temporary armed forces
                            commander. A formal decree to this effect was signed by Chief of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and broadcast Sunday
                            night.</p>
                        <p>6. Of the key military figures, only Navy Commander Admiral Cang at
                            latest word is remaining with <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> at Vung Tau, and Cang's intentions and loyalties
                            are not clear. General <persName>Quang</persName>, Special Forces
                            Commander, earlier thought to be on <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s side, now says he wants out and has asked for a
                            plane to take him from Vung Tau. General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> is arranging transport. Thus, while the situation is
                            still subject to sudden change, the trend seems to be running against
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>.</p>

                            deployments to this area in view of security situation of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and I agree that there is no need to
                            consider deployments to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> at this time
                            except possibly for protection of airfield at Danang.</p>
                        <p>As I analyze the pros and cons of placing any considerable number of
                            Marines in Danang area beyond those presently assigned, I develop grave
                            reservations as to wisdom and necessity of so doing. Such action would
                            be step in reversing long standing policy of avoiding commitment of
                            ground combat forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Once this
                            policy is breached, it will be very difficult to hold line. If Danang
                            needs better protection, so do Bien Hoa, Ton Son Nhut, Nha Trang and
                            other key base areas. Once it becomes evident that we are willing to
                            assume such new responsibilities, one may be sure that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will seek to unload other ground force
                            tasks upon us. Increased numbers of ground forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> will increase points of friction with
                            local population and create conflicts with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> over command relationships. These disadvantages can
                            be accepted only if there is clear and unchallenged need which can be
                            satisfied only by US ground forces. Turning to possible uses for
                            additional Marines in Danang area, I can see several which are worth
                            examining. First, they could be used to reinforce protection of Danang
                            Air Base against Bien Hoa-type of attack by fire or against combined
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> fire and ground attack.</p>
                        <p>More ambitious mission would be readiness to engage in mobile operations
                            against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in Danang area to keep <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units at distance from base and make
                            positive contribution to pacification of area. Such US forces would
                            concurrently be available to join in conventional defense of area if
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Army moved southward in
                            resumption of formal hostilities.</p>
                        <p>In defense of the Danang Airbase against surprise attack by fire, it
                            would be necessary for Marines to be in place on ground in considerable
                            strength. (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has estimated that
                            about six battalions would be necessary to keep 81mm mortar fire off
                            large airfield.) Even if whole <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss> were
                            deployed, they could not provide complete assurance that surprise mortar
                            fire by small groups attacking at night would be kept off field.
                            Protection <pb xml:id="pg_348" n="348" facs="0380"/>of field against
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ground attack would be
                            considerably simpler and would require fewer Marines. It is hard to
                            imagine an attack on field by more than <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> regiment and even an attack in those numbers would be
                            extremely risky in face of superior friendly air and ground fire. To
                            meet such an attack, battalion of Marines supported by local <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces should be sufficient. On other
                            hand, as indicated above, effective perimeter defense against mortar
                            fire would require at least whole brigade of Marines.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that an ancillary benefit to deployment of
                            additional Marines to Danang would be freeing of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units for use elsewhere in mobile
                            operations. While some <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops on
                            order of battalion might be so relieved, number would not be sufficient
                            to constitute strong argument for bringing in Marines. Generally
                            speaking, Marines would be performing task which has not been done
                            adequately in past.</p>
                        <p>The use of Marines in mobile counter-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            operations has the attraction of giving them an offensive mission and
                            one of far greater appeal than that of mere static defense. However, it
                            would raise many serious problems which in past have appeared
                            sufficiently formidable to lead to rejection of use of US ground troops
                            in a counter-guerrilla role. White-faced soldier armed, equipped and
                            trained as he is is not suitable guerrilla fighter for Asian forests and
                            jungles. French tried to adapt their forces to this mission and failed;
                            I doubt that US forces could do much better. Furthermore, we would have
                            vastly complicating factor of not running war and hence problem of
                            arranging satisfactory command relationships with our Vietnamese allies.
                            Finally, there would be ever present question of how foreign soldier
                            would distinguish between a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and
                            friendly Vietnamese farmer. When I view this array of difficulties, I am
                            convinced that we should adhere to our past policy of keeping our ground
                            forces out of direct counterinsurgency role.</p>
                        <p>If there were any great likelihood of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            forces crossing the demilitarized zone in conventional attack, there
                            would be no question of need for strong US ground force to assist <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in defense of coastal plain. However,
                            this situation would not arise suddenly and we should have ample time to
                            make our deployments before situation got out of hand.</p>
                        <p>In view of foregoing considerations, I conclude that only mission worth
                            considering now for additional Marines in Danang area is to contribute
                            to defense of base against mortar fire and ground attack. However, to
                            defend against mortar fire would require at least full brigade and I do
                            not believe threat and possible consequences of mortar attack are so
                            great as to warrant pinning down so valuable force in static defensive
                            mission. However, in view of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s understandable concern for safety of this
                            important base, I would be willing to recommend placing in Danang Marine
                            battalion landing team. Such force <pb xml:id="pg_349" n="349" facs="0381"/>would strengthen defense of base and, at same time,
                            would be manageable force from point of view of accommodating it on base
                            and absorbing it into Danang community. Such force with those Marines
                            already present should remove any substantial danger of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ground attack and in conjunction with
                            available <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces provide an
                            acceptable level of security against attack by fire.</p>
                        <p>If Washington decision is to introduce additional Marines into Danang, it
                            should, of course, be made contingent upon getting concurrence of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It would be useful and, I believe, not
                            difficult to get <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to initiate request
                            for additional forces to which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could

                            since I came to this post: A new government installed, a coup attempted
                            against the Commander-in-Chief, the coup suppressed, the
                            Commander-in-Chief deposed by those who had put down the coup. The coup
                            attempt itself was an ill-considered, ill-timed move against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> by a group of officers and
                            former officers, many of whom had already been discredited by their
                            earlier unsuccessful attempt against <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> last September 13. One might have expected that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Phat</persName>, the coup leader,
                            would have done better on a second go but he again misjudged the temper
                            of the military commanders having effective military strength in the <pb xml:id="pg_350" n="350" facs="0382"/>Saigon area. <persName corresp="#p_LVPG1">Phat</persName>'s unsuccessful effort did have
                            the effect, however, of breaking <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s spell over his colleagues in the Armed Forces
                            Council and of bringing them to a decision to unseat him. This action
                            appears to have been successful and <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>'s conversation
                                with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> on February 22
                                regarding <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s future
                                status was reported in telegram 2700 from Saigon, February 22.
                                (Ibid., Central Files, POL 15–1 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> has just been announced. I understand that he
                            will depart Saigon for Hong Kong on 25 February: but one cannot exclude
                            the possibility of his making another last minute maneuver to save
                            himself.</p>
                        <p>With <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, the troublemaker,
                            removed from the scene, we hope that the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government can get under way with our joint
                            programs. We believe that the government has considerable potential but
                            its basic strength will not be known until put to the test. That test is
                            likely to be a challenge by the Buddhist Institute where <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> is presently making

                            objection the Institute can find in the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government, the members of which were carefully
                            chosen with a view to their acceptability to the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>The excitement over the coup tended to divert attention somewhat from the
                            Viet Cong munitions ship sunk off the coast of Phu Yen Province. The
                            cargo of this ship furnishes by far the most dramatic evidence of Hanoi
                            involvement yet uncovered in the war. An incomplete count of the cargo
                            and nearby caches indicates that some 4,000 weapons, large quantities of
                            ammunition and some 500 pounds of medicines were captured. The weapons
                            and ammunitions were [from] the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Communist China; Hanoi packing slips
                            were found in the medical containers, which include supplies
                            manufactured in North Vietnam, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria
                            and Japan. This discovery is particularly timely in terms of justifying
                            the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air strikes against North
                            Vietnamese military targets.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong activity was down during the week but pacification conditions
                            remain unsatisfactory in many provinces, particularly in Binh Dinh and
                            Phu Yen. The deteriorating security situation in this latter area has
                            required a cut back in our economic programs, since <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> representatives are generally unable
                            to leave the principal towns. We can hardly expect to reverse the
                            situation in central Vietnam until the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government is able to increase its operational
                            military and paramilitary strength.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would be willing to
                            recommend placing a Marine <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss> at Da
                            Nang.</p>
                        <p>2. In view of the great importance of the Da Nang air base to current
                            U.S. strategy, augmentation of U.S. security forces is desirable
                            soonest. Before the Marine engineers can start preparations for Hawk
                            battery on hill 3un [garble] security of site is mandatory. Adequate
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> forces are not available for this
                            purpose without detracting from other important missions.</p>
                        <p>3. To avoid further delay, I recommend at this juncture the immediate
                            deployment of one reinforced <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>
                            augmented by a small headquarters to assume control of all Marines

                            Da Nang, the Hawk Battalion, and the <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>. Reinforcement would consist of the helicopter squadron of

                        <p>1. Source of Information. On February 2, the French Foreign Office filled
                            us in on French contacts with Hanoi and Peiping, mostly in Paris, but on
                            one occasion in Peiping. A similar fill-in was given on February 17,
                            just prior to <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>'s departure
                            for Washington, and this covered <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>'s talk with the ChiCom Ambassador on February 13,
                            to which <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> referred in his
                            talk with the President on February 19th. The reporting cables are Paris
                            4295, 4390, 4445, and 4692,<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">All four cables

                        </p>
                        <p>We have no information of any other French contacts with either Communist
                            country in recent months. Our supposition is that the French have
                            informed us fully, although there are significant differences in
                            interpretation from one French talk with us to another. Notably,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> in his talk with the
                            President was much more optimistic about ChiCom views than the French
                            Foreign Office source who reported to us separately on the same February
                            13 conversation.</p>
                        <p>2. Dates and Places of Contact. The French talked in Paris with the Hanoi
                            economic delegate, Bo, on December 22 and January 20. They have talked
                            to the ChiComs in Paris on December 17, January 15 and 25, and February
                            13, and the French Ambassador in Peiping talked to ChiCom Foreign
                            Minister Chen Yi on January 9.</p>
                        <p>3. French Talks with Hanoi. The French have put three questions:</p>
                        <p>a. Would Hanoi accept and join in guarantees for a neutral and completely
                            independent South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>b. Would Hanoi agree to knock off political and military subversion in
                            South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>c. Would Hanoi accept some control mechanism more serious and with wider
                            checks than the present <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>The French have reported that Bo showed considerable interest in a and c
                            but was evasive on b.</p>
                        <p>As to a, Bo was quoted as saying that such a settlement would require
                            bilateral negotiations and the resumption of relations between the two
                            Viet-Nams, as well as wider international guarantees and a control
                            mechanism.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_353" n="353" facs="0385"/>
                        <p>As to b, Bo has refused to admit Hanoi's activities in South Viet-Nam,
                            but has said that “what was needed was an honorable compromise based on
                            real forces present in Viet-Nam.” For some reason, the French interpret
                            this statement—which would seem much more likely to mean legalization of
                            the Liberation Front—to indicate some sympathy with a bilateral
                            withdrawal of external forces from South Viet-Nam as the basis for
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Hanoi representative has at no time stated that he was speaking on
                            instructions from Hanoi. The French have pressed him for an official
                            statement of Hanoi's position, but he has not produced it. The French
                            Foreign Office, in its last briefing to us, nonetheless believes (for
                            some unstated reason) that Hanoi in fact approved Bo's replies on points
                            a (affirmative but general) and c (affirmative but avoiding any
                            specifics). The last French report on February 17 indicated that the
                            French Foreign Office “believes further clarification Hanoi position
                            required.”</p>
                        <p>It is extremely hard to make anything of Bo's reported comments. The lack
                            of Hanoi express authority for his statements, plus the fact that there
                            have been no reported contacts since February 7 and 11, make the reading
                            from these contacts extremely obscure at this time. It certainly cannot
                            be said that the contacts—which were apparently at French
                            initiative—have produced any serious indication of Hanoi's attitude or
                            terms. Nonetheless, because of their interpretation of Bo's statements,
                            as indicated above, the French have told us they think Hanoi's position
                            is somewhat more forthcoming than Peiping's.</p>
                        <p>4. French Talks with Peiping. The French have stated that these were
                            initiated by the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Initially, the ChiCom representative called for a unilateral withdrawal
                            of the US from South Viet-Nam as the only basis for settlement. They
                            also attacked the position the US had taken in the Warsaw Talks as
                            purely propagandistic.</p>
                        <p>On January 15, the ChiCom representative, on instruction from Peiping,
                            had asked whether France would assume a more active role in Viet-Nam and
                            would approach the US with a view to discussing a negotiated settlement.
                            In both of the first talks, the French put to the ChiCom representative
                            the same three questions they had addressed to the Hanoi representative.
                            The ChiComs had evaded any precise reply to these, and the conversation
                            since then has apparently revolved around whether there might be a
                            reconvened conference and whether any preconditions were required for
                            this purpose.</p>
                        <p>On this point, in the January 15 conference the ChiComs allegedly did not
                            reject the idea of a conference but said that US bellicosity and desire
                            to extend the war made it impossible to propose a conference. (They also
                            complained of the Korean troops going to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.)</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_354" n="354" facs="0386"/>
                        <p>On February 13, the ChiCom Ambassador—to <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>—pointed to the US attacks as showing US
                            bellicosity and contradicting the French assurance that the US did not
                            wish to extend the war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> replied that the French
                            still thought a conference should be convened without prior conditions
                            and that its first task should be a cease-fire. The ChiCom Ambassador
                            allegedly responded “positively” but went on to say that the US had now
                            introduced a new element by attacking North Viet-Nam and that a halt to
                            this aggression constituted a new prior condition for a conference.</p>
                        <p>The French believe that the ChiComs were thus moving away from their
                            propaganda position that there must be a total US withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> before negotiation. (This same theme
                            was apparently covered between the French Ambassador and Chen Yi on
                            January 9, in which Chen Yi had said that such a total US withdrawal was
                            not a prior condition to negotiation but might be a goal thereof.)</p>
                        <p>In summary there has been no Chinese response to the basic three points,
                            and it is by no means clear that the ChiComs are not insisting on a
                            cessation of attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as a
                            precondition to any conference. In his talk with the President,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said that the ChiCom
                            Ambassador could hardly have been expected to agree verbally with the
                            French position for a conference without preconditions, and <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> seems to draw the conclusion that
                            the ChiComs would in fact now accept a conference. However, it seems
                            absolutely clear that their objective in such a conference would be, at
                            a minimum, to obtain total US withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and there is no indication in any of the French
                            contacts with the ChiComs that they even admit North Viet-Nam's role or
                            would set up its cessation as an acceptable quid pro quo for US
                            withdrawal. The Chinese position, as stated to the French, seems to be
                            that we must stop attacking the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            before there can be any negotiation, and that we must agree, in any
                            negotiation, to get out of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. This is
                            hardly a very promising or forthcoming position!</p>
                        <p>5. References to US Position. The French tell us that they have not
                            purported to speak for the US in any of these contacts. However, they
                            have made clear to our Embassy that they believe they understand the US
                            position correctly, as being acceptable to a neutral <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with adequate assurances and solid
                            guarantees. Prior to the two most recent ChiCom contacts, the French
                            indicated that they had read with great care the reference to
                            negotiations in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                            Bundy</persName>'s speech of January 23.<note n="4" xml:id="d156fn4">See

                            Since this may now be the basis of French representation of US views,
                            the relevant paragraph is as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_355" n="355" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>“As to the basic alternatives, so long as South Viet-Nam is ready to
                            carry on the fight, withdrawal is unthinkable. A negotiation that
                            produced a return to the essentials of the 1954 Accords and thus an
                            independent and secure South Viet-Nam would of course be an answer,
                            indeed the answer. But negotiation would hardly be promising that
                            admitted Communism to South Viet-Nam, that did not get Hanoi out, or
                            that exposed South Viet-Nam and perhaps other countries of the area to
                            renewed Communist aggression at will, with only nebulous or remote
                            guarantees.”</p>

                        <p>It seems desirable and timely for me to put down an outline of my own
                            thinking about a comprehensive approach to our effort to assure the
                            security of South Viet Nam. I am convinced that there is no single
                            miracle-working approach which can get the job done. I am convinced that
                            it would be disastrous for the United States and the free world to
                            permit Southeast Asia to be overrun by the Communist North. I am also
                            convinced that everything possible should be done to throw back the
                            Hanoi-Viet Cong aggression without a major war if possible. We cannot
                            accomplish this result without the risk of major escalation; but the
                            other side, too, must face and worry about the same risk.</p>

                            Vietnamese to the establishment of a government and leadership which not
                            only is stable but looks stable. Without the elementary platform, other
                            efforts in the military and political field are likely to prove
                            fruitless. <pb xml:id="pg_356" n="356" facs="0388"/>Political confusion
                            in Saigon (a) diverts military leaders away from their main job of

                            and its Communist allies that if they persist in their present course of

                            confusion in Saigon makes it almost impossible to activate political

                            both publicly and in their actions that, at long last, they are prepared
                            to put aside personal rivalries and work together for the security of
                            South Viet Nam. Every effort should be made to obtain public

                        <p>The gravity of the present situation in South Viet Nam, as well as the
                            gravity of the decisions with which the United States is faced, calls
                            for maximum effort on the part of the South Vietnamese. The slightest
                            acceptance of a “business as usual” situation is not consistent with the
                            possibility of an explosion into larger hostilities nor with the
                            experience of other guerrilla actions in Greece, Malaysia and elsewhere.
                            Apart from the governmental question, discussed above, the South
                            Vietnamese should undertake (a) additional measures of mobilization, (b)
                            the organization of the civilian population into a pacification effort,
                            with emphasis upon information and intelligence, (c) vigorous execution
                            by the South Vietnamese of agreed psychological warfare programs, on
                            which the South Vietnamese have been dilatory and ineffective, (d)

                            day and 7-day week. It should be made clear that intensified South
                            Vietnamese efforts should not be limited by budgetary considerations or
                            US financial and material support.</p>

                        <p>We ourselves should consider whether there are additional steps which we
                            ought to take in South Viet Nam. Apart from the political results which
                            increased efforts might achieve, we should think of the importance of
                            conveying a signal to Hanoi and Peiping that they themselves cannot hope
                            to succeed without a substantial escalation on their part, with all of
                            the risks which they would have to face. I would favor the immediate
                            stationing in Da Nang of a Marine battalion combat team, to be
                            reinforced promptly to a brigade if the security situation calls for it.
                            I would also favor the use of US Naval forces, particularly destroyers,

                            repetitions of seaborne Viet Cong supply similar to the recent ship
                            discovered in Vung Ro Bay. US destroyers could assist <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> junks and other craft in systematic
                            surveillance of those portions of the seacoast not securely in
                            government hands. They could act as command ships for flotillas of
                            smaller craft to intensify and tighten surveillance of junk traffic
                            coming both from the North and Cambodia. Our military authorities should
                            be asked to be certain that every possible step is being taken for the
                            security of key installations, such as intensive patrolling and the
                            dispersal of the living quarters of American personnel. The military
                            should be asked to look again at the applicability of our most
                            sophisticated conventional weapons, some of which are still highly
                            classified and have not been used. We should continue to permit US
                            aircraft of all types to engage in direct action against the Viet Cong

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Strikes into North Viet Nam</p>
                        <p>For the present, strikes into North Viet Nam should be considered as
                            serving the political purpose of indicating to the North that they
                            cannot expect to rely upon a sanctuary in the face of their increased
                            infiltration and operations in South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>In this respect, they play their part alongside of <gloss target="#t_MAROPS1">MAROPS</gloss> and our air missions in Laos. The
                            more air strikes against North Viet Nam can be directly linked to
                            specific events in South Viet Nam, the better from a general political
                            point of view. If, at a given moment, there are political reasons for
                            deferring a strike (such as political confusion in Saigon or a major
                            international political contact), we should not bind ourselves to a
                            specific schedule. A strike directly related to the full examination of
                            the <pb xml:id="pg_358" n="358" facs="0390"/>evidence of the ship at
                            Vung Ro Bay would involve smaller political difficulties than one not so
                            related. To the extent that strikes can be specifically related to
                            events in South Viet Nam, the responsibility for major escalation will
                            continue to rest with the other side.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Political Possibilities</p>
                        <p>Obviously, the United States should be ready to take advantage of any
                            political possibility of bringing the fighting in Southeast Asia to an
                            end consistent with the security of South Viet Nam and of Laos. The
                            international political objective should be to bring about a cessation
                            of infiltration and the repatriation of those previously infiltrated.
                            This would include, of course, assured compliance with the Geneva
                            Accords of 1962 on Laos. Negotiation as a cover for the abandonment of
                            Southeast Asia to the Communist North cannot be accepted. This is a
                            weakness of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            attitude. A formal and public negotiation at this time which would
                            simply register the impossibility of a peaceful settlement would add
                            even greater dangers to the present situation. Our problem is to bring
                            about a combination of circumstances in which negotiations can achieve
                            the abandonment of aggression by Hanoi and Peiping. We have no reliable
                            evidence that Hanoi and Peiping are prepared for any such result. The
                            attitude of the Soviet Union is somewhat more equivocal and it should be
                            a major effort on our part to keep the Soviet Union from complete
                            solidarity with Hanoi and Peiping about Southeast Asia. I will discuss
                            orally the various contacts and possibilities as they shape up at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Reiteration of Policy</p>
                        <p>There is some danger that protracted periods of silence on our part can
                            lead to an impression either of indecision or of discouragement and
                            nervousness. Although the essential elements of our policy have been
                            stated many times, reiteration is necessary to remind public opinion
                            here and abroad of the essentials as we see them. I would consider these
                            essentials to be the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) The right of the nations of Southeast Asia to be left alone by their
                            neighbors to work out their own national life and their own
                            international policy without interference by others;</p>
                        <p>(2) The systematic and large-scale infiltration of trained personnel by
                            North Viet Nam into South Viet Nam contrary to the Geneva Agreements and
                            international law;</p>
                        <p>(3) The large scale and illegal infiltration of arms by North Viet Nam
                            into South Viet Nam;</p>
                        <p>(4) The absence of any US desire for a national military presence in
                            Southeast Asia, whether in the form of bases or in the form of the
                            continuing presence of American military personnel;</p>
                        <p>(5) Our commitment to the settlements of 1954 and 1962;</p>
                        <p>(6) The absence of any desire on our part to destroy by military means
                            the regimes in North Viet Nam or Mainland China;</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_359" n="359" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>(7) Our receptivity to political action which would achieve a result
                            consistent with these essential elements.<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">

                        <p rend="center">THE CURRENT POSITION OF HANOI AND PEIPING ON A NEGOTIATED
                            SETTLEMENT IN VIETNAM </p>
                        <p>1. According to press reports from Paris the Vietnamese Communists have
                            recently urged the French to step up their efforts aimed at arranging a
                            negotiated settlement of the war in South Vietnam. These accounts are
                            probably leaks of discussions between French officials and Asian
                            Communist representatives which began in December and continued on into
                            February. </p>
                        <p>2. Our only information concerning these talks is what the French have
                            chosen to tell us. This has been short on specifics and long on
                            speculation. We have seen nothing in Communist statements or in
                            Communist behavior which would support the contention that either Hanoi
                            or Peiping is interested in a conference solution except on its own
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>3. All indications are that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is no
                            more flexible now than it ever was in regard to a negotiated settlement.
                            On 10 February Hanoi specifically <pb xml:id="pg_360" n="360" facs="0392"/>reiterated its standard demands, stressing the two key
                            concepts on which the Communists have always insisted—the necessity for
                            withdrawal of US forces from South Vietnam and the initiation of
                            bilateral negotiations between the Communist Liberation Front (NLSV) and
                            the government in Saigon. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> officials,
                            moreover, have privately taken the same line in conversations with
                            Western diplomats in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s terms which have not changed
                            substantially since they were first put forward in 1963, include:</p>
                        <p>A. Withdrawal of US military personnel and equipment is a precondition
                            for any serious negotiations.</p>
                        <p>B. The South Vietnamese government must abide by the military provisions
                            of the Geneva agreements: refrain from any military alliances, permit no
                            foreign military bases or foreign military personnel in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>C. The South Vietnamese people must be permitted to settle their internal
                            affairs without outside interference in accordance with the program of
                            the Front. This is interpreted as the formulation of a coalition
                            government with Front participation.</p>
                        <p>D. Consultation must take place between the two zones looking toward
                            eventual reunification.</p>
                        <p>E. As of July 1964 Hanoi has included as a further condition an end to US
                            “provocations” against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>5. The recent activities of North Vietnamese agents in Paris suggest
                            Hanoi is seeking to stimulate French pressure for a US withdrawal as the
                            first step toward a negotiated settlement of the “impasse” in Indochina.
                            These maneuvers by the Communists appear designed mainly to encourage
                            opposition in France and elsewhere in the Free World to continued
                            prosecution of the war against the Viet Cong and to possible further US
                            attacks against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. Such motives were suggested by the North Vietnamese response to French
                            initiatives during the Paris conversations. Although there was no give
                            in the position taken by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            representative, he stressed an interest in continuing the discussions,
                            doubtless with a view to keeping French hopes for a negotiated
                            settlement alive. Similar objectives probably lie behind the recent
                            propaganda from Hanoi, which has reported without comment the substance
                            of French and Cambodian calls for a new international conference on
                            Indochina. There is, however, no evidence available to us that the North
                            Vietnamese are giving serious consideration to a conference.</p>
                        <p>7. The Chinese have consistently backed Hanoi's hard line concerning
                            negotiations and do not appear interested, at this time, even in the
                            kind of talks which might be exploited under some circumstances to give
                            Communist forces a breathing space.</p>
                        <p>8. The Chinese Communists are almost certainly optimistic concerning
                            developments in South Vietnam. The conversations initiated by <pb xml:id="pg_361" n="361" facs="0393"/>the Chinese in Paris were
                            apparently designed to obtain a better reading on these questions, and
                            at the same time to stimulate new French pressure on the US to withdraw
                            quietly from the “hopeless” impasse in Indochina. In this endeavor
                            Peiping is playing skillfully on French ambitions for a larger role in
                            Southeast Asia as mediators of the Sino-US conflict.</p>
                        <p>9. The remarks of the Chinese Charge in Paris, as reported by the French,
                            make it clear that Peiping—like Hanoi—has no desire for any agreement
                            except on Communist terms. The Chinese continue to insist that a
                            unilateral US withdrawal is the only basis for settlement.</p>
                        <p>10. Peiping's latest public statement on the question of possible
                            negotiations ridicules the idea of talks. A key paragraph of the
                            People's Daily editorial on 19 February claims that the US is hoping to
                            gain at the conference table what it cannot win on the battlefield and
                            then dismisses the notion as “too much wishful thinking.” The Chinese go
                            on to say that peace can be had in Vietnam at any time but only after
                            the “US aggressors have withdrawn” to permit the people in Vietnam to
                            “settle their own problems.”</p>

                                (Johnson Library, President's Daily Diary)</note> about our
                            psychological program in Viet Nam and the question of whether an outside
                            observer like Frank Stanton should have a look at it , I wish to cite a
                            few points that may help you to decide your next step.</p>
                        <p>1. First, let me say that we in the Agency would welcome a look at the
                            situation by Stanton. We believe that the program we have developed in
                            the last year is quite impressive—still, we welcome any fresh ideas as
                            to how we might better do the job.</p>
                        <p>2. Having said this, let me emphasize quickly that efforts to develop
                            among the South Vietnamese people a sense of national unity and a
                            determination to fight off Communist aggression, have not progressed to
                            my satisfaction. As you know so well, this kind of psychological
                            operation cannot be divorced from other problems there such as:</p>
                        <p>a. Shortcomings in the pacification program and the failure to give
                            lasting physical protection to the villagers we are urging to be
                            brave;</p>
                        <p>b. The continuing political turmoil that leaves us uncertain as to whom
                            we work with and the Vietnamese people confused as to who constitutes
                            the government we are asking them to rally 'round;</p>
                        <p>c. Or the widespread notion, voiced even by U.S. congressmen, that we are
                            waging a futile effort in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite these difficulties, we have made some psychological headway
                            during the past year, particularly in the Hop Tac areas. Given any
                            degree of political stability in the next year, and barring severe
                            military defeats for our side, I believe our projected program is such
                            that we can anticipate a further significant increase in unity and
                            will-to-win on the part of the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Nam Coordinating Committee has discussed thoroughly all the
                            areas where U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> programs might be
                            strengthened. It has decided that a working team, including a <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> representative, should go to Viet Nam
                            soon to effect whatever improvements are possible.</p>
                        <p>4. I mentioned to you Friday such things as my having almost doubled my
                            American staff and reallocated an extra million dollars to the Viet Nam
                            psychological program since I was there 10 months ago. <pb xml:id="pg_364" n="364" facs="0396"/>You may be interested in the

                        <p>Under the U.S. Mission Council in Viet Nam there is a Mission
                            Psychological Operations Committee which has representation from all
                            U.S. agencies in Viet Nam and is chaired by the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Country Public Affairs Officer, <persName corresp="#p_ZB1">Barry Zorthian</persName>. A country-wide
                            psychological operations committee has existed for some time in the
                            Vietnamese Government but has not functioned with full effectiveness due
                            to the continuing political turmoil. In some provinces, however, we have
                            built local structures for waging psychological warfare, and these can
                            now move ahead if there is a reasonable degree of political and military
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>Under the U.S. Psychological Operations Committee is a Joint Field

                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> employees are engaged in
                            producing such products as films, publications and leaflets designed for
                            Vietnamese rural audiences.</p>
                        <p>Also, 51 third-country personnel, including Filipinos, Chinese and
                            Australians, are engaged in operations closely related to the
                            aforementioned activities. Their work includes civic action, political
                            warfare and radio broadcasting.</p>
                        <p>One of the most significant developments in recent months has been the
                            formation of Provincial Psychological Operations Committees. Usually
                            chaired by the provincial governors themselves, these committees usually
                            have <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>), <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and, where
                            possible, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> representation.</p>
                        <p>5. Of course, numbers and statistics are not so important as the ideas
                            and their implementation. I am attaching for your perusal <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Saigon's field message no. 35 of
                            January 26, 1965,<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">Attached, but not

                            psychological effort. I have underlined some of the more important
                            points.</p>
                        <p>6. You asked me who in <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> might go
                            with Stanton to Viet Nam. I believe he should be accompanied by Jim Tull
                            of my staff. Tull is a real expert on Viet Nam who has inspected our
                            operation several times and knows well the strengths and weaknesses of
                            the psychological campaign.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, I weighed seriously your good and friendly advice and
                            decided to cancel the trip to Africa. Should you decide not to send
                            Stanton to Viet Nam, I think I should have another look at the situation
                            there myself. I believe I should spend a day at the Far East
                            ambassadorial conference (March 9), talking to our ambassadors about
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> programs and problems in such
                            places as Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, and Cambodia, and go on to Saigon
                            for a few days.</p>
                        <p>Please have me informed at your earliest convenience of your decision
                            regarding Stanton in order that we might assist him to the fullest
                            extent. No one believes more strongly than I that <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> must make a major contribution if we
                            are to succeed in this grim effort, and we do not want to miss any
                            opportunity.</p>

                        <p>At a press conference on February 24, U.N. Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> intimated that the U.S.
                            Government was hiding <pb xml:id="pg_366" n="366" facs="0398"/>from the

                                <persName>Rusk</persName> called the Secretary-General, apparently
                            at the latter's home, and said that “there had been quite a reaction in
                            Washington to the Secretary General's implication that the truth was
                            being withheld from the American people.” Among other things,
                                <persName>Rusk</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U
                                Thant</persName> that his proposals for talks with the North
                            Vietnamese had been “procedural” rather than “substantive.” A memorandum

                            could make a quiet but prompt call on the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and make the following points: 1) we have followed with
                            great interest all indications we have had from Hanoi and Peiping
                            through many channels in addition to their public broadcasts and we do
                            not yet see any indication on their side privately or otherwise that a
                            political <pb xml:id="pg_367" n="367" facs="0399"/>channel can be used
                            to bring about the security and safety and peace of these nations of
                            Southeast Asia; 2) any idea that the US should withdraw must be linked
                            with the cessation of infiltration from the North and a withdrawal of
                            infiltrated personnel that the North has sent in to South Viet Nam; this
                            is fundamental, otherwise it would leave the countries of Southeast Asia
                            at the mercy of the Communists; 3) there is no possibility of
                            negotiations the object of which is to have the US withdraw and leave
                            those countries to be overrun by the north; 4) a public negotiation
                            which fails is an exceedingly dangerous development in the situation;
                            therefore there is a real point in quiet diplomacy to ascertain whether
                            any possibility of success exists; 5) this is relevant to his calling a
                            meeting of the Powers in Geneva; it could be very dangerous if there is
                            not sufficient preparatory work; 6) we cannot undertake direct,
                            bilateral contact with Hanoi; we could not do it without the knowledge
                            of our friends in Southeast Asia; there was no indication such contacts
                            would produce results; we do not believe direct contact is desirable or
                            contributes to peace. <persName corresp="#p_Y1">Y</persName> said he
                            would ask what he could do. Sec said if he feels as <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> he wants to try to find out whether
                            Hanoi is prepared to accept the publicly stated American view that our
                            presence there is solely a result of the infiltration of men and
                            material from North to South Viet Nam and if this can be stopped,
                            American forces would go home—he could explore on his behalf but not on
                            ours. Sec said to emphasize very strongly that the idea of American
                            withdrawal in the absence of cessation of this aggression is out of the
                            question. <persName corresp="#p_Y1">Y</persName> will do that. Sec said
                            we were not looking for a face saver; we are looking for the security of
                            100 small nations around the world including his own of Burma; if he
                            feels as <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> by quiet diplomacy he can
                            find out something, ok. <persName corresp="#p_Y1">Y</persName> said he

                            basis and are pouching to you questions and proposals for your
                            consideration developed by interagency/group.</p>

                            too brief to permit full examination this problem although it was their
                            conclusion that pacification program requires strengthening,
                            particularly at margin between military action and civilian programs,
                            i.e. in strengthening and closely gearing together security actions,
                            civil affairs and civic action by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> on one hand and police,
                            provincial operations and economic and social programs by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and Ministries on the other. On basis
                            interagency study here we also concerned over gap in pacification
                            process following end of strictly military program and resumption
                            regular civil government. Study also brought out questions concerning
                            selection and training of pacification cadres; adequacy of Vietnamese
                            comprehension of pacification and supporting US programs and objectives;
                            need to assure prompt and flexible funding for province pacification
                            activities; need for maximum of initiative and decision at province
                            level to permit exploiting special opportunities (such as strong
                            province chiefs and secure areas) and adapting to non-typical
                            circumstances; taking full advantage special groups like students,
                            montagnards, religious organizations, labor; etc. You undoubtedly have
                            much longer list of questions and can probably also dispel what may be
                            our misconceptions of incomplete understanding within this highly
                            complicated and crucial field of activity. I feel we should periodically
                            assure we are moving in step.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind I would like your views on the desirability of my

                            with you on pacification program. To facilitate our discussion questions

                            if I were preceded by small interagency team to prepare ground for our

                            follow-up in each agency in Washington? Alternatively would you prefer
                            to defer visit such team and leave decision on this to be made during my

                            morning at which only <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bunche</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> were present, latter read full text of instructions
                            with occasional appropriate comment, particularly emphasizing points
                            made in paragraph one. Thereafter, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            launched into following lengthy explanation of his position.</p>
                        <p>He said he had been reading carefully and regularly since 1963 Hanoi
                            broadcasts as reported in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            publication. From these broadcasts he had become convinced that Hanoi
                            was ready to talk peace with US, that it was closer to Moscow than to
                            Peking, and that, indeed, though having to take account of geography, it
                            was clearly not pro-Peking.</p>
                        <p>His first piece of advice to US had been after <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> ouster when he had suggested to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> that US encourage
                            formation in South Vietnam of broad-based government which would include
                            certain Vietnamese leaders in exile, for the most part in Paris. He had
                            never had any reply to this suggestion and did not know whether US had
                            endeavored to follow it.</p>
                        <p>His second step had been taken last year when he had become convinced
                            that the situation was deteriorating seriously and that the longer it
                            deteriorated the more likely it was that the Communists would take over
                            South Vietnam. At that time the Hanoi radio was still indicating
                            willingness to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>He had asked Hanoi through the Soviets whether they would negotiate
                            directly and privately with US. To his surprise, Hanoi had promptly
                            replied in the affirmative. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had
                            communicated this fact to <pb xml:id="pg_370" n="370" facs="0402"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>, emphasizing his belief
                            that we should explore means of drawing Hanoi further away from Peking,
                            taking advantage in this respect of Moscow/Peking rift.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had subsequently
                            inquired at what place and at what level these contacts should occur, if
                            we should be disposed to pursue them. As to place, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had suggested various alternatives,
                            including Cambodia and Pakistan, but had recommended Rangoon, since both
                            US and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had diplomatic representation
                            there. He had sounded out the Burmese Govt as to whether it would offer
                            necessary facilities and <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> had replied
                            it would be happy to do so. This he had passed to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> in Dec.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d427">

                        <p>In January <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had resumed
                            conversation, pointing out great difficulty of US negotiating with
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> without <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> participating. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had
                            recognized cogency of this objection but had nevertheless felt that some
                            risks must be taken, that time is wasting and that Hanoi might change
                            its mind about negotiations at all. As alternative to bilateral
                            negotiation, and also to full-scale Geneva conference, they had
                            discussed possibility of meeting of five great powers plus two Vietnams.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> himself thought this was an
                            excellent idea and suggested Geneva as appropriate locus. He had,
                            however, had hitherto no reply from Washington to this suggestion, and
                            meanwhile, of course, Hanoi radio had become much more militant.<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">See <ref target="#d145">Document
                                145</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Subsequently, he had through Lord Caradon sent message to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> informing latter of his
                            suggestion of bilateral, and later of 5-plus-2 negotiations, and asking
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> to use his good offices in Washington to
                            bring about acceptance of this idea. He presumed
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> had raised problem in Washington though
                            he did not know in what form. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had
                            also discussed question of negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> during latter's recent visit.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> had advocated Geneva
                            conference with original composition but <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said this was impossible and mentioned 5-plus-2
                            proposal. To this <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> did not
                            comment. (Seydoux subsequently confirmed to <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had raised
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> suggestion of Geneva
                            conference with smaller participation.) <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> added that <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>
                            had expressed opinion that more than half of the population of South
                            Vietnam favors the Viet Cong. <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> contested this vigorously, expressing view that if
                            this were the case South Vietnam would long since have been taken
                            over.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> remarked that he had not
                            mentioned 5-plus-2 idea to Soviets, though they were of course aware of
                            his original idea of bilateral contacts since they had at his request
                            sounded out Hanoi.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_371" n="371" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> concluded his exposition by
                            emphasizing his continued conviction that, while it might already be too
                            late, it is still of utmost importance to find some means of coming to
                            negotiations, first of all because he believes that continuation and
                            escalation of armed conflict will force Moscow to rapprochement with
                            Peking, which would be greatest possible disaster, and second because of
                            his conviction that, on account of highly unstable political situation
                            in South Vietnam, continuance of war will inevitably end in total
                            Communist takeover.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> repeated
                            several salient points of our assessment of the situation, particularly
                            the fact that we have seen absolutely no sign that Hanoi and Peking are
                            prepared to negotiate in such a way as to take account of security and
                            interest of South Vietnam on the same basis as their own security and
                            interest, or that they have any conception of negotiations other than as
                            a means of facilitating total Communist takeover of South Vietnam. At
                            this point <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> suggested that US prepare
                            proposals or agenda for negotiation, for example, for 5-plus-2
                            conference, which might be submitted through appropriate intermediary to
                            Hanoi and which would smoke out basis on which they may be prepared to
                            negotiate. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said it would not be
                            appropriate for him to put forward any such proposals but implied he
                            would be willing to transmit them as coming from us.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> press conference,
                                <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> made several efforts to
                            determine what elements of “truth” <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> feels are being withheld from the American public.
                            It was obvious he was embarrassed and unhappy at the reaction which this
                            particular comment of his had provoked. He emphasized he had not meant
                            to accuse the US Govt of withholding info but had merely meant to bring
                            out that in a war situation many elements of truth are ignored or
                            forgotten, such as appeals of <persName corresp="#p_SLB1">Shastri</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Ayub</persName>, Ne
                            Win and others for negotiations, and such as markedly different way in
                            which Asians and Americans regard many of the questions at issue in this
                            conflict. In other words, it appeared that what he had had in mind was
                            not that facts and background are being withheld from the US public but
                            simply that factors which he considers of utmost importance tend to be
                            swamped and obscured in the volume of day-to-day war news. He admitted
                            that the only “fact” which had not been revealed was Hanoi's private
                            indication to him of its willingness to negotiate bilaterally with US,
                            and that this was largely procedural point since everyone has been aware
                            of their desire for a Geneva conference (without the slightest
                            indication in either case that they are prepared to negotiate
                            even-handed settlement). <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> was relaxed
                            and cordial throughout conversation, obviously firmly attached to basic
                            conceptions on these issues which he has had for many years, but still
                            distressed and embarrassed that what he had said, particularly in regard
                            to “facts” and “truth”, had given rise to such deep concern in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_372" n="372" facs="0404"/>
                        <p>It would appear that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> considers he has
                            had provisional response to various suggestions he has been making to US
                            in recent months. However, he obviously expects US to continue to
                            consider urgently desirability of early negotiations in one form or
                            another and to hope he may be of service in this connection. The only
                            concrete point on which he might expect some early comment would be
                            whether or not we saw any merit in his idea that we should smoke out
                            Hanoi's intentions by suggesting through him or another intermediary our
                            idea of agenda of meeting in case it should eventually take place.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, at <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> luncheon, <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bunche</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> that he and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had
                            discussed the matter further after <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>'s departure and had come to the tentative
                            conclusion that it would be desirable to issue to the press this
                            afternoon clarification of those of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s remarks which had caused most concern in Washington.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> said he thought this
                            would be most helpful and further indicated to <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bunche</persName> his personal view that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s ill-considered public comments on
                            Vietnam risk undermining his and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s
                            possible usefulness in later stages of this problem. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Bunche</persName> fully agreed. He later drafted
                            press clarification for <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and accepted
                            several modifications which <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>

                            <item>Discussion with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, Thursday evening, from 6:15 p.m. for about

                        </list>
                        <p>1. I handed President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and
                            briefly discussed the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Memorandum dated February 25th concerning attitude of Hanoi and
                            Peiping towards negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Apparently a
                                reference to <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> I stated
                            our opinion was that <pb xml:id="pg_373" n="373" facs="0405"/>both
                            Communist China and <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would, under
                            current circumstances and conditions, enter negotiations only on their
                            terms. Moscow on the other hand seemed to have a more lenient approach,
                            as reported by the French, largely through the press.</p>
                        <p>b. Watch Report of February 25th<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">Not
                                found.</note> pointing out the numbered paragraphs concerning
                            indications of Communist movements southward in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, movement in Laos, high level of communications, and
                            other indicators. I stated there was a high probability that the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, were assembling sufficient military strength to cut off
                            the four Northern provinces of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. I
                            stated that in June of 1962 <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and Nhu told me that this was an objective of Hanoi, and for that reason
                            they maintained large forces in the Northern provinces. However, these
                            forces had since been removed because of deterioration in the Delta and
                            other areas of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The President agreed
                            that this seemed to be the objective of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. Report of February 25th<note n="3" target="d165fn3">Not found.</note>
                            giving the background of military and political characters remaining in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and the status of the various
                            religious sects, political groups, etc. I mentioned considerable
                            suspicion and distrust in Generals <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, noting
                            that the former participated in the 1960 coup, fled to Phnom Penh, lived
                            there for three years in close consultation with neutralists and
                            possibly unfriendly forces and, as Commander of the 1st Corps, he was in
                            a most strategic position to collaborate with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> in establishing
                            an independent country composed of the four Northern provinces.</p>
                        <p>2. The President asked if Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was fully aware of all of this and I responded
                            that in all probability he was, but I questioned whether he held
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> in the same suspicion as did I. He
                            then said that it was too bad that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> could not “have his own man” running the
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Action: I would like consideration of a summary of all of the above
                            transmitted to Saigon station with instructions to discuss with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>,
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> and the Country Team. Also, I wish to
                            call attention of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> to all of the above.</p>
                        <p>3. Prior to this meeting I met privately with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> who was waiting to see the
                                President<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">

                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Henry Cabot
                                Lodge</persName> to come in to see him on Friday (for press reasons,

                            see the President).<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> met with the President
                                from 12:30 to 1:15 p.m. on Friday, February 26. (Ibid., President's
                                Daily Diary) In a February 25 memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> had been an “advocate of our
                                policy in Vietnam,” supporting it recently in a speech in Miami and
                                in interviews in <hi rend="italic">U.S. News &amp; World

                        </p>
                        <p>During the conversation the President called me, and in <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s presence he said that he wanted
                            the proper officials to review with <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> everything on Vietnam. The President said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>, as a friend and as a
                            former public servant with experience in Vietnam, might have some useful
                            ideas for us to follow up. He suggested that <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> review the current situation with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>, and that <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> also see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, and probably General <persName corresp="#p_GLGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> in Defense. The President
                            said that we should consider him as a Consultant.</p>
                        <p>I talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> and
                            we have made the following arrangements. We will call him a Presidential
                            Consultant and will pay transportation, per diem, and our maximum WAE of
                            $75 per day. He will return to Washington Monday afternoon (March 1). We
                            will put him in Bob Komer's office so he will have a base of operations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Chet Cooper</persName> will lay out his
                            appointments.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s view of his
                            role is that of a person with some experience in Vietnam who, after
                            having read himself into the current situation, might prepare a paper
                            containing his conclusions and recommendations. This paper, if he
                            decides to write one, would conclude his immediate assignment, probably
                            the same week it begins.</p>
                        <p>The State Department is anxious to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> hold General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s hand during the time
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is in the U.S.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>, an old friend, is
                            anxious to do this and is prepared to have <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> visit him in Massachusetts for a weekend. He would
                            be quite prepared to do whatever we think would be useful in connection
                            with keeping General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> out
                            of trouble during the time he is in the United States.</p>

                        <p>2767. For <persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador. <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1">Deptel</gloss> 1820.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">
                                <ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> Will be glad to have
                            you visit Saigon at any time, however, we do not feel the need of an
                            interagency team or of an extensive restudy of the theory and practice
                            of pacification at this time. Most of the defects in the pacification
                            program are the result of inadequate security and ineffective
                                government,<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">See <ref target="#d172">Document 172</ref>.</note> and not through a lack of
                            understanding of the requirements of pacification. In other words, our
                            main problem is not theory but execution. All hands here are hard at
                            work trying to get the Quat government in motion and must put first
                            things first in priority of attention. We expect progressively to review
                            and improve methods and procedures of pacification with the new
                            government, bearing in mind the need to avoid interference with on-going
                            programs. We will keep you informed as to our thoughts in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>In meantime we would be glad to see you here before or after Baguio but I
                            believe you will find your visit here more profitable if you have a look
                            at the entire spectrum of our principal problems.</p>

                            consultations.</p>
                        <p>You should consult urgently with Quat, describing proposed deployment and
                            its purposes, and seek his approval and ascertain whether he sees any
                            serious problem. If Quat approves, believe we should also have full
                            understanding and acceptance of Minister of Defense, Chief of Staff, and
                            perhaps most important <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> as
                            Corps commander. All should clearly understand mission, and arrangements
                            with military and particularly <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> should clearly provide for cooperation with local
                            military, leaving them in no doubt this is deployment for a limited
                            purpose and that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must continue have
                            full responsibility in pacification program.</p>
                        <p>Since, assuming <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concurrence all
                            levels, this will be first US ground deployment of such a unit, request
                            your recommendation as to timing of deployment and form of announcement.
                            Reference to general security duties seems to us best approach, since we
                            do not wish on one hand to give impression pacification mission or on
                            other hand to indicate we alarmed over DaNang security.</p>
                        <p>We are considering further recommendations for Composite Marine Air
                            Group, third <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>, and remaining elements

                            Thuan) which is heavily weighted in favor of Centrists, northerners and
                            Buddhists, and is unanimous in its “anti-Diemism.” As far as we can
                            determine, this group coalesced last fall in effort to form lay Buddhist
                            party which would seek to use the influence wielded by Buddhist
                            Institute leadership and Buddhist mass as political base, but would
                            enable that leadership to stay out of direct political activity. This
                            group through Thuan and Bui Tuong Huan—had support of <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName>, and appears to have remained
                            entirely separate from group of civilians around <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName>; Thuan and Huan were in fact
                            furious with <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName> for having
                            embroiled Buddhist Institute in confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> government. From all we can
                            gather, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s group has over
                            past several months remained cohesive, despite differing religious,
                            regional and political backgrounds. Group is made up of intelligent,
                            educated, articulate, imaginative men. One might even say that group
                            represents first nucleus of political entity in post-<persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> South Vietnam to emerge out of
                            country's present political turmoil and needs and not held together (or
                            divided) by issues of past eras.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_378" n="378" facs="0410"/>
                        <p>Now that group is in power it faces its biggest test: Will it be able to
                            provide dynamic leadership and remain together in face of monumental
                            problems and pressures which confront it? Odds in its favor are not
                            good.</p>
                        <p>While membership of new government and of dominant clique within it
                            compares favorably with any other group in sight, it has had little
                            chance to date to demonstrate its abilities having been faced with a
                            coup attempt shortly after investiture. Its ability to exercise
                            leadership in facing problems of war effort will depend in large measure
                            on its success in relieving pressures of contending political power
                            factors, most important of which are <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss>, Catholics, and military. Each of these elements has power
                            at the very least to generate pressures which would force <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to devote self to putting out brush
                            fires and prevent <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from achieving
                            record of accomplishment which will be vital to its retention of
                            political control.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> starts with support
                            of <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss>'s dominant faction, Centrist
                            group led by <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Thien Minh</persName>, and in fact
                            represents government which this element has apparently wanted. Remains
                            true, on other hand, that <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> leadership
                            has never yet supported any government for very long; furthermore, we
                            suspect that <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> probably
                            feels that he has gotten little satisfaction in make-up of cabinet. Only
                            man that can be identified with <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName> is Minister of Chieu Hoi Tran Van An (<persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s efforts for An may indicate
                            that old <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> alliance retained force,
                            supposition which receives support from rumor that <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName> met in Phu Yen on February 20 during failing hours
                            of coup attempt). <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s exile
                            may accentuate <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName>'s unhappiness,
                            since it deprives him of one more source of strength.</p>
                        <p>However, it is not clear that <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Chau</persName>
                            is in much of position to act against new <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, if government retains support of
                                <persName>Quang</persName> faction. In any case, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has taken steps to satisfy some <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> desires. Buddhist bete noire Tran Thanh
                            Ben has been replaced as director of national police, and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has announced release of all
                            individuals who had been arrested for participation in anti-<persName corresp="#p_HUONG1">Huong</persName> demonstrations. Current
                            question on <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> policy therefore is
                            whether they will press other demands (e.g. replacement of Capital
                            Military District [Commander] <persName>Pham Van Dong</persName>,
                            closure of newspapers which had taken line hostile to them, withdrawal
                            of license of rival general Buddhist association) and whether they
                            intend proceed to develop “peace” campaign.</p>
                        <p>On Catholic side, there has been apprehension of growing <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> influence. Militant northern refugees
                            suspect <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> of being in <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss>'s pocket, and these fears are being fed
                            by concessions already made and would be accentuated by further
                            concessions. Furthermore, many Catholics fear themselves compromised by
                            February 19 coup manque leadership of which was heavily Catholic and
                            which indicated nostalgia for <pb xml:id="pg_379" n="379" facs="0411"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime thus giving new
                            impetus to fears that Catholics will suffer from Buddhist reaction. Most
                            important, should Buddhists push “peace” theme, Catholic fears that
                            Communist take-over being facilitated might well become extreme. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has shown awareness of importance of
                            quieting Catholic fears that government may be hostile to them, but
                            possibility remains real that if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            shows self too solicitous toward Buddhists, or if <gloss target="#t_UBA1">UBA</gloss> continues to mount political pressures,
                            Catholics may go over into opposition.</p>
                        <p>Final major element in position to create great political problems for
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is military. Removal from scene
                            of General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has eliminated
                            one major source of instability, but other candidates for this role
                            remain within <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss>. Despite protestations
                            of a desire to return to fighting the war, we can expect further
                            political turbulence from this quarter. <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> is still clearly prime mover of government structure
                            today (despite <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss>'s retention of
                            provisional charter), and has direct representation both in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VIEN1">Vien</persName> and
                            Hong) and in new legislative council. <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> appointed <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> as
                            Chief of State and (contrary to charter) named <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> as Prime Minister. Before
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s government was
                            officially announced, <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> had issued
                            policy declaration (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                                2620).<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">Dated February 16. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Moreover, that declaration stated clearly that <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> had watchdog role over government until latter could be
                            based on popular choice. Seems clear that <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government will be plagued by <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> looking over its shoulder and <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> group could even be discredited
                            individually and collectively as puppets of military. Although in wake
                            February 19 coup attempt <gloss target="#t_AFC1">AFC</gloss> has
                            reaffirmed its support for <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> primacy its position
                            remains unimpaired.</p>
                        <p>On positive side of ledger, increased direct role of US air power in
                            struggle will give both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            population as whole psychological lift which will both provide momentum
                            for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to mount program and may also
                            serve to damp down factional pressures.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            government has potential, whether it will live up to that potential or
                            not cannot yet be judged. It appears to have ridden out successfully its
                            first storm, thanks largely to fact that coup plotters were widely
                            unpopular within military establishment.</p>

                            were taken:</p>
                        <p>A. Phased deployment ashore at Da Nang of two <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss>'s and a helicopter squadron of 9th <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss> was approved. Deployment of 3d <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss> and remainder of command and support
                            elements (including fixed-wing aircraft component) was deferred for
                            future decision.</p>
                        <p>B. Medium level photo recce of the southern part of North Vietnam in
                            conjunction with Rolling Thunder IV was approved. Separate Blue Tree
                            message refers.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>C. Recognizing that Rolling Thunder probably could not be executed on 27
                            February for weather reasons, execution on 28 February or as soon
                            thereafter as weather permits was favorably considered. You will, of
                            course, be advised by separate messages of strike approvals.</p>
                        <p>2. It was made clear that U.S. policy is as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_Do1">Do</persName> everything possible to
                            maximize our military efforts to reverse present unfavorable
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>B. In accordance with A. above, increase substantially our military
                            efforts in South Vietnam. More on this in subsequent paragraphs.
                            Increase tempo and effectiveness of our strikes against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> being careful to avoid pushing them to
                            the extent of forcing ChiCom intervention.</p>
                        <p>C. In view of lack of interest exhibited by Hanoi and Peking in
                            negotiations at this time and the weakness of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/U.S. position at the Council table,
                            refrain from early negotiations. In this connection it was recognized
                            that the preliminaries to any realistic negotiations would require at
                            least three to six months to produce results, making it even more
                            necessary for us to take positive action to reverse the unfavorable
                            situation in South Vietnam by all means available.</p>
                        <p>3. On the military side, the following items were discussed in an
                            exploratory way centering about the desire to determine what military
                            actions can be increased or what new actions can be taken to improve the
                            over-all situation.</p>
                        <p>A. Provision of additional U.S. advisors at the fighting unit level.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_381" n="381" facs="0413"/>
                        <p>B. Measures to improve intelligence so that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> installations and concentrations can be detected and
                            struck from the air.</p>
                        <p>C. Provision of more helicopters for both surveillance and fire
                            support.</p>
                        <p>D. Increased use of U.S. jet aircraft in South Vietnam to support the
                            conterinsurgency effort. In this connection, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>'s recommendations<note n="4" xml:id="d170fn4">Not further identified.</note> are being
                            processed by the Joint Staff.</p>
                        <p>E. Increased use of light observation type aircraft, perhaps with a photo
                            capability, to find <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> targets.</p>
                        <p>F. U.S. naval augmentation of efforts of Vietnamese Navy to prevent
                            infiltration of material from the sea. In this connection, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s present proposals and
                            actions4 were noted. In addition, the idea was advanced that low-level
                            helicopter reconnaissance patrols along selected <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> dominated coastal areas might be used effectively to
                            augment surface patrol and fixed-wing air patrol.</p>
                        <p>G. Note was taken of actual and prospective removal of military
                            commanders and province and district chiefs by <persName corresp="#p_MLM1">Little Minh</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, and Thi. There was concern that these actions
                            represent continuing and dangerous friction in the higher military
                            levels and that this attitude plus the removals themselves, will further
                            weaken the already fragile military and government control.</p>
                        <p>4. The entire conference reflected determination to press forward despite
                            difficulties to achieve the limited objectives set by the U.S. in
                            Southeast Asia. At the same time, there was evident concern that we are
                            not doing enough to achieve these objectives. All present were invited
                            to present ideas in their respective fields which will enhance our
                            efforts. In turn, addressees are requested to comment as they desire on
                            the above items and to put forward other ideas.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of the sensitivity of certain portions of this message,
                            request that it be handled on a close-hold basis.</p>

                        <p>On February 27 the Department of State released a report entitled

                            appendixes and was divided into six sections:</p>

                        <p>I. Hanoi Supplies the Key Personnel for the Armed Aggression Against

                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The report, without the pictures and appendixes, was also printed in the
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 22, 1965,
                            pages 404–427. Also on February 27, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai E. Stevenson</persName> transmitted a copy
                            of the report to the President of the U.N. Security Council for the
                            information of the Council's members. The text of his covering letter to
                            the Council's President is ibid., page 419.</p>
                        <p>The report was a sequel to “A Threat to the Peace: North Viet-Nam's
                            Effort to Conquer South Viet-Nam,” released by the Department of State
                            on December 8, 1961, whose preparation was coordinated by William
                            Jorden, of the Department of State's Policy Planning Council. In its
                            early stages of preparation in 1964, “Aggression from the North” was
                            sometimes referred to as the Jorden Report, but in its final stages,

                        <p>Enclosed is a study describing some attitudes and views of the rural
                            population of Viet Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Attached, but not
                                printed. The study was entitled “Facts and Attitudes: <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> An Province” (R-10–65), and
                                was issued by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in February
                                1965.</note> The information is based on a series of interviews
                            obtained by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> field personnel in
                                <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> An Province, an area
                            thirty miles south of Saigon.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">The interviews
                                were conducted during the first seven months of 1964. For an account
                                by one of the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> officers

                                a Vietnamese Province.</note> The province is typical of much of
                            rural Viet Nam in that large portions of the province are under Viet
                            Cong control, militarily and politically.</p>

                        <p>The conclusions drawn from the study are not startlingly new and are what
                            we have long suspected—that the principal problems facing us in
                            obtaining the support of the Vietnamese population are inadequate
                            security and ineffective Government. The report, however, is the first
                            of which I am aware, which places into such sharp clarity the key
                            aspects of the overall problem.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> researchers conclude that the
                            population is largely apathetic and is primarily interested in ending
                            the twenty years of war; they care less as to which side will win,
                            although there appears to be a substantial degree of approval of the
                            Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Insecurity from Viet Cong harassment represents the principal obstacle to
                            changing the apathy to active support of the Saigon Government. In
                            addition, the rural population desires evidence that the Government
                            intends to carry out realistic development programs, and has the staff
                            to direct these programs with honesty and efficiency.</p>
                        <p>In the eyes of the average rural Vietnamese, Saigon neither knows nor
                            cares about his needs and desires.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, the Viet Cong has exacerbated these shortcomings of the
                            Saigon Government through potent military insurgency, sabotage of
                            governmental development programs, and terror and assassination directed
                            against the better and more energetic local Government officials.
                            Despite these tactics, the Viet Cong's rural presence has been
                            characterized by a careful regard for the peasant's attitude.</p>

                        <p>2. I have heard it said that you'll be off and running at the crack of
                            dawn. I hope not. What is needed now is more walking and less running.
                            Perhaps a bit of just plain sitting would be useful. I'll come back to
                            this theme later but let me, first, bring you up to date.</p>
                        <p>3. On the Political front:</p>
                        <p>a. The Government seems to be settling down after the <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> affair. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> seems to be more sure-footed than
                            his predecessor. Relations (at least as they come through the cables)
                            between the Embassy and the Government seem to be less subjective, more
                            businesslike. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s statement
                            that the “war must end”<note n="3" xml:id="d173fn3">At the ceremony on
                                February 25 at which General <persName corresp="#p_NK1">Nguyen
                                    Khanh</persName> turned over command of the Vietnamese armed
                                forces to General <persName corresp="#p_TVMLM1">Tran Van
                                    Minh</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> was quoted as saying that South Vietnam was
                                “suffering too much” and “we want to end the war with honor.”</note>
                            (quoted out of context by the press) aroused some worry here, but
                            subsequent words and actions indicate determination to press ahead on
                            all fronts.</p>
                        <p>b. The Buddhists, while giving at least tacit support to the Government,
                            are causing troubles by unhelpful statements on the part of key
                            venerables in favor of negotiations and U.S. withdrawal (it is not
                            always clear which they want first). A “peace” group, with active
                            Buddhist support if not sponsorship, has been active in Saigon as well
                            as in the Northern provinces.</p>
                        <p>c. The Catholics are worried about increasing Buddhist influence and,
                            while behaving themselves thus far, may stir things up.</p>
                        <p>d. The generals (especially <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> and now-discredited Adm.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CANG1">Cang</persName>) have by no means
                            settled down to business. Although they make the proper noises, there is
                            enough behind-the-scene activity to indicate that we have by no means
                            seen the end of their maneuvering.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_385" n="385" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>4. On the Negotiations front:</p>
                        <p>a. There were some traumatic hours last week as a result of <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>'s press statements<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">See <ref target="#d161">Documents 161</ref>, <ref target="#d162">162</ref>, and <ref target="#d164">164</ref>.</note> (he tabled “proposals”, the American people were
                            not getting the “truth”, he had assurances that Hanoi was “willing to
                            talk”). This has calmed down now, but I fear it has badly damaged
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>'s relations with the
                            President and <persName>Rusk</persName> and that it forced us to talk
                            more and more deprecatingly about negotiations than we may have
                            wished.</p>
                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Soviet contacts seem to be on
                            dead-center, but apparently still have some life.</p>
                        <p>c. The French-Soviet conversations appear to have stalled on the issue of
                            preconditions (the Soviets want the U.S. to call off bombing the North
                            prior to a conference). There are signs that France wants to press its
                            role as Negotiators-in-Chief, willy-nilly.</p>
                        <p>d. <persName>Rusk</persName>'s press conference<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">See <ref target="#d157fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    157</ref>.</note> went off very well and his repeated reference
                            to the lack of any indication that the Communists are willing to engage
                            in any meaningful talk—“the missing piece” made a wholesome impact in
                            the press.</p>
                        <p>5. On the Communist front:</p>

                            tough, but measured and not excessively shrill. New element was that we
                            should get out of South Korea as well as Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>b. Peiping has been its usually unpleasant self, but nothing momentous to
                            note since the last outburst (made before you left) that we have
                            “erased” the 17th parallel as a demarcation line.</p>
                        <p>c. Hanoi has generally been shrill, arrogant, and blustering, but has
                            said nothing so unusual as to send analysts back to their drawing
                            boards.</p>
                        <p>d. There has been no discernible hint out of any of these capitals that
                            would lead even an optimist to feel that “meaningful” talks are in
                            sight.</p>
                        <p>e. Neither <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s trip nor any
                            other development seems to have done anything to repair Sino-Soviet
                            relations. Rather the reverse.</p>
                        <p>6. On the Pacification front:</p>
                        <p>a. Nothing good to report. The situation on the ground in Vietnam is
                            slipping. Nothing new since you left—just more of the same.</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has asked that we not
                            send a working-level team from here to look into the situation (“not

                            Have pressed for careful examination by <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> 's Committee of all ideas, no matter how
                            superficially kooky they might initially appear. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has appointed Bright Boy

                        <p>7. On South Vietnam Military front:</p>
                        <p>a. Decision re Marines at Da Nang involves immediate deployment of one
                            battalion for airport security, and remainder of Brigade in increments
                            in due course. This story leaked out of Saigon today.</p>
                        <p>b. Much activity by U.S. bombers against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations. Damage (i.e., <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties) may well be considerable, but reliable
                            read-out is lacking. The only thing we know has happened is that we
                            knocked out an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> regimental command
                            post.</p>
                        <p>c. No major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> victories. Incidents at about average level, mostly
                            ambushes and miscellaneous atrocities.</p>
                        <p>d. Largest chopper operation of the war (about 170) netted nothing.</p>
                        <p>8. On <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> Military front:</p>

                        <p>10. The Home front:</p>
                        <p>a. So much for where we stand. The real question, though, is where are we
                            going? We are in a new phase of the war, both as regards the North
                            (Rolling Thunder) and the South (U.S. bombing of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations). The hope is that we will bang sense (or
                            fear) into Hanoi, and will significantly damage <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capabilities in the South. So far so good. But suppose
                            neither happens at present levels of activity? <persName corresp="#p_Do1">Do</persName> we step them up, or turn them off?
                            Presumably, the former. But there are three factors emerging within
                            South Vietnam that should be ground into the calculations. All of them
                            have been alluded to in earlier paragraphs: The fragile relationship
                            among the generals, the “peace movement”, the faltering pacification
                            program.</p>
                        <p>b. I am aware that we all agreed that our requirements for a central
                            government should be very modest, but this was on the assumption that we
                            had a military chain of command. What might emerge is an acceptable
                            government, but discord among the military. This cannot be shrugged off.
                            One of the Rolling Thunders was cancelled last week because the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> had not recovered from the aftermath
                            of the coup.</p>
                        <p>c. The “peace movement” at the moment appears to be relatively
                            insignificant. But I am not confident that it will remain so. The
                            Buddhist bonzes have been making strange noises lately and are in a
                            position, in the light of their following and the general war weariness,
                            to give it a good shove.</p>
                        <p>d. Unless we can get cracking fast (i.e., tomorrow), on reversing the
                            trend in the pacification program, our air activity will have bought us
                            considerable risks, but not much else. And I am a little worried that
                            much of our energies here in Washington (and I suspect in Saigon as
                            well) are absorbed in targeting, scheduling, and press releases, rather
                            than the grubby business of clearing and holding.</p>
                        <p>e. This lugubrious rack-up could add up to a situation where the pressure
                            for negotiations has expanded—internationally (perhaps not very
                            important), in the U.S. (important, but not critical), and in South
                            Vietnam (critical). Meanwhile we haven't gained much purchase for our
                            troubles.</p>
                        <p>11. Every military plan has (or is supposed to have) an alternative in
                            the event matters do not proceed as planned. For some reason, it is
                            regarded as treasonable, defeatist—or at least chicken-hearted—to do the
                            same kind of “what if—?” planning in the case of a political scenario.
                                <pb xml:id="pg_388" n="388" facs="0420"/>But we have a great stake
                            in our present Vietnam policy (greater than ever before). And for our
                            policy to come off we must rely on several factors over which we have
                            little or no direct control. We cannot simply assume things will go as
                            we plan or hope. We should have some alternative course in mind, in the
                            event that the march of events does not proceed according to our plans
                            and desires. Obviously, there are many imponderables, and it would be
                            footless [foolish] to try to out-guess chance or fate. But, and this is
                            my plea, an effort should be undertaken to develop options as we proceed
                            down our present path. Such an effort will not be exerted unless it is
                            ordered on a priority basis by high authority. I know; I've tried. Key
                            people are too absorbed by today's flaps to have time for tomorrow's
                            problems.</p>

Reference MAC 1061.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">In MAC 1061, March 1, addressed to <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> raised several

                                    recognize the policy and procedural difficulties imposed upon
                                    you, your staff, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and

                                    Rolling Thunder exercised by Washington. Hence, I will not
                                    address the several points which you logically raise. Let me
                                    assure you that we here, both the Secretary of Defense and the
                                        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, are doing our utmost to

                                    sizable and vexing domestic and international political problems
                                    inherent in our military operations against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Washington authorities are
                                    attempting to steer a careful course which maximizes the effect
                                        <pb xml:id="pg_389" n="389" facs="0421"/>of our operations
                                    both inside and outside South Vietnam, while minimizing the
                                    chance of suddenly escalating military action to the point where
                                    the ChiComs would become involved. Setting aside the weather
                                    problem, the recent visit of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to Hanoi and the Communist conference
                                    now underway in Moscow have contributed to the political
                                    problems being faced here and have had an impact upon
                                    contemplated military action.</p>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. You may ask what does the future hold? Recall that Yankee Team and
                            Barrel Roll missions were subject to the same type of restrictions when
                            these operations were first initiated. Over a period of time,
                            restrictions here have been relaxed as people became used to the idea of
                            conducting recce and making strikes in Laos. We are working toward
                            setting up some such similar procedure for Rolling Thunder; i.e.,
                            agreeing upon a bank of targets to be struck by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> and U.S. forces at times to be selected by field
                            commanders in accordance with the weather and other operational factors.
                            In this connection, it is most important to get off this next Rolling
                            Thunder to break what seems to be a psychological/political log jam.</p>

                        <p>2817. For the President. There was a perceptible feeling of relief in
                            Saigon when General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            finally left town last Thursday.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">February
                                25.</note> However, up until the time he was airborne, there were
                            many who felt he would make some last dramatic effort to regain his lost
                            power. I would not write him off now because he is certain to return to
                            local scene at some time in the future, probably choosing a moment of
                            particular awkwardness for the government in being at the time.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s departure does not end
                            the problems in the officer corps where there are many seeds for future
                            trouble. General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> is already
                            maneuvering for <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>'s
                            position of military strongman, utilizing his apparently solid political
                            and military base as I Corps Commander in the Hue-Danang area. He is not
                            as clever as <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> but may be
                            able to compete with him as a troublemaker. Fortunately, his ambitions
                            are apparent to most of his military colleagues who have their guard
                            up.</p>
                        <p>A noteworthy development in the political field has been the upsurge in
                            “peace” talks. Several Buddhist Institute leaders, including <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TC1">Tam Chau</persName> as well as secondary leaders, <persName corresp="#p_HG1">Ho Giac</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName>, have been publicly quoted in vague and fuzzy
                            statements as favoring an end to the war and the withdrawal of foreign
                            forces. (<persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri Quang</persName> recently told
                            an Embassy officer close to him that he had been misquoted and explained
                            his views in a way which sounded very close to U.S. policy in South
                                Vietnam.)<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">This conversation was
                                described in telegram 2808 from Saigon, March 2. (Department of

                                S)</note> Concurrently, there has been a flurry of “peace”
                            propaganda calculated by groups, some of which have been heard from for
                            the first time. According to the police, some of these groups are
                            Communist front organizations; others apparently are simply parroting
                            Viet Cong propaganda. It is too early to tell what all this amounts to
                            or whether the Buddhist Institute is preparing a new campaign to plague
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government and to press
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> into negotiations. The
                            greatest significance discernible for the moment in the flurry of
                            “peace” propaganda is the fact that it has occurred openly in Saigon,
                            rather than in the intrinsic strength of the organizations involved. In
                            any case, in his press conference yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> attempted to put “peace” talk,
                            whether of external or internal origin, into perspective. He pointed out
                            that South Vietnam was defending itself against external aggression, <pb xml:id="pg_394" n="394" facs="0426"/>that true peace for South
                            Vietnam required an end to this aggression and effective guarantees, and
                            that the Vietnamese Government rejects any international solution which
                            has not received the agreement of that government and of the Vietnamese
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong activity was up somewhat and caused further deterioration in
                            the security situation in the northern portion of II Corps where there
                            are strong indications of the presence of new Viet Cong main force
                            units. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> 's
                            headquarters is continuously reviewing the available intelligence and
                            will probably raise the estimated in country Viet Cong main force
                            strength now at 34,000 to something over 40,000. One consequence of this
                            increased Viet Cong strength in II Corps has been to drive nearly 56,000
                            people into refugee centers in Binh Dinh province, thereby developing an
                            acute refugee problem.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have recently made two important departures from former
                            policy in authorizing the use of U.S. aircraft under certain conditions
                            to strike Viet Cong targets in South Vietnam and in deciding to
                            introduce Marine combat units for the defense of the Danang airfield.
                            While I accept the justification for these actions, I am concerned that
                            we not rush in and take over the conduct of the war from the Vietnamese.
                            I think that it would be a political and psychological mistake to change
                            our past position that this is a Vietnamese war in which we are helping
                            in areas where the Vietnamese cannot help themselves. While increased
                            involvement of the U.S. directly in the war in South Vietnam along with
                            the strikes against the North will tend to solve some immediate problems
                            arising from eroding morale and from the shortage of available
                            Vietnamese forces, in the long run we will have the problem of avoiding
                            any sense of the part of the Vietnamese that they thus have less
                            responsibility for maximizing their own war effort.</p>

                            Nevertheless, as set forth in reference and in other messages over the
                            past several months, there is growing concern here that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> inroads—territory-wise, population-wise,
                            and psychological—are in fact destroying the fabric of SouthVietnam.
                            Those at highest level here wonder whether this erosion is reaching the

                            define in advance what the nature of these indications must be in order
                            to persuade us that Hanoi is serious and to move us from our present
                            position that “the essential element”, i.e. their interest in a
                            resolution, is still missing. Nevertheless we should at this time
                            prepare for that moment by defining our own position on conditions. We
                            must also determine the extent to which those conditions—i.e. the
                            corrective actions which must be taken by North Viet-Nam—are to be posed
                            by us as preconditions which must be fulfilled before we would be ready
                            even to talk, directly or through intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed for purposes of this paper that the Communist demands will
                            be first for a cessation of US-<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> air
                            attacks against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>; they may pose this
                            as a precondition for any kind of talks. They will also press for the
                            withdrawal of U.S. military forces from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, if not all, then all but a small advisory group, and
                            for an end to U.S. arms supply to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            They may well also pose as conditions the neutralization and
                            non-alignment of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, its pledge not to
                            call on <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> for help, and
                            conceivably the inclusion in the Government of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> of representation from the Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that our price for a cessation of air attacks be a
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> support of the Viet
                            Cong in men and materiel. This should not be a matter of preconditions
                            to talks since it will require talks to work out the manner in which we,
                            the U.S., can be satisfied that such support by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> has ceased. Until we are satisfied, we should not agree
                            to call off the air attacks since once suspended in an atmosphere of
                            anticipated détente it would be very difficult to resume them.</p>
                        <p>It will not be an easy matter to decide whether or not <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> has in fact stopped the flow of men and
                            materiel from north to south. Probably the most practicable way to
                            achieve this would be to charge the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>s
                            both in Laos and in Viet-Nam with carrying on a surveillance over the
                            land and sea infiltration routes and the supply depots and training
                            camps in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> where the infiltration has
                            its origin. In this process there is one key indicator of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> intentions: the willingness to instruct
                            the Pathet Lao to permit free <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            circulation and investigation in the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-controlled areas in Laos. If this permission, which it has
                            been impossible for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to secure
                            since the Geneva Accords were signed in 1962, were to be granted it
                            would give reason to believe that <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            was more in earnest this time. While even with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> performing this surveillance some
                            personnel and arms could slip through, North Vietnamese acceptance of
                            surveillance, including on its own territory would probably be an
                            adequate price for cessation of air attacks.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_399" n="399" facs="0431"/>
                        <p>Other means of checking on <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>'s
                            compliance in a cessation of infiltration are hard to envisage, although
                            one other possibility might be found in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>'s agreement to the free use of unarmed U.S. aircraft to
                            carry out day and night, land and sea reconnaissance anywhere over
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> territory (or at least over the
                            coast and the land area south of Vinh) and over the Laos panhandle,
                            perhaps combined with agreement that if suspicious activity is noted,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could be dispatched to
                            investigate on the ground.</p>
                        <p>It might be that <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would accept no such
                            arrangements without exacting a higher price, such as the withdrawal of
                            the bulk of US forces from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. This
                            might be acceptable to us, since US forces could always be promptly
                            deployed again in case of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            non-compliance, especially if our withdrawal could be staged to postpone
                            any substantial outward movement until a surveillance system in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and Laos was in reasonable operation.
                            However, we should not accept unilateral US withdrawal but should insist
                            that it be accompanied by the pulling back to North Viet-Nam of at least
                            the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> cadres who are leading and
                            directing and providing the technical skills for the Viet Cong
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>If arrangements somewhat as outlined above could be worked out, we should
                            have moved into a state of détente in Viet-Nam which would considerably
                            ease present international tensions. <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            would, of course, still face major tasks of pacification and internal
                            stabilization but these could be undertaken with our help with much more
                            promise of success than we see today. In working our way toward an
                            effective compliance by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> of the 1954
                            and 1962 Accords and some further military disengagement of the U.S. in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, fuller and more formal
                            negotiations and perhaps a conference would perhaps be in order. That
                            would be the time to introduce in specific terms the proposals for
                            Mekong Valley or other types of economic development in Indochina,
                            including <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, which would have the
                            objective of gradually weakening that country's links with Communist
                            China. Such proposals, however, might well be foreshadowed in earlier
                            general public statements.</p>

                        <p>2. Agree with the substance of the four paragraphs which you quoted from
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">Not further identified.</note> However, I feel that
                            the terms “large gains” and “accelerating” are suggestive of changes
                            which are both massive and rapid. Except for Binh Dinh and Phu Yen, this
                            is not the case. The security situation in I Corps and the bulk of II
                            Corps has been steadily deteriorating since mid-1964. The developments
                            in Binh Dinh suggest that we are approaching a point in the
                            deterioration process which must be recognized as critical.</p>
                        <p>3. The overall situation is assessed as follows.</p>
                        <p>A. General: Throughout the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> the Viet
                            Cong hold the initiative. They have had continuing success in their
                            efforts to consolidate political gains in the rural areas; to increase
                            their military strength by a combination of infiltrated cadre and levies
                            on available manpower; and to improve their organization, weaponry, and
                            logistic capability. Through the use of military action, intimidation,
                            and propaganda, they are implanting a sense of the inevitability of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> success. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have a propaganda advantage. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> combat losses are well publicized, but
                            even larger losses of the Viet Cong are shrouded in secrecy, thus having
                            less impact on the people.</p>
                        <p>B. The several corps areas:</p>
                        <p>(1) In I Corps, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have continued to
                            extend their influence through the piedmont and into the lowlands
                            despite some successful, albeit limited, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> operations, and despite serious <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> losses. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have, in
                            effect, isolated the centers of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            strength from access to the rest of the population. In short, they have
                            succeeded in erasing the pacification gains made by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> prior to mid-1964.</p>
                        <p>(2) In II Corps, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces are on the
                            defensive and pacification efforts have stopped. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are expected to commit more forces in the
                            northern provinces of II Corps in an effort to depress <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale further, or, hopefully, force a
                            psychological collapse. Some <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            in II Corps are already in a pessimistic frame of mind and are reluctant
                            to <pb xml:id="pg_401" n="401" facs="0433"/>engage in offensive
                            operations. Meanwhile, Montagnard situation, while temporarily
                            quiescent, may explode at any time. Five battalions of the general
                            reserve are in the process of being committed in II Corps in order to
                            bolster morale and to prevent any further deterioration of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>(3) In III Corps, an apparent force equilibrium has been reached, the Hop
                            Tac campaign cannot move much further forward without substantial
                            reinforcement. At the same time, the general reserve, on which Hop Tac
                            has heretofore depended for reaction forces and for spoiling operations
                            on the periphery, has been committed to other geographic areas. By
                            contrast, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> has the capability of
                            upsetting the equilibrium should they opt to commit part or all of their
                            reserves in the critical provinces surrounding Saigon.</p>
                        <p>(4) In IV Corps while the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> incident rate
                            remains comparatively high, the intensity is low. Only in the contiguous
                            provinces of Dinh Tuong and Go Cong has the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> made any measurable pacification advances in recent
                            months. There are indications that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            are regrouping main force elements into regimental formations and,
                            although the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has recently inflicted
                            some sharp losses on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, they can
                            raise the intensity of military action at any time.</p>
                        <p>4. To make the forecast which you requested, I have taken the above
                            estimates as a base and have projected the trends we now discern without
                            admitting new factors. I recognize that we have already set in train new
                            actions which can significantly affect the power equation. Nonetheless,
                            I have tried to answer the question, “If we continue the course of
                            action we are now following, what will be the situation six months
                            hence?” I am unable to deal with this subject in 60 day increments as
                            suggested—given all the variables at play, such refinement is just not
                            possible. The forecast for the next six months, made under these
                            limitations, is as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, holding the initiative, will
                            increase the tempo and intensity of their activities throughout the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, but most particularly in the
                            northern and central parts of the country. At the same time they will be
                            strengthening existing units, forming new ones, and regrouping the main
                            forces into larger formations while re-equipping them with standardized
                            armament. Concurrently, they will be making maximum efforts to
                            consolidate and strengthen their political organization in areas under
                            their control, to extend population control into contested areas, and to
                            penetrate areas held by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>B. The bulk of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military operations will

                                p.m. and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> at 7:40,
                                and the three men then had dinner together. (Ibid.,
                                    <persName>Rusk</persName> Appointment Book)</note> The following
                            general conclusions emerged:</p>
                        <p>1. On the evidence so far our air actions in North Vietnam and Laos have
                            caused somewhat less international reaction than we expected. The
                            propaganda and the demonstrations are inevitable, and so are the
                            reactions of the would-be negotiators, here and abroad. Your own
                            effective work has brought the American reaction under control, at least
                            for the present. We got an inadvertent assist from <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> on this because his outrageous
                            comments solidified a lot of Congressional opinion. We have not driven
                            the Chinese and the Soviets together, as the Moscow demonstrations and
                            Chinese complaints show. We have certainly not persuaded Hanoi to leave
                            its neighbors alone, but we may have made a beginning. Most important of
                            all, we may be moving, with less friction than we anticipated, toward a
                            situation in which international opinion may regard our actions against
                            the North as a natural reply against Viet Cong operations in the South.
                            If this can be done by continuing our measured and fitting actions over
                            the coming weeks, it will be a new and important change; it will be most
                            helpful to us against guerrilla infiltration over the long run, whatever
                            the eventual result in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that if this result is achieved—and
                                <persName>Dean</persName> says that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> , who has been skeptical, is
                            now quite hopeful about it—it will be your personal achievement. You
                            alone—against your noisiest advisers—made the basic decision to present
                            these actions within the framework of a continuing policy and a
                            continuing purpose, and not as major new departures. The best and
                            simplest documentary evidence of this is in the amendments which you
                            made to the speech which was never given.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">See <ref target="#d108fn5">footnote 5, Document 108</ref>.</note> I
                            am holding that document for your memoirs.</p>
                        <p>2. Two of the three of us think that the chances of a turn-around in
                            South Vietnam remain less than even; the brutal fact is that we have
                            been losing ground at an increasing rate in the countryside in January
                            and February. The air actions have lifted morale, but it is not clear
                            how much, and there is no evidence yet that the new government has the
                            necessary will, skill and human resources which a turn-around will
                            require.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_403" n="403" facs="0435"/>
                        <p>Moreover, our own basic framework for the support of the pacification
                            program leaves a great deal to be desired. (Last night Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said for the first time what
                            many others have thought for a long time—that the Pentagon and the
                            military have been going at this thing the wrong way round from the very
                            beginning: they have been concentrating on military results against
                            guerrillas in the field, when they should have been concentrating on
                            intense police control from the individual villager on up. This is a
                            point which <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> will make in a
                                report<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">See the attachment to <ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</note> which is to be
                            delivered to you Monday afternoon before your meeting with him on
                                Tuesday.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">See <ref target="#d189fn2">footnote 2, Document 189</ref>.</note>)</p>
                        <p>We all nevertheless agree that whatever the odds and whatever the
                            difficulties, we must continue to make every conceivable effort in the
                            pacification area. This is the purpose of the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> mission, and the results of that
                            mission should be available for discussion with you early next week.</p>
                        <p>3. There is one particularly tough issue on which we will get comment
                            next week, both from the <persName>Johnson</persName> mission and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> report. That is the
                            question of the organization and management of the U.S. team in Saigon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I, if the
                            decision were ours to make, would bring <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> back and put <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex
                                Johnson</persName> in charge, with a younger man (conceivably
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName>) as Chief of
                            Staff. <persName>Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and I have all learned from separate channels
                            that within the country team it is in fact <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis</persName> who is looked to for leadership and for
                            coordination. Max has been gallant, determined, and honorable to a
                            fault, but he has also been rigid, remote and sometimes abrupt. We all
                            recognize that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has served
                            an enormously important purpose in keeping American opinion from
                            division and criticism, but our inclination would be to bring him back
                            not later than the first of June for a final round of consultation and
                            discussion, and release him from his duties at the end of the year for
                            which he originally contracted. (He took the oath on July 2.)</p>
                        <p>4. We talked also about our international political position. We all
                            agree that so far we have followed the right course, but we continue to
                            believe that it is important to defend and to insist on our policy in
                            every forum. That is why <persName>Dean</persName> has agreed with
                            enthusiasm to your proposal for briefings of Ambassadors, and that is
                            also why he has taken on this heavy schedule of public appearances in
                            the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>5. There remains a real question in our minds as to how much we should
                            open the door to a readiness for “talks”. This is a point on which both
                                <persName>Dean</persName>, and Bob especially, are quite concerned.
                            They both feel, for somewhat different reasons, that it is important to
                            show that we are ready to talk about Vietnam—always on our own terms—in
                            all appropriate <pb xml:id="pg_404" n="404" facs="0436"/>international
                            channels. They point out that in one sense that is exactly what we are
                            doing now in our briefings of Ambassadors, and in our tough talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, and in public
                            statements which constitute diplomatic actions. But Bob goes a lot
                            further. He believes that we should find a way to have real talks in an
                            international meeting. (I think his motivation is that we will need a
                            conference table if things go worse, as he expects.)
                                <persName>Dean</persName> and Bob both feel that to hold some of our
                            allies we may need to be a little less rigid about “talks” than we have
                            in the last ten days. The particular pressure which is visible today is
                            from the British, who have been made nervous by one sub-Cabinet
                            resignation and a lot of yammering from their own Churches and
                            McGoverns. What the British want is to make some explorations toward the
                            possibility of talks, and to say that they have been in consultation
                            with us. This is not an urgent matter over the week end, if only because
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> is safely in Bonn. It will be up for
                            judgment early next week.</p>
                        <p>My own opinion on the general diplomatic front is that we can always get
                            to the conference table when we need to, and that there is no great
                            hurry about it right now. (<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean
                                Rusk</persName> agrees, though he wants to keep the British just
                            happy enough to hold them aboard.) I think there is a lot to be said for
                            detailed and careful study of the bargaining problem in all the various
                            forms which it may develop. But for the moment it seems to me that we
                            are exactly right to stick on the line which you have set. The one thing
                            we might add is that of course we are willing to talk about ending the
                            North Vietnamese aggression and that talks on that subject in any forum
                            would always be welcome. <persName>Dean</persName>'s backgrounder
                                yesterday<note n="6" xml:id="d183fn6">
                                <persName>Rusk</persName> left his office at 5:05 p.m. for the press
                                background and returned at 5:45. (<persName>Johnson</persName>
                                Library, <persName>Rusk</persName> Appointment Book)</note> went a
                            little way in this direction, and I think we would all be helped by
                            knowing your own reaction to the resulting stories by Roberts, Frankel,
                            et al.</p>
                        <p>6. Bob and I pressed upon <persName>Dean</persName> our feelings that it
                            is important to have contingency planning on what we should do if in
                            spite of our best efforts there is either escalation by the enemy or
                            continued sharp deterioration in South Vietnam. The military planning
                            for reactions to escalation is mostly done, but we do not feel confident
                            that we know just what our actual decisions should be and would be if
                            there were North Vietnamese ground movements over the demarcation line
                            or large movements of Chinese forces into North Vietnam, or both. We
                            estimate both of these as unlikely for the moment, but we have to be
                            ready for them. The crucial question is, in a sense, whether and when
                            you would authorize landings of a number of U.S. divisions in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>A closely related question on escalation is whether it would be useful
                            right now to get a substantial allied ground force in place in the
                            central <pb xml:id="pg_405" n="405" facs="0437"/>and northern part of
                            Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max Taylor</persName> is doubtful
                            about this, but in the heat of discussion last night
                                <persName>Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I all thought it worth serious further
                            exploration. A force which had Australians, Filipinos, Thais, Koreans
                            and conceivably even Pakistanis would also have a substantial braking
                            effect on any possible Communist escalation. We will be asking for your
                            thoughts on this one too.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, on the subject of contingency thinking for sharp
                            deterioration, we agreed, in spite of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean
                                Rusk</persName>'s reservations, that such thinking should be
                            done—but very, very privately. <persName>Rusk</persName> points out that
                            when men even look as if they were planning for defeat, they make defeat
                            more likely, and he is right. So our current plan is that there should
                            be no paper work on this subject at all, but simply some intensive
                            discussion limited completely to the three of us and one subordinate
                            each. There will be no papers, and this mission will not exist anywhere
                            except in this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>8. I need not tell you how helpful it will be to have your reactions to
                            this discussion. There is nothing in it that makes it urgent for you to

                            <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–160–65</p>
                        <p>1. Over the past several months, there has been a series of messages,
                            letters, and discussions regarding the status, markings, mission, and
                            Vietnamese participation in the operation of the two US Air Force air
                            commando squadrons in South Vietnam. You are aware of the long history
                            which accounts for their mission, the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> markings on these aircraft <pb xml:id="pg_406" n="406" facs="0438"/>and the ground rule which requires <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> observers on each mission. The Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff have examined the restrictions placed upon air commando
                            operations and believe that these ground rules have been overcome by
                            events.</p>
                        <p>2. The mission of the air commando squadrons clearly has changed.
                            Originally, they were in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> for a
                            combination of combat and training purposes with the emphasis on
                            training. Because of operational necessity their combat contribution has
                            increased until they are now over 80 per cent combat committed. In this
                            respect, their mission is US support of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> in exactly the same way as US Army and Marine
                            helicopters, US Air Force and Army transport aircraft, and more recently
                            US Air Force tactical fighter and light bomber squadrons. The Government
                            of Vietnam seeks this support and there should be no adverse propaganda
                            results since the Viet Cong have long been charging that the entire air
                            war is conducted by the United States.</p>
                        <p>3. Information from <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            reveals that difficulties are continually encountered in locating <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> personnel to fly in the A–1Es at
                            critical times. A typical example occurred on 27 February 1965 in which
                            an air strike was requested in Kontum Province while the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> was either committed or standing down
                            in preparation for other operations. Four air commando aircraft were
                            alerted and prepared to meet the operational request, but no Vietnamese
                            observers or pilots could be located to accompany the aircraft. The
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff believe it is a matter of operational necessity to
                            relax the requirement of <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> personnel
                            to be aboard air commando aircraft.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe also that it is logical and proper
                            to change the markings on air commando aircraft to identify US units
                            with our own insignia. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            reports that the Vietnamese prefer it. No adverse press reaction is
                            anticipated when this is evaluated against the background of US jet
                            strikes both within the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and against
                            targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The press would find
                            it difficult to believe that any important policy decision was
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the training mission of the
                            air commando squadrons is clearly the lesser of its responsibilities.
                            However, the training mission is essential to the development of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> 5th and 6th A–1H squadrons.
                            Consequently, the air commando training mission will be essential for at
                            least another year. There is no reason why this training cannot or
                            should not be conducted with US Air Force markings.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend:</p>
                        <p>a. The task of the air commando squadrons include:</p>
                        <p>(1) Training as necessary in support of the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>. (2) Combat operations in support of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_407" n="407" facs="0439"/>
                        <p>b. Air commando A–1Es be permanently marked with US Air Force insignia
                            for both in and out of country operations.</p>
                        <p>c. Air commando A–1Es be authorized to conduct combat operations without
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> personnel aboard.</p>
                        <p>d. The action proposed in the attached draft message<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> be approved.</p>

                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> 's
                            commander's estimate in Ref A is the best analysis of the situation in
                            Vietnam which I have seen. So far as the estimate itself is concerned,
                            there is nothing that I can add.</p>
                        <p>2. However, I should like to reemphasize certain of his observations in
                            order to give even stronger support to recommendations I have already
                            made in Ref B as to:</p>
                        <p>A. The increased use of air in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. The necessity for much tighter control over coastal shipping.</p>
                        <p>C. Requirement for use of U.S. forces in security missions within
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>D. The need for a U.S. logistic base within country.</p>
                        <p>3. In <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> 's estimation
                            the war has moved out of the purely guerilla phase and into a more
                            formalized military conflict. It is essential, therefore, that we
                            recognize this transition and react immediately and with our best
                            tactics and weapons. Obviously it is a situation which should allow us
                            to employ our airpower. Anything, therefore, <pb xml:id="pg_408" n="408" facs="0440"/>which can be done to bolster the tactical air control
                            system must be accomplished as a matter of urgency and I will support
                            any new requirements in this area. Similarly I support with enthusiasm
                            the requirement stated for additional experts for the targets research
                            and analysis center and the allied equipment for dfing and <gloss target="#t_IR1">IR</gloss> recce. The target acquisition function is
                            absolutely vital to proper employment of air. You know my strong
                            feelings as to the requirement for the <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss>(-) at Danang. In the light of <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> 's estimate I would put
                            even a higher priority on its employment. Aside from all the other
                            considerations which would argue in favor of this deployment we must
                            give ourselves some insurance against a collapse of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> will or ability to resist in the
                            critical area of Danang where we have so much already committed. In this
                            connection it may again be appropriate to consider establishment of a
                            U.S. logistic base in this area.</p>
                        <p>4. In the matter of sea surveillance and patrol of coastal waters, we
                            are, of course, in the midst of studying and preparing to deal with this
                            problem. Certainly the U.S. Navy should be able to control shipping
                            other than junk traffic off the coast of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>

                                179</ref>.</note> met with US Mission Council for about three hours
                            on afternoon of March 5. Most of time was spent in discussing causes for
                            retardation of pacification program and areas for possible additional
                            effort to eliminate these causes.</p>
                        <p>I opened discussion by expressing view that our basic unresolved problem
                            is provision of adequate security for population; that without security
                            most of our other programs are rendered either impossible or of marginal
                            effectiveness. Given security and reasonable time, all of our other
                            problems will fall into place.</p>
                        <p>Failure to provide security results, I suggested, from three primary
                            causes which, in turn, derive from many secondary and tertiary ones. <pb xml:id="pg_409" n="409" facs="0441"/>These three are (1) lack of
                            satisfactory progress in destroying <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            insurgents in countryside, (2) continuing capability of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to replace losses and increase in
                            strength and (3) our inability to establish and maintain an effective
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Lack of progress in suppressing insurgency is in large measure
                            consequence of insufficient trained military, para-military and police
                            manpower. In spite of build-up of forces in 1964, we have never been
                            able to achieve numerical superiority over <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in excess of 5 to 1 whereas all historical examples in
                            recent past suggest need of superiority of counterinsurgency forces on
                            order of 10–20 to 1. It is essential to make maximum effort in 1965 to
                            raise new forces and improve use of those already in being. Such an
                            effort on part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> calls for an
                            overall improvement, in use of manpower for pacification purposes, an
                            efficient application of conscription law, practical measures to
                            increase attractiveness of military and police service and removal of
                            all bottlenecks which presently impede further increase in capacity of
                            training organization.</p>
                        <p>Limited effectiveness in many provinces of pacification programs which
                            must follow on heels of military clearing operations is another cause of
                            lack of progress against insurgency. These represent, in general,
                            provincial activities of ministries involved in pacification, such as
                            Ministries of Interior, Health, Agriculture, Public Works and Rural
                            Affairs. Throughout 1964 these ministries were weak and ineffective
                            because of governmental instability in Saigon. As result, their programs
                            have lacked continuity and personnel charged with their execution have
                            been constantly rotating. Thus, military successes when they have
                            occurred are frequently not exploited; areas cleared are not held; areas
                            cleared and held are not developed and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            infrastructure remains in villages and hamlets ready to emerge when
                            troops move on.</p>
                        <p>Throughout this period, counterinsurgency efforts have been plagued by
                            popular apathy and dwindling morale, consequences of long war with no
                            end in sight. There is no sense of dedication on our side comparable to
                            that instilled into <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and no popular
                            commitment to suceeding governments which, because of their constantly
                            changing character, have tended to repel rather than to attract
                            confidence and support.</p>
                        <p>Second primary cause of our lack of success, continuing growth of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, I attributed to open frontiers of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, land and sea, which it has been
                            impossible to close to infiltration, uninterrupted activities of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in reinforcing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and continued ability of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to find recruits in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Frontier problem is result of nature; there are 2500 miles of land and
                            sea frontier to police and inadequate means to effect any thing like
                            complete surveillance. Even with vast increases of manpower, ships and
                            other equipment for mission, frontiers can never be hermetically sealed.
                            Land and air incursions by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            into Cambodia, Laos and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could <pb xml:id="pg_410" n="410" facs="0442"/>assist in limiting infiltration
                            but there are valid political arguments which impose restraints on such
                            operations and there is a shortage of manpower which would limit them
                            even if political objections did not exist. These facts do not argue
                            against trying to do better job at closing frontiers but do suggest that
                            there is an early point of diminishing returns for such efforts.</p>
                        <p>The continued support of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is heart of infiltration problem. If
                            frontiers cannot be closed from inside—and we are convinced that they
                            cannot—then only way to stop infiltration is to get Hanoi to order it to
                            stop. Such is fundamental justification for Barrel Roll and Rolling
                            Thunder operations. In combination with 34–A activities, they constitute
                            our principal hope of ending infiltration—and end it we must if
                            in-country pacification is to succeed.</p>
                        <p>It is true that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, even then, would be
                            able to continue to recruit locally in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> where lack of security against terrorism and absence of
                            commitment to Saigon govt have favored <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            recruiters. However, successful application of pressure on Hanoi offers
                            hope of changing many unfavorable conditions which have worked against
                            us in past; one of which has been this past willingness of many country
                            boys to join <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. An improved national
                            morale, consequence of offensive action against Hanoi, may provide at
                            least partial antidote.</p>
                        <p>Causes for our failure to establish and maintain an effective govt have
                            been their roots in historical and racial factors difficult to define in
                            precise terms. <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> has never been nation
                            in spirit and, until recently, has never had govt which people could
                            regard as their own. Even now their instinct is to consider any govt as
                            intrinsically their enemy. They have always been divided by racial and
                            religious differences, which over centuries their alien rulers have
                            sought to perpetuate. As result, there seems to be no cement to bind
                            together various elements of heterogeneous society, no instinctive
                            herding together even under threat of war. Since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and sudden removal of restraints
                            imposed by his dictatorial regime, natural tendency to disunity and
                            factionalism has been allowed free play, both among civilian politicians
                            and among generals. Resulting field day has been marked by series of
                            demonstrations, bonze immolations and military coups which have produced
                            political turbulence of last 15 months.</p>
                        <p>This governmental instability has contributed to most of deficiencies
                            already described in our pacification efforts. Shortage in manpower,
                            inadequate performance of ministries in provinces, popular apathy and
                            poor morale, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> success in attracting
                            recruits all are by-products of weak govt and cannot be completely
                            corrected until some reasonably effective govt is established and
                            maintained for prolonged period—for months at least, perhaps for years.
                            Statement does not suggest that we cannot make significant progress even
                            under present conditions but it does emphasize <pb xml:id="pg_411" n="411" facs="0443"/>unlikelihood of quick results and inadequacy of
                            US aid, no matter how massive, to effect sudden changes in national
                            characteristics and inbred habits which lie at root of our
                            difficulties.</p>

                            our problem, we then considered areas where, if progress can be made, we
                            will be striking at sources of our fundamental difficulties. In this
                            spirit, it was agreed to explore possibility of increased activity in

                        <p>F. Use of US Navy resources to strengthen surveillance of coast and

                        <p>G. Increased tempo for Barrel Roll and Rolling Thunder.</p>
                        <p>H. Expanded use of Peoples Action (Quang Ngai) Teams.</p>
                        <p>I. Increased US assistance in combatting economic blockage of central

                            no doubt in their minds that we do not intend to go to conference table
                            until there is clear evidence Hanoi (and Peking) prepared to leave
                            neighbors alone; and (2) step up our air strikes in southern part of
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in order convince Hanoi
                            authorities they face prospect of progressively severe punishment. I

                        <p>1. Here are <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot Lodge</persName>'s views,
                            carefully drawn in the shape of an informal memorandum which has been
                            handed to me and to no one else. He does want you to see them, and you
                            have his promise that there will be no written “<persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> report” of any sort.</p>
                        <p>2. I also told <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> frankly that
                            it might be troublesome in his and my Party if he were to be seen
                            ostentatiously discussing Vietnam with you again. He said nobody
                            understood this problem better than he, and of course he understood that
                            he was not being consulted as a Republican but simply as a former
                            Ambassador with relevant experience. He will quite understand it if you
                            do not wish to see him tomorrow, but I believe it would be a graceful
                            gesture to give him a phone call at least. Depending on your own earlier
                            understanding with him, you might also wish to have him in to shake
                            hands and to thank him for his work.</p>
                        <p>3. In any case, I will talk with him at length about his recommendations
                            tomorrow before he leaves, and I will also make sure that he is in touch
                            with others around town informally.</p>
                        <p>4. I repeat that <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> was most
                            understanding on this matter and that you have a free hand in whether
                            you talk to him in any way tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">On

                        </list>
                        <p>The following would be in addition to the wise decisions and effective
                            actions which have already been taken:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Pacification</p>
                        <p>Communist subversion-terrorism is the great unsolved problem in South
                            Vietnam. It is also the greatest single foreign danger to the U.S. and
                            the Free World, actually threatening a Communist takeover of many
                            underdeveloped countries. It is, in a sense, a bigger threat than the
                            nuclear, where we have superiority and a well understood procedure.</p>
                        <p>In South Vietnam our military, economic, social and informational
                            programs are individually good. But none of these tools accurately fits
                            the puzzle of subversion-terrorism. The political and executive “glue”
                            to hold them together and bring them to sharp focus is lacking. Until we
                            do this, we cannot win—nor can we convince Hanoi that its aggression is
                            unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>The only overall executive or “generalist” in Vietnam for all these
                            “special” American programs is, as regards counter-subversion-terrorism,
                            the Ambassador. This is not good organization. In Malaya there were
                            “generalists” at every level of government.</p>
                        <p>There is no time for further elaborate studies in the theory of
                            subversion-terrorism. The subject has already been over-analyzed and
                            over-intellectualized. Workable methods are well known. The need is for
                            quick action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 1</p>
                        <p>Some one man in the U.S. Government should now be made responsible for
                            subversion-terrorism; given enough authority; rewarded if he gets
                            results; and relieved if he fails. His representative in Saigon would,
                            under the Ambassador, pull our separate programs together throughout the
                            country to wipe out subversion and terrorism and train the Vietnamese to
                            do the same.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_416" n="416" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>Instead of giving this new official a name connected with
                            “counter-subversion-terrorism”, a positive note might be struck calling
                            it the “Agency for Support of National Independence”.</p>
                        <p>The head of the agency would recruit personnel—less than 50 persons—for
                            whom counter-subversion-terrorism would be a career, for whom it would
                            be the primary interest, and on the basis of which they would get
                            promoted. This does not exist today.</p>
                        <p>This is not said in criticism of anyone; and individual agencies have
                            done good work. But the organization of the whole has obviously not
                            produced the needed result. Neither we nor the Vietnamese are organized
                            so as to give counter-subversion-terrorism the unified thrust which it
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>Counter-subversion-terrorism in its first stage involves military,
                            propaganda, police and political personnel, who carry out: saturation of
                            the popular mind; strict resources and population control (including a
                            curfew); national registration of everyone over 12; detention of
                            suspects; and search without warrant. (In the second stage, at utmost
                            speed, come economic and social measures.)</p>
                        <p>In addition to the existing military and propaganda programs, which are
                            adequate in size, and to the proposed political program, I make the
                            following:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 2</p>
                        <p>Maximum increase in police forces, which is the basic long-term answer to
                            terrorism. (In Malaya the police force was almost tripled.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 3</p>
                        <p>There should be a greater degree of decentralization of the U.S.
                            political effort in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>As an example, I suggest naming a politically-minded representative of
                            the Ambassador who would be in touch with the Cao Dai, a religious sect
                            numbering some 3 million people and another, who would keep in touch
                            with the Hoa Haos, a religious sect numbering 2 million people. There
                            might also be political advisers in the corps area headquarters. These
                            persons could also be “generalists” who would coordinate our present
                            inadequately organized effort locally.</p>
                        <p>The operative concepts should be flexibility and adaptation to local
                            circumstances and problems rather than national programs, centralized
                            direction and control from the center. Every region is different from
                            every other. The program therefore should flow from the bottom (i.e. the
                            people) up, rather than from the top (i.e. Saigon) down.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese have no tradition of national government. They do not do
                            it well. Until the advent of Chinese Communist imperialism, it <pb xml:id="pg_417" n="417" facs="0449"/>never seemed necessary to have
                            a national government. On the other hand, there is considerable vitality
                            in regional, tribal and religious groupings. These local people have
                            shown that they know how to get the word around. We should work more on
                            them, and not hamper ourselves by the classic, diplomatic idea that for
                            us to deal with anything below the national level is interference in
                            internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese lack of a sense of nationhood (in spite of a real sense of
                            peoplehood) makes coups easy, including a “neutralist” pro-Communist
                            coup, the winners of which would ask us to leave—an invitation to be
                            rejected out of hand as specious, spurious and not representing the true
                            interests or desire of the Vietnamese people. The reasons which prompt
                            us to be there now obviously prompt us to stay there until the
                            Vietnamese can stand on their own feet.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 4</p>
                        <p>We should study a situation in which we and the Free Vietnamese hold only
                            the area around Saigon and such places as the coastal cities of Nha
                            Trang, Da Nang and Hue.</p>
                        <p>In the early days of French colonialism there were no major roads and
                            travel was largely along the coast. As part of such a situation we
                            should consider recognition of a de facto government or perhaps working
                            locally without even a semblance of a national government. This is
                            another reason for having a U.S. presence at Cam Ranh Bay. (See
                            Recommendation No. 12)</p>
                        <p>Note: While the pacification record in North and South Vietnam is bad,
                            progress in the key (so-called “Hop Tac”) area surrounding Saigon
                            appears encouraging. According to the weekly <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report of February 24,<note n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">“The
                                Situation in South Vietnam,” February 24. (Ibid., Vol. XXIX)</note>
                            ten more hamlets were pacified during the week, bringing the total to
                            309 (out of a total of 1,146 hamlets in this area) in two and half
                            months and leading to “positive actions by hamlet chiefs to help the
                            people”, which “has rapidly motivated the people to supply the
                            Government with information”. In the report for March 3,<note n="5" xml:id="d189fn5">“The Situation in South Vietnam,” March 3. (Ibid.,
                                Vol. XXX)</note> the figure was raised to 322 hamlets, meaning that
                            some 870,000 people are now reckoned to be living in secure areas and
                            some 448,000 in areas in the process of being secured. All this could be
                            fundamental. It is the way to accomplish something durable in Vietnam
                            which, if done, will surely destroy the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as we have always known it.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0450"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 5</p>
                        <p>This success, if true, should be intensively used as a laboratory to
                            train the people to speed pacification into the rest of the country. The
                            area now being pacified should be a showcase.</p>
                        <p>The seven provinces around Saigon, of which the Hop Tac area is the first
                            phase, cover 40% of the population of Vietnam—and the most important
                            40%. If this gets dependably pacified, the pacification of the rest of
                            Vietnam should be easier.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 6</p>
                        <p>The above appears to be a real success, which, if confirmed by later
                            reports, should be publicized in the U.S. and world press.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Buddhists</p>
                        <p>The Buddhists are crucial in Vietnam. Among the Buddhist clergy are the
                            only Vietnamese with genuine political talent. Weak though the Buddhist
                            clergy's sense of nationalism is, they do not want to be engulfed by
                            Communism. They can be reasoned with. I know of instances when they have
                            been persuaded to change plans which would have caused violence and
                            bloodshed. The outlook is not hopeless. A greater assumption of
                            responsibility by Vietnamese Buddhists could lead to big things within
                            Vietnam; and a greater participation by Buddhist leaders outside of
                            Vietnam might one day be useful in connection with possible future
                            international aspects of the Vietnamese problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 7</p>
                        <p>We should favor distribution of surplus foods through the Buddhist
                            clergy, thus giving them a responsible stake in the preservation of law
                            and order. But this must not be done so as to appear as a bribe. It must
                            appear as a mark of friendship and regard.</p>
                        <p>By doing this, we should facilitate contacts between Americans and
                            Buddhists, which should in turn lead to further friendships.</p>
                        <p>The Communists are actively trying to infiltrate the Buddhist movement.
                            If they succeed, it will be disastrous, not only in Vietnam, but in
                            Ceylon, India, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Japan. It is through
                            friendship, respect and warm personal relations that we can best work to
                            prevent this.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 8</p>
                        <p>There should also be support of Buddhist educational, cultural and
                            religious activities, not only by the Government, but also through
                            foundations and religious groups, including funds for hospitals and
                            schools.</p>

                        <p>It would also be very constructive if the Ecumenical leaders meeting in
                            Rome should strive to bring Catholics and Buddhists together.</p>
                        <p>There is an outstanding priest in Japan, Rev. Riri Nakayama, with whom I
                            am on excellent and friendly terms; who considers that I did him a favor
                            when I first met him in Japan en route as Ambassador to Vietnam; who is
                            highly respected and well known by the Vietnamese Buddhist clergy; and
                            who is well thought of at the Vatican because of his work to protect the
                            Catholic Church in Japan during World War II. Rev. Nakayama is devoting
                            his life to improving relations between Buddhists and Christians; and if
                            you approve the recommendation to help the Buddhist movement generally
                            as regards surplus foods, schools and hospitals, this decision could be
                            tactfully communicated to Rev. Nakayama, which would protect us from
                            being accused of making an attempt to bribe the Vietnamese clergy. Rev.
                            Nakayama is also in a particularly good position to work for good
                            Catholic-Buddhist relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 10</p>
                        <p>The Dalai Lama should be brought to Saigon as an object lesson of the
                            dreadful things Communism does to high ranking Buddhist clergy.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation No. 11</p>
                        <p>There should be a Plan for the Development of Southeast Asia, comparable

                        <p>The inter-action of the <persName>Marshall</persName> Plan and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on each other was dynamic and
                            spectacular in Europe; so can the inter-action of a Plan for the
                            Development of Southeast Asia on our effort in Vietnam. This plan should
                            include the Mekong River, as suggested by the American Friends of
                            Vietnam. But it should also aim at Southeast Asia as a whole, including
                            Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. It
                            should involve the wealth and energy of Japan. It should aim at
                            eliminating illness and widening the area in which justice prevails.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Miscellaneous</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations No. 12, 13 and 14</p>
                        <p>12. Intensive study should be given to establishing a U.S. “beachhead” at
                            Cam Ranh Bay. It is easy to conceive of a situation in which travel up
                            the 60-mile length of the Saigon River to Saigon would become extremely
                            dangerous. Cam Ranh Bay is a deep-water anchorage—with few people.
                            Without constructing anything permanent or expensive, it should be
                            possible to establish a U.S. Naval <pb xml:id="pg_420" n="420" facs="0452"/>presence which could be of tremendous
                            value—politically, militarily and at a conference table.</p>
                        <p>13. Renewed study and drive should be put behind forming an international
                            consortium, under whose auspices the Vietnam operation could be
                            conducted. This could give the Vietnam operation a better international
                            appearance and ought to lead to some increase in third-country
                            support.</p>
                        <p>14. The U.S. Navy, with the Vietnamese Navy, should take intensive
                            measures to prevent the landing of supplies and personnel on the coast
                            of South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>1. Herewith my own capsule appreciation of the unfolding of the scenario
                            in Vietnam so far. It is in accord with the views of most of my
                            Southeast Asia experts but is far too clear-cut a statement to be
                            coordinated easily as an official intelligence community view.</p>
                        <p>2. For your noting, not necessarily for reading, are two of my earlier

                            and what to do about it. You will see I am at least consistent. My only
                            fear now is that we may have waited too long to reduce the pressure on
                            the political and internal security fabric in South Vietnam. It is
                            pretty threadbare, as you know. If it holds, then I believe the course
                            we are on will pay dividends as time goes on.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>It is too soon to tally up the returns from U.S. military pressure on
                            North Vietnam of the systematic kind implicit in the March air strikes.
                            It is clear, however, at the end of this first week that the reactions
                            and results all around are running according to the scenario envisaged
                            beforehand in planning papers and intelligence estimates.</p>
                        <p>1. The first series of air strikes in North Vietnam (7, 8, 11 February
                            and 2 March) inflicted limited damage on military installations
                            associated with infiltration but, of course, as anticipated, constituted
                            more of a political and psychological signal than a major military
                            interdiction of the North Vietnamese effort in the South.</p>
                        <p>2. The 2 March signal seemed to register in Hanoi, Peking and Moscow,
                            causing perhaps more noise and flutter than might have been expected
                            from one raid. The unexpected propaganda barrage was laid down by all
                            three Communist governments condemning the U.S. and trying to deter it
                            from pursuing this campaign of military pressure.</p>
                        <p>3. Hanoi has reacted otherwise by sitting tight, activating the Viet Cong
                            to try to win as much of South Vietnam as possible, hopefully from their
                            point of view all of it, by guerrilla tactics and terror before it is
                            too late. Gains thus won would, of course, be useful at the bargaining
                            table if Hanoi was later obliged to negotiate some sort of settlement.
                            For the present, though, North Vietnamese leaders are, as we estimated
                            they would, decrying any talk of negotiations prior to U.S. complete
                            withdrawal from Vietnam as a way of snatching the fruits of victory from
                            Communist hands.</p>
                        <p>4. There are no signs of open military moves to change the character of
                            the war through the intervention of large-scale regular forces not now
                            engaged, either North Vietnamese or Chinese. Peking has talked very
                            tough, and there are some Chinese Communist precautionary movements and
                            activities which could, of course, presage later military intervention,
                            but this was expected.</p>
                        <p>5. The Soviet Union seems to be about to re-enter the arena with military
                            aid of some kind. This was not specifically anticipated but so far seems
                            to be a minimum military commitment if it is one at all. On the whole,
                            Moscow seems more worried about the dangers of escalation and <pb xml:id="pg_422" n="422" facs="0454"/>anxious to reassure itself of
                            the limited character of U.S. military action than to intervene in any
                            way except purely defensive or political.</p>
                        <p>6. Most observers report that the U.S. air strikes have given a
                            substantial boost to morale in South Vietnam. Unfortunately, as yet
                            there is no appreciable diminution of divisive sparring among political
                            cliques in Saigon. This fact is disappointing, although it should be
                            recognized that strengthening of the national political fabric in South
                            Vietnam is a long-term task.</p>
                        <p>7. The truly discouraging phenomenon is the ability the Viet Cong now
                            demonstrate to dominate large areas of the country previously under
                            Saigon's control and to mount tremendous harassing campaigns against
                            internal security almost everywhere. We are seeing the results of long
                            years of careful Communist preparation, and we estimated that an
                            aggressive, no-holds-barred guerrilla attack would be the Communist
                            response at this stage.</p>
                        <p>8. The crucial question is whether the political and internal security
                            fabric in South Vietnam will hold together under this strain while
                            military pressures on North Vietnam build up over a long enough time to
                            have some effect on Viet Cong instructions from Hanoi, will to fight, or
                            capabilities. This we cannot predict with any certainty so soon after
                            all of the factors in the situation have been stirred up as a result of
                            the 2 March strikes. About all that can be said is that for the first
                            time in many months the U.S. has some initiative and the Communist
                            nations are watching Vietnam with some agitation and concern.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I sometimes wonder how realistic we are with regard to the whole question
                            of negotiations over Viet-Nam. I hesitate to break into print on <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0455"/>this subject, without having
                            been in Viet-Nam for many years. But I have watched it from Hong Kong
                            and, then and subsequently, through Peiping/Hanoi eyes as far as
                            possible. Tentative conclusions come to mind:</p>
                        <p>1. How will the war end? Will it be by the Westernized form of
                            negotiations in which a bunch of people sit around a table and sign
                            documents? Or will it be something that is closer to the Oriental
                            experience of negotiating by a series of actions unilaterally taken
                            which lead to tranquilization? I think the latter is more likely to
                            happen—and I think it is more likely to be successful. This, after all,
                            is the way the Offshore Islands issue was settled in 1958. Moreover, it
                            involves relatively little loss of face—which a formal conference does.
                            Most importantly, it permits the process mentioned in paragraph 2,
                            below, to take place: namely, if the North Vietnamese, after enough
                            Rolling Thunder persuasions, decide to exfiltrate cadre leaders or curb
                            infiltration or stop the terror, we could react by a unilateral
                            cessation of something we were doing at that time which was painful to
                            them. Such a tacit form of “negotiation” would take some time but might
                            be accelerated by secret diplomatic messages about what they and we were
                            doing.</p>
                        <p>2. What will persuade Hanoi to call off the aggression? I believe it will
                            be a combination of elements such as (a) the penalties for continuing
                            aggression (e.g., our bombing of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>),
                            (b) Hanoi distress over Peiping's failure to give the kind of support
                            Hanoi wants, (c) the attractions for stopping the war (e.g., Soviet or
                            other economic assistance), and (d) a settlement process which involves
                            minimum loss of face and indeed permits Hanoi to deal with its own
                            anti-peace elements be they in Peiping or Hanoi itself. I fear it is
                            quite unrealistic to expect that Hanoi will formally agree to withdraw
                            its cadre leaders and stop infiltration as a condition to negotiations.
                            For Hanoi to agree to stop infiltration or to stop terrorist actions in
                            the south or to withdraw cadre leaders would be to admit the aggression
                            it has persistently denied. The only way Hanoi might actually call off
                            the aggression would be through a quiet unadmitted process. This we must
                            permit if we are to get them to withdraw and end infiltration.</p>
                        <p>3. I foresee the distinct possibility that the Vietnamese will become
                            increasingly “nationalistic” about how this war is resolved. They will
                            resent what they regard as the presumptuousness of outsiders like
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>, the Indians, the
                            French, the Russians and even His Holiness the Pope to play the role of
                            negotiators or of arbiters of the fate of the Vietnamese people. This
                            will be whipped up of course by Hanoi. Note the latest NLFSVN position
                                (<gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>, March 8) which states:
                            “South Vietnamese affairs should be settled by the South Vietnamese
                            people themselves…. The South Vietnamese have been and still are
                            resolutely opposed to the scheme of internationalizing the war in
                            Indochina.” As the Americans get drawn into deeper and deeper
                            involvement in South <pb xml:id="pg_424" n="424" facs="0456"/>Viet-Nam,
                            North Viet-Nam will not only try to make out that this is a war between
                            the Americans and the Vietnamese, but it may succeed in establishing a
                            common Vietnamese front (NLFSVN and non-Communist elements) to urge the
                            Americans to get out.</p>
                        <p>4. The real danger in any estimation is not that we will be forced
                            prematurely into an international conference on Viet-Nam but rather that
                            the political sickness and war weariness in South Viet-Nam will bring
                            about direct talks between the Viet Cong and the Government or Hanoi and
                            Saigon or even a triangular talk between Saigon, Hanoi and the Viet Cong
                            (NLFSVN). I could even see a situation where the Vietnamese Government
                            and NLFSVN representatives in a particular area got together and signed
                            a truce or effected some settlement. This could spread like wildfire.
                            Would the US and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces try to
                            quash—and how? All of this makes it desirable to anticipate as far as
                            possible this kind of eventuality in order to avert or, if necessary, to
                            cope with it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has
                            already done some work on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing considerations do not argue against continuing the course
                            on which we are now embarked. Certainly it supports the President's
                            silence on a negotiations approach as well as emphasizing our
                            willingness to return to the Geneva Accords and respect for <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> territorial integrity. We can also
                            expect and should tolerate non-U.S. Government talk about negotiations.
                            This is bound to occur and we should never seem to be opposed to
                            peaceful settlement, as indeed we are not.</p>
                        <p>However, the above-numbered considerations do point to the possibility of
                            a different type of negotiating from that generally anticipated and
                            suggests that our planning might take it into account.</p>

                        <p>a. Restrictions on the Use of U.S. Aircraft. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have requested that all restrictions be lifted on the
                            use of U.S. aircraft in South Vietnam. At the present time they can be
                            used only in emergency situations by special requests. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> have strongly recommended this action.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">In telegram MAC JOO 6127 to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, February 27, <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> requested that

                            implemented, it should permit the development of tactics which could
                            greatly assist in defeating Viet Cong hit and run operations.</p>
                        <p>b. Restrictions on Farmgate Aircraft. Farmgate aircraft are A1H models
                            which are used by U.S. pilots for training Vietnamese pilots. They are
                            marked with Vietnamese insignia and can only be used if a Vietnamese
                            pilot or observer is on board. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            recommend that markings on these aircraft be changed to U.S. insignia,
                            and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> reports the Vietnamese would
                            prefer this. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would also relax
                            the requirement for <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> personnel on
                            these aircraft. Training of the RNVAF would remain the primary mission,
                            however. Farmgate restrictions seem academic in the light of the present
                                situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">See <ref target="#d184">Document 184</ref>.</note>

                            weekend as the result of an <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> press
                            interview. The individual concerned was trying not to release anything,
                            but the reporter came up with an article stating that our rules of
                            engagement would not permit the sort of sanctuary for Chinese aircraft
                            that was available in the Korean war. <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> is pushing hard for this policy, but State has delayed

                                attached.</note> which shows the increased effectiveness possible
                            and reduced loss rate to be expected as a result of the low level attack
                            pattern. Loss rate might be further reduced as a result of greater
                            effectiveness in flak suppression. It is difficult to damage
                            anti-aircraft weapons with high explosives, and the crews of the gun
                            position under attack are able to take <pb xml:id="pg_426" n="426" facs="0458"/>cover while adjacent guns continue firing. Napalm
                            attacks would leave anti-aircraft guns in poor condition, and would
                            follow the gun crews into their foxholes. A new strike proposal which
                            should be coming over soon will probably call for use of napalm. While
                            this seems desirable, it may be useful to append a note of caution such
                            as “great care should be taken to confine napalm patterns to military
                            areas”.</p>
                        <p>c. 34A Air Strikes Against North Vietnam. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> propose to begin small scale <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> air strikes against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> under 34A operations. This issue should receive very
                            serious thought. If the North Vietnamese were subject to surprise air
                            attack around the clock, they would be placed under much the same sort
                            of harassment as our troops in South Vietnam. This should sap their zeal
                            for the war by building anxiety and eliminating the world-wide publicity
                            that follows a large scale attack. In this program we could use single
                            ship or two ship sorties working at low level, thus guaranteeing
                            surprise and few losses. They should use sophisticated armament such as
                            the AGM 12B guided bomb in order to assure high effectiveness. They
                            should also take great care to avoid any damage to civilians. To achieve
                            this sort of effectiveness and control, however, it might be better to
                            use U.S. aircraft instead of the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>d. Hot Pursuit into Cambodia. In the case of Viet Cong forces employing
                            hit and run tactics operating across the Cambodian border, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommend authorization for (1) return
                            fire, (2) hot pursuit to recover prisoners, and (3) hot pursuit while
                            actively engaged. Military factors strongly support this recommendation,
                            but, of course, the political effects will be a critical
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. US aims:</p>
                        <p>70%—To avoid a humiliating US defeat (to our reputation as a
                            guarantor).</p>
                        <p>20%—To keep <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> (and then adjacent)
                            territory from Chinese hands.</p>
                        <p>10%—To permit the people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to enjoy
                            a better, freer way of life.</p>
                        <p>Also—To emerge from crisis without unacceptable taint from methods
                            used.</p>
                        <p>Not—To “help a friend,” although it would be hard to stay if asked
                            out.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Deteriorating situation:</p>
                        <p>(a) Politically, 50% chance of coup within 3 weeks.</p>
                        <p>(b) Militarily, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> has been cut in two
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control in north reduced to
                            enclaves.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Prognosis:</p>
                        <p>(a) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials will adjust their
                            behavior to an eventual <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> take-over.</p>
                        <p>(b) Defections of significant military forces will take place.</p>
                        <p>(c) Whole integrated regions of the country will be totally denied to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(d) Neutral and/or left-wing elements will enter the government.</p>
                        <p>(e) A popular-front regime will emerge which will invite the US out.</p>
                        <p>(f) Fundamental concessions will be made to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(g) Accommodations to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will put
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> behind the Curtain.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Inside South Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>Progress inside <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is important, but it
                            depends more on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efforts and luck
                            than on added US efforts. Nevertheless, whatever other <pb xml:id="pg_428" n="428" facs="0460"/>actions might be taken, great
                            efforts should be made within South Vietnam: (a) To help the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> defeat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, by giving advice and training, obtaining intelligence,
                            providing air lift and strike support, and hampering <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltration; (b) to strengthen the
                            government, its bureaucracy, and its civil-military coordination and
                            planning; (c) to dampen ethnic, religious, urban and civil-military
                            strife by a broad and positive program designed to enlist the support or
                            dampen the opposition of important groups; and (d) to press the
                            pacification program where conditions permit.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Primary program:</p>
                        <p>Each week, two 100-plane high-damage strike days with two important

                        <p>(1) Strikes north of 20# are likely to attract <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s out of Phuc Yen (Hanoi). (Unless <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> hazard becomes great, striking <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> base can be postponed until it fits our

                        <p>(2) China may introduce <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s from Hainan,
                            raising question of hot pursuit into China and of taking out Chinese air
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>(3) <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (Chinese?) air may strike <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> bases or cities.</p>
                        <p>(4) Increased <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities (take city,
                            kill top leaders).</p>
                        <p>(5) <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (China?) may launch ground forces

                        <p>(6) South Vietnamese may panic if threatened by land or air.</p>
                        <p>(7) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may disintegrate out from under

                        <p>(8) World-wide revulsion against killing Vietnamese may develop.</p>

                            out,” and when they patently fail to shape up, we ship out.</p>
                        <p>(b) Publicize uniqueness and congenital impossibility of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> case (e.g., Viet
                                <persName>Minh</persName> held much of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in 1954, long uncontrollable borders, unfavorable
                            terrain, absence of national tradition or administrators, mess left by
                            French, competing factions, Communist <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> advantage, late US start, etc).</p>
                        <p>(c) Create diversionary “offensives” elsewhere in the world (e.g., to
                            shore up Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, India, Australia; to launch an
                            “anti-poverty” program for underdeveloped areas).</p>
                        <p>(d) Enter multi-nation negotiations calculated to shift opinions and
                            values.</p>
                        <p>(e) Shift to Saigon focus of decision and of discussion.</p>

                            conception of what we are trying to do in Vietnam, and how we might best
                            do it. I had planned to pass this on to you early yesterday morning, but
                            decided to wait until after the session with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>. I have made a few
                            modifications as a result of this session, and I share these private
                            thoughts with you for whatever they are worth.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What are we trying to do?</p>
                        <p>Our short-term objective in Vietnam is to restore sufficient security and
                            stability there (whether by “victory” on the ground or by a favorable
                            political outcome) so that we can withdraw the major part of U.S. forces
                            in the confidence that South Vietnam can handle the problem pretty much
                            on its own. At least as important is the need to demonstrate U.S.
                            determination and capacity to assist a hard-pressed ally meet the threat
                            of Communist subversion.</p>
                        <p>To accomplish these objectives, we are embarked on a three-pronged
                            policy: (1) To assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> by
                            political, economic and military means to <pb xml:id="pg_433" n="433" facs="0465"/>pacify the country; (2) To engage in a series of
                            graduated strikes against North Vietnam to force it to stop its support
                            and direction of the insurgency and/or to provide us with greater
                            leverage in any future international negotiations; (3) To discourage any
                            moves toward premature negotiations but, at the same time, keeping open
                            diplomatic channels for satisfactorily resolving the Vietnamese
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Several assumptions underlie our present course. Among the most important
                            are:</p>
                        <p>1. The regime in Hanoi, hopefully at some point short of massive bombing
                            raids on industrial and population targets, will agree to halt their
                            direction and support of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and/or
                            will agree to reasonable negotiating terms. (Possible, but unlikely)</p>
                        <p>2. The effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, when
                            denied the support of Hanoi, will decrease to the point where the
                            insurgency will become “manageable” for the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and, in time, by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> alone. (Probable)</p>
                        <p>3. During the course of our efforts, both against the North and in the
                            South, we will manage to avoid direct confrontation with either Peiping
                            or Soviet forces. (Almost certainly in the South, possibly in the
                            North)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What are our prospects?</p>
                        <p>So far so good: our objectives are fairly realistic; our policy, given
                            the situation, is probably the best that can be devised; and our
                            underlying assumptions have some validity. But Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has raised some fundamental
                            questions at his recent meeting with the Washington visitors (Saigon
                            2879 <gloss target="#t_LIMDIS1">Limdis</gloss>). <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that “the basic
                            unresolved problem is provision of adequate security for the
                            population…. Given security and reasonable time, all of our other
                            problems will fall into place…. Failure to provide security results from
                            three primary causes…. (1) Lack of satisfactory progress in destroying
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgents in the countryside, (2)
                            continuing capability of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to
                            replace losses and increase in strength, and (3) our inability to
                            establish and maintain an effective government.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s presentation
                            points up the basic dilemma we face in Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>1. By putting the emphasis on “destroying the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>” and by thinking in terms of a “10–20 to 1” ratio of
                            counterinsurgency forces to insurgents, we virtually eliminate the
                            prospects of a solution. The fact is that we have killed 100,000 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> over the past few years. And the fact is
                            that we are most unlikely to achieve the desired 10–20 ratio. Clearly
                            our success will depend on something in addition to military
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>2. We cannot count on eliminating the ability of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to replenish its manpower and supplies.
                            We might slow down this support, we might <pb xml:id="pg_434" n="434" facs="0466"/>make it more costly, but if we establish its
                            elimination as a criterion for progress, we had better resign ourselves
                            to defeat.</p>
                        <p>3. If, as a third criterion, we are going to insist on an “effective
                            government”, we also are in deep trouble. I don't see anything ahead
                            that is better than we have now—and, indeed, we may have something
                            worse.</p>
                        <p>What comes out of all of this? I have a queasy feeling that, whatever
                            must be done, must be done in spite of the unlikelihood of our getting a
                            favorable manpower ratio, our eliminating the support of Hanoi, our
                            establishing and maintaining an effective government. These must not be
                            regarded as conditions necessary for success, unless we are now ready to
                            accept failure. This is not to say that we avoid recognizing impending
                            disaster, if that is what we face; it is to say, if that is what we
                            confront, we should get cracking to minimize its implications.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some thoughts after Brooding.</p>
                        <p>This has been simple to write thus far. Now I must be wise, and this is a
                            great deal more difficult. Here are a few ideas—some new (I think), some
                            variants. In no particular order:</p>
                        <p>1. I would continue the bombing against the North, but I would hug the
                            19th parallel and I would concentrate on military, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-associated targets. A critical point I
                            would keep in mind is the maintenance of maximum flexibility; by
                            pressing north too hard, too fast, we can quickly exhaust our options,
                            we make it more difficult to turn the program off or slow it down, we
                            make it more difficult for the Chinese and the Russians not to become
                            engaged. We must avoid a situation in which the scale and weight of our
                            attacks have vastly complicated our problem (i.e., “widened the war”)
                            and/or have raised the pressure for negotiations to an intolerable level
                            (in the U.S. as well as abroad) before we have had time to improve our
                            position in the South. And, finally, I am convinced that, short of
                            pulverizing North Vietnam, Hanoi is not likely to call “uncle”.</p>
                        <p>2. I would continue using U.S. air power against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> targets, but be constantly aware that this cannot
                            substitute for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ground action or
                            for the much more difficult, but much more essential, matter of
                            pacification.</p>
                        <p>3. I would introduce U.S. ground forces on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> (1 Division), and seriously explore the usefulness of 2
                            Divisions emplaced from the Laos Border south of the 17th parallel
                            cutting across Routes 9 and 12.<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">Since
                                writing this, I have learned that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and State take a negative view toward making this
                                kind of disposition. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. I would forthwith decentralize our pacification efforts so that their
                            success or failure does not depend on how effective the government
                            happens to be in Saigon. This obviously does not mean that we can cope
                            with <pb xml:id="pg_435" n="435" facs="0467"/>constantly changing
                            province chiefs. But it is to say that we will be more free than we have
                            been from the chaos and fecklessness of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>5. I would take an area like the Hop Tac (depending on the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> &amp; Co. report on progress there)
                            and create an Ad Hoc Hop Tac Task Force (AHHTTF), comprising elements of
                            all the appropriate agencies under a Mr. Big who, in turn, would be
                            responsible to a Mr. Pacification in Saigon. I would give Mr. Big a
                            considerable amount of authority and latitude to move the programs
                            necessary to secure and develop the area. (Incidentally, I've been
                            talking to a bright American businessman who has been building homes for
                            private ownership, for as little as $100 apiece, in all sorts of strange
                            places. Maybe the Hop Tac area is worth a pilot project?)</p>
                        <p>6. I would re-examine our own (i.e., the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the U.S.) ability to wage guerrilla warfare in the
                            areas under tight <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control. Why can't
                            we be the insurgents? Why can't we put the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in a position, in the many parts of the country they
                            control, of having to mount a “10–20 to 1” ratio?</p>
                        <p>7. I would take some initiative on negotiations, or at least be less
                            negative. In this connection, I'd make a big production of <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName>'s proposal, made a day

                            We could live with this, and it would have the advantage of avoiding a
                            big international conference. While there are some compliance problems,
                            and while Hanoi would almost certainly refuse, I'd put the onus on the
                            North for refusing to acknowledge “the just aspirations of the
                            Vietnamese people”. (This needs more thought and is getting it.)<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">

                            a “B-” program that could get moving immediately is better than an “A”

                        <p>On the evening of March 12, 1968, Vice President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> dined informally at the Soviet
                            Embassy with Soviet Ambassador and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. According to the memorandum of conversation
                            prepared by the Vice President for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on March 15, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed puzzlement at U.S. air strikes
                            against North Vietnam. “Why did the United States bomb Hanoi [on
                            February 7] while our new Premier was there?” queried <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Before <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not committed to heavy support of
                            North Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> claimed,
                            but it was now. Why was the U.S. testing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>? continued the Ambassador. As a socialist state, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was “morally and ideologically
                            bound to come to the assistance of a sister Socialist State. We can't be
                            a leader and stand by and ignore the bombing of the North
                            Vietnamese.”</p>
                        <p>During the lengthy discussion that ensued, <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> explained and defended U.S. actions and asked
                            why the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in its capacity as
                            co-chairman of the conference that negotiated the 1954 Geneva Accords,
                            did not take some initiative and persuade North Vietnam to stop its
                            infiltration of South Vietnam. “You can't police a jungle border,”
                            replied <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>; nor should the
                            United States expect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            pressure North Vietnam while the bombing continued. For a considerable

                            indicated, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had not been

                        </list>
                        <p>I have examined our recent Intelligence Community estimates on Communist
                            reactions to sustained U.S. air attacks on North Vietnam and <pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437" facs="0469"/>find no reason in the events of
                            the past ten days to change the views therein. This judgment is
                            supported by senior staff advisers<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">For one
                                view, see <ref target="#d190">Document 190</ref>.</note> and the
                            Board of National Estimates.</p>
                        <p>We said the initial Communist reaction would be to try to make the United
                            States desist by threats, propaganda, and diplomatic pressure, plus a
                            continuation of Viet Cong attacks in South Vietnam. This is what has
                            happened so far.</p>
                        <p>We also considered how this reaction would change if vigorous sustained
                            air attacks damaged some important economic or military assets in North
                            Vietnam, as would be likely if the strikes increase in frequency and hit
                            north of the 19th parallel. The majority of the members of the U.S.
                            Intelligence Board concurred in my view that in these circumstances the
                            Communists might try to secure a respite from U.S. air attack by some
                            political negotiation and a reduction of Viet Cong activity. We
                            concluded that this reaction was more likely than a Communist decision
                            to intensify the struggle, accepting the destructive consequences in
                            North Vietnam in the expectation of early victory in the South. The
                            State Department stated that the latter reaction seemed more likely than
                            the first. I doubt that these views would change if formally reviewed
                            today.</p>
                        <p>I have only one reservation in this regard. If Viet Cong military
                            strength and capabilities are greater than we have supposed, as a review
                            of the data now in process suggests, this factor might alter the general
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the danger of more extreme Communist military reactions
                            increases as more vital parts of North Vietnam are damaged and as
                            attacks come nearer to the border of Communist China. Conversely, if air
                            attacks reached past the 19th parallel but did not damage important
                            economic or military assets, the reaction would probably be the same as
                            at present—neither Communist concessions nor large-scale Communist
                            military actions.</p>

                        <p>1. In three recent messages to the Department of State,<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">Apparent reference to telegrams 2889, 2888, and
                                2880; see <ref target="#d187fn6">Document 187 and footnotes 6 and

                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>) has made certain proposals
                            concerning a settlement of the Southeast Asia (<gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia) conflict. Basic to these proposals, which are set
                            forth in detail in the Appendix,<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">Attached,
                                but not printed.</note> are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. A program of graduated reprisals should be undertaken against the
                            Democratic Republic of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>).
                            This program, in response to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>-inspired actions in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, would be designed to persuade the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to stop its intervention in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. A broad outline of terms for cessation of the above reprisal attacks
                            would be a strict return to the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962; i.e.,
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would:</p>
                        <p>(1) In the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, stop infiltration and
                            bring about a cessation of the Viet Cong armed insurgency.</p>
                        <p>(2) In Laos, withdraw all Viet <persName>Minh</persName> forces and
                            personnel and recognize that the freedom of movement granted in that
                            country by the 1962 Accords is not subject to veto or interference.</p>
                        <p>c. Probably the best procedure for attaining an agreement and for
                            avoiding protracted negotiations would be to have military
                            representatives of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> meet in the Demilitarized Zone,
                            under International Control Commission auspices and with US observers
                            present. The Laotian Government would have to be associated with these
                            negotiations at some point.</p>
                        <p>2. Subsequently, the US Ambassadors to the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, Laos, and Thailand agreed that:</p>
                        <p>a. Too much reference, especially publicly, to our willingness to
                            negotiate causes confusion in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>,
                            Laos, and Thailand. In these countries, “negotiations” means to
                            negotiate a neutralist (coalition government) solution as opposed to
                            seeing the war through to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_441" n="441" facs="0473"/>
                        <p>b. Our posture should be one in which we make clear that our purpose is
                            to convince the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease its
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>c. Diplomatic activities of countries looking for a neutralist settlement
                            will build up considerable pressures for some form of negotiated
                            solution short of our objectives. We must divert these pressures to
                            Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow as the instigators and supporters of
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the graduated military
                            pressures within the scope of subparagraph 1 a, above, are included in
                                <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss> 967–64, dated 18 November
                            1964, subject: “Courses of Action in Southeast Asia,”<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d420fn6">

                                    Papers: Gravel Edition,</hi> vol. III, pp. 639–640.</note> which
                            sets forth a program designed to destroy the will and capabilities of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support the insurgencies in
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and Laos. Clearly, the efficacy
                            of a negotiated settlement will be largely influenced by the
                            effectiveness of the program.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the above proposals (see
                            Appendix). In summary, they conclude that:</p>
                        <p>a. It is vital that the United States/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            enter into negotiations with the communists from a position of strength.
                            As a minimum, there should be no attempt to negotiate a settlement until
                            US/Government of Vietnam forces have achieved a strong position of
                            military advantage.</p>
                        <p>b. The proposal by the US Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> cease its
                            intervention in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and Laos
                            provides the minimum requisite basis for negotiating a settlement of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia conflict.</p>
                        <p>c. Once having achieved a negotiating threshold, the United States/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/Royal Laotian Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) must not lose it at the conference
                            table. Unnecessarily protracted negotiations caused by communist
                            stalling or intransigence would be a basis for increased military
                            pressures against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, Viet Cong,
                            and the Pathet Lao/Viet <persName>Minh</persName>. Appropriate US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            military posture and actions must be maintained to assure that the
                            communists are aware of the credibility of both the US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            power and resolve.</p>
                        <p>d. Basic to the ultimate settlement of the conflict in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia is whether there can logically be a
                            return to the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962 or whether new
                            international agreements must be developed. Recognizing that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would have to be associated with the
                            negotiations at some point, from the US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> point of view, bilateral negotiations between the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would offer important advantages. Such an approach
                            would enable a more controlled agenda; whereas another Geneva-type
                            conference could be used as a propaganda forum for each participating
                            country, as well as for providing leverage for the neutralization of
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_442" n="442" facs="0474"/>
                        <p>e. Having endorsed an international conference, the communists could be
                            expected to resist bilateral talks. Should the international climate
                            necessitate a reconvening of the Geneva Conference, the United
                                States/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> should delay the conference while dangling it before
                            the communists to induce them to make concessions. Meanwhile, the
                            program of graduated military pressures must be continued
                            relentlessly.</p>
                        <p>f. Undue reliance should not be placed on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as either a mediator or a sole channel of
                            communications to Hanoi and Peking. The Soviets can be expected to seek
                            to advance their own interests at our expense.</p>
                        <p>g. A central problem in the negotiations would be to develop a system of
                            effective safeguards to ensure that the agreements are carried out
                            faithfully. This matter is treated further in the Appendix.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of the military considerations involved in negotiating a
                            settlement of the <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia conflict, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The United States/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> not enter into negotiations with the
                            communists until a strong military position has been achieved, to
                            include a reasonable indication that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            intervention in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and Laos has
                            ceased.</p>
                        <p>b. This paper be considered in the development of a US position on a
                            settlement of the <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>sia conflict.</p>

                        <p>I had 3–1/2 hours of solid conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> on the last evening of Baguio.
                            The following were highlights:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_443" n="443" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>1. Saigon had some difficulty getting a clear picture of exactly what our
                            policy was going to be after the first strike. For example, they thought
                            that our second and more general message to all posts<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">Presumably the circular telegram of February 18
                                quoted in part in <hi rend="italic">Pentagon Papers: Gravel
                                    Edition</hi>, vol. III, pp. 324–325.</note> somewhat expanded
                            the policy as originally stated to Saigon alone, notably in respect to
                            what they interpreted as total freedom of action<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">Presumably a reference to <ref target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> in South Viet-Nam. I told <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> the history of policy development
                            in this period, and that no contradiction or inconsistency had been
                            intended. I also went over in detail the origins of the British approach
                            to the Soviets, which they had also had some difficulty in
                            understanding. The moral seems to be that we should perhaps be a little
                            fuller in our explanation of policy to them. Another point is that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> report<note n="5" xml:id="d199fn5">
                                <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> never went to Saigon.
                            Query whether it should now do so for background purposes, even though
                            it has been effectively superseded by later policy decisions.</p>
                        <p>2. In the course of my review of the various policy discussions in
                            Washington, I stressed that the President was particularly anxious to
                            let our policy speak for itself and not to speculate on its implications
                            to the press. I told <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> frankly
                            that we have been somewhat concerned at the extent of backgrounding
                            being done in Saigon in this direction. We also discussed the Kleiman
                                article;<note n="6" xml:id="d199fn6">A front-page article in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> on March 1 by Robert
                                Kleiman describing in detail the development of U.S. policy toward
                                Vietnam during the previous several months and indicating that
                                according to the “highest American and South Vietnamese officials”
                                in Saigon, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                                had decided to begin a limited air war against North Vietnam as
                                leverage to reach a negotiated settlement. The Department of State's
                                concern over the Kleiman article and the “apparently increasing
                                problem” of leaks to the press was expressed in telegram 1849 to
                                Saigon, March 1. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Vietnam, Vol. XXX)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> and others had seen Kleiman,
                            largely to attempt to affect the Times line, but <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> made clear that his conversation
                            bore no resemblance to the article. Apparently Kleiman himself kept
                            talking about “a political track” and I must say that it remains
                            possible that Kleiman was reflecting his own thinking in large part and
                            merely claiming to have got it from Administration sources. This of
                            course still leaves the mish-mash of specifics about “<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-<persName>Bundy</persName>”
                            and “<persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>” texts, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> quite rightly pointed
                            out that no such labels were even known in Saigon. The mystery is not
                            solved, but my own surmise is that Kleiman put together the burrowings
                            of the last three months and gave it an authoritative label to make a
                            story out of it. Nonetheless, someone certainly did talk to him a little
                            too much.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> complained mildly about
                            the hasty way in which General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>'s trip had been arranged and also queried its
                            vast bulk and rank.</p>

                        <p>4. Commenting on <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName>'s report
                            of his impressions in Hanoi,<note n="7" xml:id="d199fn7">The Canadian

                                trip in a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                                    Johnson</persName> on March 6, which was described in telegram
                                2880 from Saigon, March 7 (see <ref target="#d87fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 187</ref>).</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> particularly noted <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName>'s impression that Hanoi thought
                            we were in effect putting our allies up to negotiating initiatives, and
                            that our military actions were simply desperation measures and a screen
                            for seeking a way out. I asked whether <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName> based this impression of Hanoi's attitude on any
                            specific evidence, but <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName>
                            seemed to think it was largely deduction and atmospherics. (I have not
                            read the full report of <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName>'s
                            impressions.)</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> was totally negative on
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> taking over the police
                            advisory role, much less <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> as a
                            whole. He reported that Westy felt the same way.</p>
                        <p>6. Commenting further on General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>'s mission, <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> expressed the general view that what was needed was
                            less a host of new tactics than giving <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> what he had asked for. He commented that
                            there were a great many requests in the mill which had not been met.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> said that both he and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had been
                            really dubious about the marines going into the north, but had finally
                            been persuaded that the security situation at Da Nang was critical.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> totally supported Jim
                            Killen and said that <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> now
                            was in full accord with others on the need for continued and indeed
                            increased decentralization. He was also making a marked effort to
                            improve relations between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> had a number of reports that
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> morale is now better. He
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> was generally
                            doing a fine job, while noting that he tends to take things into his own
                            hands and is still not very good at delegation.</p>
                        <p>9. Continuing on the theme of whether there should be more
                            decentralization, <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> said he
                            was thoroughly familiar with <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Peer de
                                Silva</persName>'s thesis in this direction. He said everyone agreed
                            that the province chief was the key and should be up-graded and
                            subjected to less harassment from Saigon. Organizationally, he thought
                            that the position of the Corps vis-à-vis the province chief was very
                            hard to resolve on any general basis. Westy at one time had favored the
                            abolition of the division level, but did not now think it was practical
                            politics. One major step—which <persName corresp="#p_KJS1">Killen</persName> had pushed through—was the arrangement now in
                            force to have funds go directly from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Bureau of the Budget to the province chief, not through
                            the individual ministries.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_445" n="445" facs="0477"/>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> noted that both he and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> were now
                            trying to give a number of small dinners for Vietnamese leaders. He said
                            that the going was fairly sticky at these, but that they should pay
                            dividends in the long run. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName>
                            made the interesting comment that, as compared with his experience with
                            Chinese, Japanese, and Thai, the Vietnamese were the most difficult
                            group he had ever encountered. They had very little openness and tended
                            to clam up in each other's presence, and the long strains of war had
                            made them very cagey. He noted that the people as a whole simply do not
                            have the sense of humor and capacity to laugh, even in adversity, that
                            the other peoples have.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> noted that there was some
                            continuing difficulty between <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, with the former suspicious that
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> wanted to resume control of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> problem. He said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName> was doing all he
                            could to allay this suspicion.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> said that he himself had
                            come to the central conclusion that, whatever the importance of economic
                            benefits, security was the crucial and necessarily dominant key to the
                            present situation. He felt this was particularly true in the central
                            provinces, where the deteriorating situation now verged on open
                            conventional warfare.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> thought that the
                            up-grading of the Popular Forces was extremely important, and noted that
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> was now moving some of our
                            Special Forces assets into this field. He said that it was very
                            difficult for the Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> to get away from their basic
                            feeling that the Popular Forces were simply a third-rate armed force,
                            rather than having an essentially different mission.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> said that both he and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> were skeptical
                            that US jets would really have great impact on the situation. He noted
                            that one early operation in Phuoc Tuy had been a complete bust, and said
                            that the fundamental point still applied that air was most useful where
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> units were in definite contact
                            with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and really good forward air
                            control was available. He said that Army-Air Force service rivalry
                            continued to plague the whole air problem, and that the dispute of
                            fixed-wing aircraft versus armed helicopters just was not resolved. In
                            the same character, he had a little the feeling [felt slightly] that the
                            allocation of strikes against the north, as between Navy and Air Force,
                            was affected by a feeling that everyone had to get into the act. He
                            wondered if we could not work out a geographical division, with the Air
                            Force taking on southern targets, perhaps up to the 19th Parallel, and
                            the Navy acting above that point. He said that the involved command
                            chain from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> caused real
                            problems, particularly since the Second Air Division in any case had to
                            handle liaison with the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> on the
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strikes.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> had the impression that
                            experience with the strikes was raising serious doubts whether jets were
                            more effective than A1H's, where the latter could reach the targets. The
                            jets seemed to be more vulnerable to <pb xml:id="pg_446" n="446" facs="0478"/>ground fire, and their speed seemed to increase this
                            damaging effect of hits that hardly bothered an A1H.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName> expressed the hope that
                            authority for strikes against the north could be placed on a “when
                            weather permits” basis. He admitted that Washington might occasionally
                            have to take into account political factors, but hoped that this would
                            henceforth enter in very rarely.</p>
                        <p>16. We concluded with a long discussion of possible negotiating
                            sequences, which I will not try to summarize in this memorandum, but
                            will discuss at the Working Group meeting this afternoon.<note n="8" xml:id="d199fn8">No record of this meeting has been found.</note>

                            additional actions in such categories as the following (the list is
                            illustrative and not exhaustive): close control of the population; new

                            information and propaganda programs; new incentives to university

                            political announcements; increased contact at all levels with political
                            and religious groups; greatly increased decentralization of all U.S.
                            efforts in the light of weakness and instability of central

                            “negotiations.” We now need to examine both our public and our private

                        <p>1. Public position. There is a strong argument for a more detailed
                            exposition of our conditions for peace, and our view of the future in
                            Southeast Asia. It may be wise to have a draft prepared for
                            consideration over the weekend and review on Tuesday,<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">March 23. No draft public statement antedating
                                March 23 has been found. Regarding the drafting of the address the
                                President gave at Johns Hopkins University on April 7 and which
                                dealt with Vietnam, see <ref target="#d245">Document
                                245</ref>.</note> with no commitment as to the level at which such a
                            statement might be put out.</p>
                        <p>2. Our private assessment of the bargaining problem. The existing
                            situation in South Vietnam is bad, and the basic condition of any
                            political negotiation is that it should allow us to continue to take
                            actions which will in fact improve the anti-Communist position in South
                            Vietnam. This means that this can only be done by successful
                            pacification, and therefore our object must be to trade off our own
                            trumps in return for enemy actions which will give us advantage in the
                            South. This will not be easy.</p>
                        <p>In essence, there appear to be three things that Hanoi can do: it can
                            stop its infiltration; it can withdraw forces and supplies under its
                            control from the South; it can order its people not to use force against
                            the government in the South. None of these is likely at present, and it
                            is questionable whether any of them will be ordered under the pressure
                            of our air operations alone.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, we can and should consider at what point we would reduce
                            our air operations against the North in return for actions of this sort
                            by Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary analysis suggests that we might well wish to indicate
                            privately that the weight and locus of air attacks will be raised and
                            lowered in direct relation to the amount of Viet Cong force and/or
                            infiltration we observe.</p>
                        <p>Of course it is not essential from our standpoint that we stop hitting
                            the North before serious bargaining begins. But it may be necessary that
                            we have a public price for doing so, if only to make it clear that our
                            position remains careful, reasonable, and measured.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">e. The shape of an eventual settlement.</hi> Only the
                            broadest outline of this question can be stated now, but there appear to
                            be three general possibilities.</p>
                        <p>The first would be effective pacification of a wholly non-Communist South
                            Vietnam. This is desirable but hardly possible today. If this is our
                            real target, it is doubtful that we want an early settlement.</p>
                        <p>The second is a somewhat Laotian solution, in which a government of
                            national unity would have some members from the liberation front and in
                            which de facto <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control in large parts
                            of the countryside would be <pb xml:id="pg_449" n="449" facs="0481"/>accepted. This is what the French and the <persName corresp="#p_LWS1">Lippmann</persName>s have in mind, and our current estimate is that
                            this solution would be acceptable only if some significant U.S. presence
                            remained, to sustain de facto non-Communist control in substantial areas
                            of the country, including especially Saigon and its surroundings.</p>
                        <p>The third is an explicit partition of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, leaving the clearly non-Communist government in control of
                            as large a territory as possible. This solution might permit a
                            reasonably quick reduction of U.S. forces if real pacification were
                            achieved in the non-Communist territories and if the ground given to the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were sufficiently limited. But it
                            is also probable that continuing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            ambition would quickly lead to a situation in which we would have to
                            return.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear necessary today to decide among these three
                            alternatives. What does appear quite likely is that our eventual
                            bargaining position with respect to all three possibilities will be
                            improved and not weakened if the United States presence on the ground
                            increases in coming weeks. This U.S. ground presence is likely to
                            reinforce both pacification efforts and Southern morale, while
                            discouraging the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> from their current
                            expectation of early victory.</p>

                            been decided, for execution this week. Details this program which

                            to specific timing within period covered. Execution of first action
                            under Rolling Thunder 7 may take place anytime from daylight March 19
                            Saigon time. Although program contains full measure <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> participation, requirement that US
                            and <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> operations proceed
                            simultaneously is dropped.</p>

                            further program we have in mind and to solicit <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> participation as specified therein. You should convey
                            to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that proposed program, on
                            which you will be providing him with further information in successive
                            weeks, is designed to maintain pressure on Hanoi and persuade North
                            Vietnamese regime that costs of continuing their aggression becoming
                            unacceptably high. At same time <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> should understand we continue to seek no
                            enlargement of struggle and have carefully selected targets with view to
                            avoiding undesirable provocation. Further objective is to continue
                            reassure Government and people South Viet Nam we are and will continue
                            fight by their side and we expect they will also be making maximum
                            efforts in South Viet Nam where a real setback to Viet Cong would do
                            more than perhaps anything else to persuade Hanoi stop its
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>With initiation Rolling Thunder 7 we believe publicity given US and
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> strikes should be
                            progressively reduced, although in its place there should be picture of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US pursuing with regularity
                            and determination program against the North to enable South restore its
                            independence and integrity and defend itself from aggression from North.
                            Larger strikes (Rolling Thunder 7A and 7B) should be announced as before
                            but suggest in future that such announcements not contain references to
                            Viet Cong atrocities, etc. Instead these matters, which should get full
                            attention, might be subject of separate and perhaps regular press
                            briefings by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with full US
                            support.</p>
                        <p>As regards route recce, we question whether we should take initiative to
                            announce these missions since this could contribute to impression of
                            substantial increase in activity. At same time we presume reporters will
                            get wind of these missions, Hanoi will report them and <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> may not wish maintain silence.
                            Therefore seems difficult avoid replying to inevitable press questions.

                        <p>2991. For the President. The past week was relatively quiet on the
                            internal political front. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            announced his government's short-term program on March 12, covering the
                            five problem areas of security, foreign affairs, “building of
                            democracy”, economic and social development, and education and youth.
                            Shrewdly enough, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> has
                            included some items in his program on which he can already show
                            progress, such as the abolition of certain miscellaneous taxes affecting
                            lower income groups and the convening in Saigon of a conference of
                            Vietnamese diplomatic mission chiefs.</p>
                        <p>During the week, the government also announced that it was investigating
                            one of the peace groups which appeared a week or so ago and that three
                            of the leaders would be turned over to General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> for “deportation beyond the 17th
                            parallel.” Shortly thereafter, <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> announced that he proposed to strap parachutes on
                            them and drop them beyond the 17th parallel, but <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> quickly put a hold order on this
                            proceeding. Indications now are that the culprits will be expelled by
                            more prosaic means on the ground.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is
                            deliberately keeping himself in the public view. In the period of a few
                            days he has held a well-publicized reception for “out” politicians, met
                            both with the National Legislative Council and the press on his
                            government's program, has appeared with his diplomatic mission chiefs
                            now convened in Saigon, has given a television interview to the three
                            major U.S. networks, and has presided over the inauguration of a
                            conference of province chiefs and other representatives. This is all to
                            the good.</p>
                        <p>The Buddhist Institute continues to twist, turn and exhibit signs of
                            uncertain direction. Shortly after <gloss target="#t_Thich1">Thich</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName> issued his peace
                            proclamation last week, the Buddhist Institute issued a communiqué which
                            seemed directed at pressuring <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang
                                Lien</persName> into abandoning his peace movement. At about the
                            same time, <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName> handed us
                            his letter to you on which we have reported separately,<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">Not further identified.</note> an action indicating
                            that he is not yet prepared to drop his peace plans. Clearly, the
                            Buddhist Institute is not wholly together on the issue of peace
                            activities and the serious Institute leaders are wrangling over them.
                            Hence, we are withholding comment for the moment on how to respond to
                                <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Lien</persName>—if at all.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>I spent Tuesday, March 16, visiting key points in the II Corps where we
                            have been particularly concerned over the declining military situation
                            and the growing refugee problem. I would say that the military situation
                            is looking up somewhat but that the refugee problem is very serious.
                            General Co, commanding II Corps and his division commanders are
                            regaining confidence after a week which included a number of local
                            military successes over the Viet Cong. However, the Viet Cong pressure
                            on the civil population of the I and II Corps over recent months has
                            caused some 160,000 men, women and children to leave their homes in the
                            hills and the piedmont to take refuge in the towns of the coastal plain.
                            They are living huddled in temporary camps, not hungry but unhappy in
                            the squalid dullness of their lives and the uncertainty of their future.
                            The U.S. Mission and the government are fully alive to the problem and
                            are formulating specific actions and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>With the growing pressure on North Viet-Nam, the psychological atmosphere
                            continues to be favorable. What is still missing in this new atmosphere
                            is the image of a Vietnamese Government giving direction and purpose to
                            its people. As noted above, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            is begining to pick up speed, but he can not yet be said to have
                            established communication with the Vietnamese people. However, it is too
                            early to say that he may not with time. We will keep pressing.</p>

                        <p>1. We need unified control and direction of psychological warfare under

                        <p>2. We need a substantially increased effort which can be supported
                            largely by other agencies, but will need additional money within <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. There will be a difficult and continuing problem of getting the

                        <p>Within this general framework <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>

                        <p>He also asks for:</p>

                        <p>an increased administrative role for his people in the field (there is

                            This is a problem which I think you already recognize.</p>
                        <p>I have checked with State and Defense and I find general support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>'s approach and a
                            readiness to encourage <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> in going
                            forward. Kermit Gordon agrees that these things will need more money,
                            but he is not yet prepared to accept <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>'s suggestion of an FY-66 supplemental, since he
                            thinks you may wish to have <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>
                            find the money elsewhere in his own budget. (That of course always

                            move helicopters from Danang to the strip and thereby reduce field
                            congestion at Danang. Because of the military advantages of thus
                            rounding out the <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss>, I have no
                            reluctance in agreeing to the merit of his recommendation which, of
                            course, should receive the concurrence of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> after that of Washington.</p>
                        <p>This proposal for introducing the <gloss target="#t_BLT1">BLT</gloss> is
                            a reminder of the strong likelihood of additional requests for increases
                            in U.S. ground combat forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Such requests may come from the U.S. side, from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            <pb xml:id="pg_455" n="455" facs="0487"/>side or from both. All of us
                            here are keenly aware of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> trained
                            military manpower shortage which will exist throughout 1965 and which
                            probably can be rectified only in part by an accelerated mobilization.
                            We will soon have to decide whether to try to get by with inadequate
                            indigenous forces or to supplement them with third country troops,
                            largely if not exclusively U.S. This matter was discussed with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName> during his recent
                            visit who no doubt has raised it following his return to Washington.
                            This message examines the pros and cons of such an action—specifically
                            defined as the introduction of a U.S. division (appropriately modified)
                            into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of introducing a division would be primarily to relieve the
                            present shortage of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units either
                            by replacing <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in the defense of key
                            installations or by engaging in active operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in conjunction with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. Such a reinforcement would allow a
                            strengthening of military efforts in the I and II Corps areas where the
                            situation is deteriorating and would give a boost to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale, military and civilian.
                            Likewise, it should end any talk of a possible U.S. withdrawal and
                            convince Hanoi of the depth of our resolve to see this thing through to
                            a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>This statement of the purpose of introducing a U.S. division is, in
                            effect, a tabulation of the arguments in favor of so doing. However,
                            there are counter arguments on the other side of the case. The
                            introduction of a U.S. division obviously increases U.S. involvement in
                            the counterinsurgency, exposes greater forces and invites greater
                            losses. It will raise sensitive command questions with our <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> allies and may encourage them to an
                            attitude of “let the United States do it.” It will increase our
                            vulnerability to Communist propaganda and third country criticism as we
                            appear to assume the old French role of alien colonizer and conqueror.
                            Finally, there is considerable doubt that the number of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces which our action would relieve
                            would have any great significance in reducing the manpower gap.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to reach a conclusion with regard to the overall merit
                            of this action without first examining in some detail the possible
                            missions which could be assigned a U.S. division. There are two obvious
                            possibilities; the first, the assignment of the division to one or more
                            of the provinces of the high plateau where the climate is good, the
                            terrain relatively open, and the Montagnard population more readily
                            distinguishable from the alien Viet Cong. Here, our forces could utilize
                            their mobility and firepower effectively and make an important
                            contribution in cutting off the growing infiltration into and through
                            this area. For the most part, the Montagnards are friendly to the U.S.
                            and our forces would thus be operating in a relatively friendly
                            environment.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, such a mission in the highlands would place our forces
                            in an area with highly exposed lines of communication leading to <pb xml:id="pg_456" n="456" facs="0488"/>the coast. Their location in
                            this area would create serious logistic problems because of the
                            difficulty of the movement of land transport through areas infested by
                            the Viet Cong. There would be problems both of reinforcement and of
                            withdrawal because of this precariousness of land communications.
                            Finally, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may question the
                            introduction of sizeable U.S. forces into the Montagnard area where we
                            have often been accused of favoring the Montagnards over the Vietnamese
                            and of encouraging Montagnard separatism.</p>
                        <p>The other role which has been suggested for U.S. ground forces is the
                            occupation and defense of key enclaves along the coast such as Quang
                            Ngai, Qui Nhon, Tuy Hoa and Nha Trang. Such a disposition would have the
                            advantage of placing our forces in areas of easy access and egress with
                            minimum logistic problems associated with supply and maintenance. The
                            presence of our troops would assure the defense of these important key
                            areas and would relieve some <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces
                            for employment elsewhere. The troops would not be called upon to engage
                            in counterinsurgency operations except in their own local defense and
                            hence would be exposed to minimum losses.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, they would be engaged in a rather inglorious static
                            defensive mission unappealing to them and unimpressive in the eyes of
                            the Vietnamese. Operating in major population areas would maximize the
                            points of contact with Vietnamese and hence maximize the possible points
                            of friction. The division would be badly fragmented to the extent that
                            its command, control and supervision would be awkward.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing analysis leads me to the following tentative conclusions.
                            First, it is desirable to introduce a U.S. division into South Viet Nam
                            unless there are clear and tangible advantages outweighing the numerous
                            disadvantages, many of which have been noted above. One must make a
                            definite determination of the numbers and types of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces relieved by the introduction of
                            the U.S. unit and thus the effect of the increased U.S. presence in
                            closing the manpower gap of 1965. Obviously, our division would make
                            some contribution but it remains to be proved that it will be sufficient
                            to reverse the downward trend and give such a lift to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces that they would perform better
                            by the stimulation of the U.S. presence rather than worse in a mood of
                            relaxation at passing the Viet Cong burden to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>If the evidence of the probable effectiveness of this U.S. contribution
                            is convincing, then the matter of mission becomes the primary question.
                            The inland mission in the highlands is clearly the more ambitious and,
                            if well done, will make a greater contribution during the present
                            critical period. On the other hand, it is the more exposed and even
                            permits one to entertain the possibility of a kind of Dien Bien Phu if
                            the coastal provinces <pb xml:id="pg_457" n="457" facs="0489"/>should
                            collapse and our forces were cut off from the coast except by air.</p>
                        <p>The coastal enclave mission is safer, simpler but less impressive and
                            less productive than the inland mission. The contrast of the pros and
                            cons of the two suggests the desirability of reexamining the question to
                            see whether the advantages of the inland disposition could not be
                            combined in some way with the retention of a base coastal area, linked
                            with a position inland. In any case, considerable additional study is
                            required before we are prepared to make a recommendation either for the
                            introduction of a division or for the assignment of its mission. In the
                            meantime, we should be giving much thought both in South Vietnam and in
                            Washington as to the right course of action if and when this issue
                            becomes pressing—as it shortly will.</p>

                        <p>7. South Vietnam: In answer to the Secretary's question as to our current
                            appraisal of the situation in South Vietnam, I reviewed the highlights
                            of the joint <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>/State memorandum on the strength of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military forces in South Vietnam, dated

                            estimates have been correct to date but it remained to be seen what the
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and ChiCom reaction would be to
                            a higher level of Rolling Thunder. I reiterated my view that while we
                            felt overt Chinese Communist and <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            military reaction improbable, at the <pb xml:id="pg_458" n="458" facs="0490"/>same time it was definitely a possibility and we must
                            be always prepared to meet any possible enemy reaction. It is not enough
                            merely to plan on the probable. The Secretary seemed depressed over the
                            outlook and not at all sure the actions we were taking would bring about
                            results. He expressed concern over the fragility of the political
                            situation, lack of leadership, high level of Viet Cong strength, etc. He
                            asked that we examine the weather situation over the next several months
                            and its possible effect on both the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and I
                            exchanged views on several matters of mutual interest as follows:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_459" n="459" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>1. South Vietnam: We agreed that the internal political situation was
                            very fragile and neither of us could express much hope or enthusiasm for
                            either the military or political leadership in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. I expressed particular concern over Gen. <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concurred.</p>
                        <p>2. We both agreed that the military situation had degraded considerably
                            since November-December, with the Viet Cong demonstrating an increasing
                            capability and the South Vietnam military weakening by comparison.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that so far he
                            felt the strikes in the north had had little effect. I said that results
                            had been exactly as we had estimated, i.e., considerable propaganda and
                            noise out of Hanoi, Peiping and Moscow (but really less than we
                            expected) and some step-up in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            activities, but no overt moves by either Hanoi or Peiping and no attempt
                            to topple the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government.</p>
                        <p>With respect to more intensified strikes, I said that when they reached
                            the point of threatening the industrial base and hence the total economy
                            of North Vietnam, the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would probably
                            tamp down their guerrilla operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and wait for a sunny day, making some pretense at
                            negotiations. This, I felt, was the most probable course of action by
                            the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> but there was a possibility that
                            they might put on a “burst operation” in South Vietnam in an effort to
                            defeat the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, topple the government,
                            and force the removal of Americans. I pointed out that State leaned in
                            the direction of the latter possibility; the balance of the intelligence
                            community felt the former more probable.</p>
                        <p>4. I made reference to the March 17th <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>-State reappraisal
                            of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">See <ref target="#d205fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    205</ref>.</note> and, in response to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s question, stated that we
                            felt there was a strong possibility that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had 50,000 regulars and 100,000 irregulars and that this
                            level had been reached because <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            strength was under-estimated 18 months or 2 years ago and the amount of
                            augmentation in recent months had been also under-estimated. This
                            combination of circumstances led us to the opinion that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength may be 50% greater than
                            reported. I pointed to the conservatism of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s estimates and the fact that information concerning
                            new units did not get through the combined <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> bureaucracy and
                            therefore show in the official estimates for almost 13 months after a
                            prisoner or a document was captured.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed surprise at
                            the figures and said if these were true, we were “simply outmanned.” He
                            expressed concern over the effectiveness of bombing, distress over the
                            fact that many women and children would be killed, and the guerrilla
                            wars could not be won from the air.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_460" n="460" facs="0492"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that he felt
                            that the internal situation would continue to degrade and that it would
                            not be long until we ran out of worthwhile targets in the north. Hence
                            our position would become increasingly difficult.</p>
                        <p>6. With respect to the 21 suggested proposals of General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">See <ref target="#d197">Document 197</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated they were all
                            being approved. A few of them are being coordinated with State because
                            of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s participation. These did not
                            involve approval of <persName>Johnson</persName>'s proposals in B. and
                            C., which involve the deployment of divisions. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> seemed to feel we should make
                            some moves indicating an intention for more dramatic action such as the
                            movement of forces, possibility of call-up of reserves, etc. He thought
                            these actions were useful in the Berlin crisis even though none of the
                            forces were used or even deployed.</p>
                        <p>7. On other subjects, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            thought his budget talks were going along very well; expressed great
                            concern over the military pay bill, which he felt was divisive, and
                            seemed highly critical of the Congressmen who are introducing it.</p>

                            Hanoi showed a disposition to move toward a settlement. Although we
                            cannot see very far down the road on this at the present time, we
                            obviously need to get our thoughts in order and to consider whether we
                            should, in some subtle way, revise or amplify our present formula that
                            Hanoi must simply cease its aggression. The British also tell us that

                            and he feels that we should be consulting fairly soon with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on our thinking.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Elements of the problem.</p>
                        <p>A. We assume that we are dealing with Hanoi, not with Peiping and not
                            with the Liberation Front. Our “dealing” could be direct, indirect
                            through third parties, or might in the early stages be through public
                            signals and reciprocal actions only without any contact.</p>
                        <p>B. We can identify the principal bargaining elements as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">On the US side:</p>
                        <p>1. Cessation of our attacks against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Cessation of overt US military action in some categories (e.g., air
                            attacks) within South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. Withdrawal of any major US military units from South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. Withdrawal of our military presence from South Viet-Nam, at least down
                            to Geneva levels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">On Hanoi's side:</p>
                        <p>5. Cessation of infiltration so that we are satisfied that it has
                            stopped, or under a system of reliable supervision and inspection.</p>

                        <p>7. Withdrawal and/or demilitarization of infiltrators within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">On both sides:</p>
                        <p>8. Complete cease-fire and regroupment in the south.</p>
                        <p>9. Measures to determine the future political organization in the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>C. Our objective remains to remove all <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> interference in the south, so that <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> can determine its own future and so
                            that its security will be assured. Since we cannot readily expect Hanoi
                            simply to call the whole thing off at once, we should be thinking in
                            terms of a sequence that would accomplish our objective but still leave
                            them some “face” at each stage and that will be plausible to the world
                            and consistent with the stated basis of our action, against aggression
                            from the north. Such a graduated sequence also conforms to the practical
                            way the cards might play.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_462" n="462" facs="0494"/>
                        <p>D. The issues really divide into four:</p>
                        <p>1. Possible preconditions for the cessation of our attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. The future political structure of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The future international status of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Policing and supervising machinery for any of the above.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The immediate problem: Preconditions for the
                            cessation of our attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We believe that we must include a cessation of infiltration, at least to
                            the point where we are satisfied that it has stopped or dwindled to a
                            trickle, but that we cannot stop there. Whereas we might have thought
                            nine months ago that, without further infiltration, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could be fairly readily handled over a
                            period of time, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength is now such
                            that, from a military standpoint alone, they might still be in a
                            position to make dangerous gains.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we would have to insist, both for practical reasons and in logic,
                            on a second condition concerning the degree of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> continued action in the south. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> thought that we should
                            insist that Hanoi direct the complete cessation of all <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity. However, most of us think this
                            is too much to expect, and that it would suffice to insist on a
                            cessation of organized unit action of any significant size.</p>
                        <p>These two preconditions would in effect thus be reduced to practical and
                            recognizable terms. We would not be insisting that adequate supervising
                            machinery be in place on the infiltration issue—this would require major
                            deployments by some international grouping, and simply could not be
                            arranged readily. We would not be insisting on a complete “cease-fire”.
                            We would be establishing a practical and indeed somewhat elastic
                            standard and saying in effect: “We will know if you go on with the
                            infiltration and we will know if there are significant <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions. If either of these happens, we
                            are reserving the right to resume our attacks on any scale
                            required.”</p>
                        <p>The result could well be a sort of twilight zone period in which we might
                            in fact be continuing occasional attacks, but in which the situation
                            might be settling down at least to the point where more formal
                            discussions could be held.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. The next phase: Determining the future
                            political structure of the south.</p>
                        <p>Here our basic position could well be that we favor an appropriate
                            determination of the will of the people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, provided that all external interference is removed.
                            Once that interference is gone, we for our part would be prepared to
                            withdraw our forces.</p>
                        <p>In practice, this position would almost certainly lead to a very long
                            drawn-out process.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>Perhaps the first crucial question would be the freedom of action of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces. If they moved into areas
                            now controlled by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, there would
                            almost certainly be clashes which we would find it hard to justify as a
                            basis for resuming attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.
                            We need to explore just what the exact limits of nominal “government
                            control” are and to see if a practical guideline would be freedom of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces to operate in these
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>But even this would leave enclaves of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            control scattered throughout the country. In theory, we could meet these
                            by some procedure for regroupment and for repatriation to the north of
                            those who had come from there. In practice, this would be a very
                            difficult procedure to carry out. We might make an amnesty proposal,
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> then free to move into
                            areas where the amnesty offer had been extended. But we almost certainly
                            could not accept a hardening of somewhat legalized <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>On the political side, Hanoi would almost certainly demand a legalized
                            role for the Liberation Front. This we should resist, insisting on the
                            removal of external interference or its equivalent, the disarming of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>What is clear is that we cannot let the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            dig in, in the fashion of the Pathet Lao provinces of Laos, and that any
                            explicit partitions of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, even if it
                            were possible without looking like a case of measles, would likewise
                            invite a resurrection of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity. We
                            have to insist on the gradual elimination of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control, but we may probably have to accept that this
                            would have to be done in such a way that there could be a genuine
                            determination of the will of the people.</p>
                        <p>For this reason alone, it is very difficult to see this stage taking
                            place without there having been created a fairly substantial
                            international machinery. And this in turn virtually requires a major
                            multilateral negotiating process. In short, once we had obtained the
                            preconditions for the cessation of our attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, we should not only not reject, but
                            should positively welcome and seek a conference situation.</p>
                        <p>A second possible function for international machinery would be to verify
                            and insure the permanent cessation of infiltration. In this connection,
                            we could consider whether it would be wise to be prepared to withdraw
                            our organized combat units in return for such machinery. This would have
                            the rationale that these units had been the necessary insurance against
                            a recurrence of infiltration.</p>
                        <p>In general, we should recognize that the presence of additional US
                            organized combat units could become a valuable negotiating card either
                            in this or some other way, and that such forces would in any event
                            greatly help to stabilize the situation that might exist after the
                            preconditions were satisfied but while major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units were still in place within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In sum, a rough sequence in this phase might be:</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_464" n="464" facs="0496"/>
                        <p>1. A consolidation of government control in all areas even more or less
                            now under government control, but leaving the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> unmolested in their areas.</p>
                        <p>2. A regroupment or amnesty progressively applied to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> areas, under international
                            supervision.</p>
                        <p>3. International supervision of the infiltration routes.</p>
                        <p>4. Withdrawal of US organized combat units.</p>
                        <p>5. Some procedure for “determining the will” of the people of South
                            Vietnam. This again would appear to require international supervision,
                            and might conceivably be done on the basis of layers of local elections
                            (as in Pakistan), leading to a national convention. Any popular
                            referendum would appear extraordinarily difficult to carry out,
                            especially in terms of framing the propositions to be put.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Future International Status of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Generally.</p>
                        <p>This point appears to be under much better control than any of the
                            others, in that we have repeatedly indicated (as has Hanoi verbally) our
                            support of the 1954 provisions—no adherence to an alliance, no military
                            bases, limited external military personnel for training only.</p>
                        <p>We could also argue strongly that until a political structure was
                            established within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, it was premature
                            to seek any modification of the 1954 status, since the will of the new
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> Government itself should have
                            great weight.</p>
                        <p>By the same token, any issues on the future status of the Indochina
                            successor states as a whole, much less the rest of mainland Southeast
                            Asia, could and should be deferred. Again, we already have a clear
                            position—the 1962 Accords for Laos and neutrality for Cambodia.We
                            certainly do not want to raise any question of Thailand's status, and we
                            could well stick to the fundamental proposition that the nations of the
                            area should determine their own future status, either on an individual
                            basis or in some collective framework as they see fit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Actions in the Near Future.</p>
                        <p>Here we have two questions—whether to amend our public posture, and what
                            to discuss with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the first point, it is obvious that the cessation of infiltration (to
                            our satisfaction) and the cessation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            organized unit actions are not by any means a cessation of the whole
                            aggression as we have been using the term. Hence, to announce this
                            modification in our position publicly would almost certainly be regarded
                            as a retreat, and a suggestion that we might retreat still further—e.g.,
                            to the early Canadian suggestion (to the Soviets and without our
                            consent) that we might cease our attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> merely in return for some reduction in the scale of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity.</p>
                        <p>This leaves the tactical question of when and to whom we should indicate
                            our preconditions. They could certainly be discussed with the <pb xml:id="pg_465" n="465" facs="0497"/>British without leaking, but
                            equally without any chance of their reaching Hanoi. The Canadians could
                            convey them to Hanoi more or less directly, but this too may be more
                            eager than we now wish to appear.</p>
                        <p>On balance, we are inclined to think that the first hint of possible give
                            in Hanoi's position will probably come to us through the Soviets on a
                            private basis. This would then probably be the best time to indicate our
                            position.</p>
                        <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, we are inclined to think
                            that we could safely discuss with them the whole of our thinking under
                            II and the broad outlines of our positions under III and IV. Our
                            position under II is sufficiently favorable so that we do not believe
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would see in it any signs of
                            weakening. They could probably be persuaded also that any early true
                            “cease-fire” might run into the question of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> freedom of action, and is thus much less desirable than
                            the sequence here discussed.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–204–65</p>
                        <p>1. This memorandum presents the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff for deployment of US forces to the Republic of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>) for combat missions, as one among
                            several measures required by the present grave situation in that
                            area.</p>
                        <p>2. The basis for these recommendations is that during the past four to
                            six months there has been a marked deterioration in the military
                            situation in Vietnam in relation to that of the preceding period. In the
                            period immediately following the removal of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, there were serious political problems in Saigon,
                            but the armed forces remained relatively unaffected, and capable of
                            substantial military accomplishments. The principal problems were
                            political: how to achieve governmental stability, avoid <pb xml:id="pg_466" n="466" facs="0498"/>disruptive coups, and extend
                            governmental control throughout the provinces. More recently a major
                            military problem has arisen. The Viet Cong have grown substantially
                            stronger, and have achieved increasing military successes. Moreover,
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> military effectiveness appears
                            to have declined as a result of the political involvements and
                            maneuverings of key military figures. It is the view of the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff that the military situation has become critical, and that, if
                            present trends are not reversed, the counterinsurgency campaign in South
                            Vietnam will be lost. Also, it is their view that such a loss would be a
                            US defeat, which we cannot afford and which would be recognized
                            world-wide as such.</p>
                        <p>3. The needs of the military situation have become primary, and direct US
                            military action appears to be imperative if defeat is to be avoided. The
                            type of military action envisaged will open a new phase of combat and
                            will require substantial shifts in the methods of conducting the war,
                            including a change in the form and scope of US operations, and
                            modifications to US policies and programs which have provided the basis
                            for US support of the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Certain recommendations toward arresting the present trend have
                            already been submitted to you, and further proposals in addition to
                            those in this memorandum are being prepared on an urgent basis. They
                            have included and will include proposed actions both within and outside
                            the country. It is the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that more
                            forceful application of military pressures against both the Viet Cong
                            and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is necessary, including the
                            deployment of forces to deter ChiCom aggression and to provide the
                            capability to increase the intensity and severity of air attacks against
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The recommendations herein for
                            actions within the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> are considered an
                            essential component of the broader program.</p>
                        <p>5. It has become apparent that the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            urgently needs substantial increases in effective combat forces in order
                            to withstand the Viet Cong. The requirement is not simply to withstand
                            the Viet Cong, however, but to gain effective operational superiority
                            and assume the offensive. To turn the tide of the war requires an
                            objective of destroying the Viet Cong, not merely trying to keep pace
                            with them, or slow down the rate of their advance. Although measures are
                            being taken which will ultimately result in the provision of increased
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces, the time required does
                            not permit reliance upon these measures alone. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider that US land forces should be introduced in a combatant role,
                            in such strengths as to achieve an effective margin of combat power, and
                            provide a clear indication that the United States intends to support
                            SouthVietnam and intends to achieve its objectives. Participation by
                            forces of the Republic of Korea, and of other allies if subsequently
                            offered, would provide valuable force increases in addition to a
                            favorable psychological effect. Outline concepts for force
                            introductions, <pb xml:id="pg_467" n="467" facs="0499"/>including
                            strengths and command arrangements, are set forth in the Annex<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> to this
                            memorandum. The forces thus provided would conduct active operations
                            against the Viet Cong, provide security for important installations,
                            free <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces for offensive
                            operations, and assist in containing infiltration.</p>
                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff therefore recommend that US and allied
                            forces be deployed for combat missions in South Vietnam as indicated
                            (Additional details of concepts and force requirements are in the
                            Annex.)</p>
                        <p>a. Expand mission of Marine elements at Da Nang to include
                            counterinsurgency combat operations. Deploy remainder of the III Marine
                            Expeditionary Force to the Da Nang area as requested by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, with the same mission.</p>
                        <p>b. Deploy, as soon as proper logistic support is ensured, a US Army
                            division with necessary supporting forces from the continental United
                            States for employment in the central plateau, centered on the Pleiku
                            area, for counterinsurgency combat operations.</p>
                        <p>c. Deploy, as soon as practicable, a Republic of Korea Army division
                            force to South Vietnam for counterinsurgency and base security
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>d. Deploy, as requested by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>,
                            four of the nine Air Force squadrons previously recommended in <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–149–65.<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Not found.</note>

                            <item>Your meeting with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Michael Stewart</persName> of Great Britain, Tuesday, March 23,

                        <p>1. <persName>Stewart</persName>'s conversations with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> so far have produced only one
                            serious question—the political problem of the
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> Government in holding to its present
                            support for us in Vietnam. <persName>Dean</persName> is planning to talk
                            some more with the British before <persName>Stewart</persName> comes in,
                            and this memo may be outdated by tomorrow, though I doubt it.</p>
                        <p>2. The British tell us—and <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David
                                Bruce</persName> agrees—that their present position is not tenable
                            without some slight help from us. As <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David
                                Bruce</persName> puts it, the Prime Minister is being strongly
                            criticized, not only by his Left but by his Center. He is accused of
                            uncritical support for a U.S. position about which he is uninformed. It
                            is asserted that he has deserted his principles to curry favor with the
                            President, who in return has allowed it to be known that the Prime
                            Minister will be an unwelcome visitor in April. The cooler men in the
                            Labor Party, as distinct from the Left Wing wild men, are said to be
                            losing their patience.</p>
                        <p>3. All this of course is a wild misstatement of the existing situation.
                            None of it takes account of the very great damage which
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> did to himself by his outrageous phone
                            call to you—a phone call which has never been publicized. But <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> impresses it on me that the
                            existing situation in the Labor Party is real.</p>
                        <p>4. In this situation one course might be to let the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] Labor Party
                            struggle with its own political problems, on the ground that
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> 's troubles are of his own making, not
                            ours. The difficulty with this course is that since
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> prefers his own survival to solidarity
                            with us, he would be mortally tempted to begin to make critical noises
                            about us, thus appealing both to his own party and to the natural
                            nationalism of many independent Englishmen. This would not be helpful to
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> in the long run, but it would not be
                            helpful to us either, as the history of Dienfenbaker proves.
                                (<persName>Wilson</persName> and Diefenbaker have about the same
                            amount of internal sweetness.) When we fall out with Prime Ministers,
                            it's usually painted as our fault.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>5. The alternative is to see what is the least we can offer the British
                            in return for continued solidarity in support of the essentials of our
                            policy in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName>
                            thinks this necessary minimum is simply that we should join them in
                            saying publicly that there is a full and continuous exchange of views
                            and of information at all levels between our two Governments on this
                            important issue. Then we can put on some parsley about how glad we are
                            to have Mr. <persName>Stewart</persName> and how much we look forward to
                            the Prime Minister's visit. In return, the British should undertake not
                            to advocate negotiations and not to go back on their existing announced
                            approval of our present course of action. They should limit themselves
                            to expressions of hope that a path to a peaceful settlement will come,
                            plus expressions of alertness, as Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference,
                            to any opportunities for peaceful settlement which may develop in the
                            future. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> thinks that this
                            position will not be easy for <persName>Wilson</persName> , but that he
                            will find it distinctly preferable to a split with us at this time.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName>David</persName> and I have been up and down this problem
                            for an hour this afternoon, and this is our joint recommendation. I will
                            telephone and ask for your views in the morning, and on the basis of
                            what you tell me, I will then do a one-page paper for your use with
                                <persName>Stewart</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">Not
                                found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and I believe that you can
                            be most candid and effective with him if you see him entirely alone, but
                            the meeting can be of any size that you choose. It need not take more
                            than 20 minutes, and the smaller it is the shorter it can be. Our
                            talking paper will cover the stupid fuss over gas, which should not have
                            occurred, as well as press reports of a far-out statement on “escalation

                        <p>1. The riot-control gases used in Vietnam are standard issue for all U.S.
                            troops with riot-control missions, and authority to use them has been
                            delegated to subordinate commanders for many years.</p>
                        <p>2. These gases are also standard issue under Military Assistance Programs
                            to friendly troops with riot-control missions.</p>
                        <p>3. These gases are non-lethal and their effects are temporary. They are
                            totally different from the poison gases against which international
                            conventions and humanitarian feeling are directed.</p>
                        <p>4. There are three known uses of these riot-control gases in Vietnam (two
                            cases were in efforts by Vietnamese troops to rescue U.S. advisors—this
                            is a good point at home, but not abroad).</p>
                        <p>5. There has been absolutely no <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            discussion of this problem precisely because riot-control gases are
                            standard equipment. There has been no proposal at any time for the use
                            of poison gas in this theater or elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, these gases are precisely analogous to those used by police
                            forces all over the world.</p>

                            would receive the Foreign Secretary alone at 11:30. I rode over to the
                            White House with the two <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Michael
                                Stewart</persName>s. On our side, <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>

                            were present. We waited in the Cabinet Room with the British Minister.
                            Meanwhile, the Foreign Secretary talked to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName>, before being closeted with the President. To
                            our surprise, after about fifteen minutes of this duet, we were all
                            summoned into the oval office, where we were joined by Hadow (Foreign
                            Office Press representative) and <persName>Bundy</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Marvin Watson</persName> wandered in and out,
                            trying to preserve the President's appointments schedule, whilst the
                            British were concerned lest <persName>Stewart</persName> miss his
                            engagement to lunch and speak at the National Press Club. This did not
                            divert <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss>, who was in talkative form.
                            It was great theatre; he fed us oratorical sandwiches, with layers of
                            gravity and levity. At one time, after he had enumerated the variety of
                            criticisms to which he was daily subjected over Vietnam, he remarked
                            “Sometimes I just get all hunkered up like a jackass in a
                            hailstorm.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Stewart</persName> kept reverting to the uproar in Britain
                            over the use of non-lethal gas by the South Vietnamese air force. The
                            cable lines are hot with protests, petitions are pouring forth from
                                <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>'s, Americans are being denounced
                            for resorting to barbarous and horrible weapons. I thought the President
                            dealt well with the attack, explaining that the gas was one in common
                            use by our own police forces, was frequently employed for quelling
                            riots, and was stocked by many countries. The chief trouble, I believe,
                            is that no warning was given in advance from Saigon of its prospective
                            utilization, nor until yesterday, did our top men in Washington seem to
                            know anything about the occurrences. From a public relations viewpoint,
                            the Saigon authorities, and secondarily our own, have behaved
                            idiotically. “Gas” is widely regarded as a dirty word, and everywhere
                                <pb xml:id="pg_472" n="472" facs="0504"/>evokes images of World War
                            I brutalities. The affair is further complicated by the allegation that
                            supplies of this type were left behind by the French army, when they
                            evacuated Indo-China, and that some of it was manufactured in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. We are now explaining that on the
                            occasions it has been used in Vietnam, it was largely ineffective.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> discoursed for more than an hour,
                            explaining his objectives, hopes and fears. He is power sublimated, like
                            Niagara Falls. He read us a long letter<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">Not
                                further identified.</note> from an American soldier in Vietnam to
                            his “Mom”, strongly supporting American policy. I think he impressed his
                            audience by his grasp of the issues involved, and his own mastery over
                            decisions, but must have puzzled the British by the alternations of his
                            manner. He told <persName>Stewart</persName> he had no objections
                            whatever to negotiations if any one could offer a reasonable prospect of
                            their succeeding.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief session for photography; the cameramen made their
                            onslaught in two waves. Then the Foreign Minister was released, after
                            ninety minutes of an experience he is never likely to forget.<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">A formal memorandum of the conversation between the

                        <p>Mac and I stayed behind for a while. The President said that
                                <persName>Stewart</persName> had not offered a single practical or
                            helpful suggestion, nor had General deGaulle, or any other foreigner.
                            Then he repeated what he told <persName>Stewart</persName> about fierce
                            domestic pressures on him. Some favored abandonment of all our
                            commitments in the East, and retreat to Hawaii. Others wanted us to bomb
                            the hell out of China. Others would kill all the civilians, as well as
                            military, in the Hanoi district. He intended to continue to make
                            measured responses to aggression from North Vietnam until it ceased. We
                            had obligated ourselves under three Presidents to assist the South
                            Vietnamese to preserve their liberties, and that commitment would be
                            carried out. He thought it insulting for politicians to come chasing
                            over to see him, to expound for home consumption their condemnatory
                            statements from the White House steps, unless they had practicable
                            solutions to offer for American problems.</p>

                            topics under Vietnam: the gas problem, the diplomatic program, Rolling

                        <p>3070. For the President. This has been a pleasantly quiet week both in a
                            military and in a political sense. Viet Cong units country-wide appeared
                            to be avoiding contact with government forces as their activity dropped
                            to the lowest level since the lunar new year (early February). There
                            were no large-scale Viet Cong attacks and only two district towns were
                            fired on during the week. For the first time in my memory, during the
                            last week all three of the principal indicators of military activity,
                            killed in action, prisoners captured and weapons lost to the enemy have
                            been favorable to the government.</p>
                        <p>Evidence of arms infiltration from Hanoi increased in this period. Thanks
                            in one case to information given by a Viet Cong defector and in another
                            case to timely intelligence, arms caches were uncovered in the Vung Ro
                            area near the bay where the arms ship was found last month, and in a
                            motorized wooden vessel carrying quantities of arms sunk by government
                            forces at a point off <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Quang
                            Tri</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Government operations were maintained at a high level, although contacts
                            with the enemy were fewer than the week before. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> B-57's attacked Viet Cong targets every day of the
                            week with evidence of favorable results.</p>
                        <p>The pacification indicators also took a favorable turn. In II Corps area,
                            there was a marked decrease in the number of Viet Cong incidents,
                            attributable in part to U.S. and Vietnamese air operations. In Binh Dinh
                            Province, visible progress was made in caring for the refugees. Work has
                            started on eleven new refugee centers and the province chief has
                            recruited several hundred refugees for the regional and popular forces.
                            The units formed from these recruits will accompany the refugees when
                            they are able to return to their villages or are resettled in new
                            locations. Pacification progress elsewhere in South Vietnam was as
                            uneven as usual.</p>

                            continued to exhibit understanding of the importance of building up his
                            public image. During the early part of the week, he spent a good deal of
                            time meeting with and entertaining the provincial officials convened in
                            Saigon for a “National Administrative <pb xml:id="pg_476" n="476" facs="0508"/>Congress.” While it is too early to assess the results
                            of the Congress, it provided a unique opportunity for each province to
                            air its problems and hopes before responsible Saigon authorities and
                            thus to reestablish badly needed communication between Saigon and the
                            provincial administrations. Also, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is spending two days in central Vietnam this week
                            on a personal inspection of the refugee situation there and establishing
                            political contact in Hue and Danang, the traditional center of political
                            turbulence in South Vietnam. I expect to join him in Danang

                        <p>The Armed Forces Council met over the weekend to consider changes in the
                            high command. Although <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> has
                            told me that no decisions have been taken, the press and our informants
                            have it that the Council confirmed General <persName corresp="#p_MLM1">“Little” Minh</persName> as commander-in-chief (he holds this post
                            now on an “acting” basis), selected General <persName corresp="#p_HVC1">Huynh Van Cao</persName> as Chief of the Joint General Staff and is
                            about to recommend several other changes. If these appointments
                            materialize, they place Catholic generals in the three top military
                            positions (the third being General <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> , Deputy Prime Minister and Armed Forces
                            Minister). This could stimulate a reaction from the Buddhist Institute,
                            and we have reports that the Armed Forces Council have sent
                            representatives to discuss the matter with Institute leaders. Except for
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAO1">Cao</persName> whose ability to fill the
                            job of chief of staff is questionable, we would take no issue with the
                            reported changes.</p>
                        <p>Despite the apparently improved Catholic position within the military
                            establishment, we have begun to receive some indications that the
                            militant northern refugee Catholics are becoming more and more restless
                            at what they consider to be the growing alliance between the Buddhist
                            Institute and Generals <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>, I Corps and Air Force
                            commanders respectively. We will take more soundings among these
                            Catholic groups in order to monitor their feelings and intentions as
                            closely as we can.</p>
                        <p>If the Catholics are getting increasingly restless, it is perhaps
                            understandable that the Buddhist Institute continues to be relatively
                            tranquil. The Institute had a national conference last week and, as far
                            as we can determine from talking to key leaders, they agreed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName> should cease his
                            involvement in the peace movement he initiated (although <persName corresp="#p_QL1">Quang Lien</persName> reportedly believes the
                            conference did not take such a hard and fast decision). Institute
                            leaders also decided that they should concentrate on internal Buddhist
                            organizational and program matters, avoiding politics unless “directly
                            threatened.” They seem reasonably <pb xml:id="pg_477" n="477" facs="0509"/>satisfied with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> for the time being and may be willing to stick to
                            propagating the dharma. Time will tell.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to seeing you soon and going over the situation which has
                            shifted significantly since I was home in December.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Over the years, I have submitted both to your predecessor and to you a
                            series of memorandums on the situation in Viet Nam and Southeast
                                Asia.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">For earlier memoranda from
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> to President

                                    IV</ref>, pp. 691–692; and <ref target="frus1961-63v01#d2">vol. I,
                                    Document 2</ref>.</note> Sometimes suggestions have been
                            requested of me and sometimes they have been volunteered. In either
                            case, they have been motivated solely by a desire to give such help as I
                            might in the burdens of the decisions of the Presidency.</p>
                        <p>The main lines of thought in these memorandums over the years, as you may
                            recall, are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. That the United States does not have interests on the Southeast Asian
                            mainland to justify the costs in American lives and resources which
                            would be required if we were to attempt to exercise, in effect, primacy
                            over what transpires in that region; and that, insofar as South Viet Nam
                            is concerned, we are there, not to take primary responsibility, but to
                            provide whatever assistance is wanted and can be used effectively by the
                            Vietnamese themselves.</p>
                        <p>2. That our national interest lies in reducing, rather than in
                            increasing, the unilateral role which we have played in recent years,
                            through the foreign aid program and excessive involvement of various
                            United States agencies in the internal affairs of the weak nations of
                            that region.</p>
                        <p>3. That our national security interests are best served in Southeast Asia
                            by severely limiting our military involvement and, confining ourselves
                            at most, to a very judicious use of air and sea power.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_478" n="478" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>4. That the best prospects for a tolerable long-range situation in
                            Southeast Asia lie in encouraging, through astute diplomacy and limited
                            and preferably multilateral economic assistance, the emergence of truly
                            independent governments with firm roots in their own people, which are
                            as free as possible from great power involvement in their internal
                            affairs. This situation, as I have noted, time and again, has prevailed
                            in Cambodia at least until very recently when, in my judgment, a
                            combination of years of inept diplomacy and the events in Viet Nam
                            finally conspired to push this small and ably-led nation sharply towards
                            China. It has prevailed to some extent in Burma and at one time, there
                            was hope for it in South Viet Nam under the late <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that the principles of policy outlined in the four points
                            above are subject to the charge of “a return to isolationism.” It should
                            be noted, however, that there is no automatic virtue in an ubiquitous
                            and indiscriminate internationalism, particularly when it leads to the
                            kind of isolated internationalism in which we presently find ourselves
                            in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>I think it is correct to say that the trend of our policies over the past
                            few years has been in a direction opposite to the main lines of thought
                            which are contained in my memorandums over the past few years. I say
                            this, as you know, without rancor or criticism. I know that my thoughts
                            have received your careful attention. I know that your assistants and
                            the bureaucracy have studied them and occasionally even have concurred
                            in an idea expressed in them.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is still a fact that present policy is on a course which
                            contains the following diametric opposites of the suggestions which I
                            have advanced over the years. Present policy, so far as I can determine,
                            requires:</p>
                        <p>(1) That we make whatever expenditure of American lives and resources, on
                            an ascending scale, is necessary in order for us to exercise, in effect,
                            a primacy over what transpires in South Viet Nam. If this involves going
                            into North Viet Nam and beyond, that, too, will be done.</p>
                        <p>(2) That in the absence of unconditional capitulation of the Viet Cong,
                            our military involvement must continue and be increased as necessary
                            (there is discussion even now of a Joint Command which can only be the
                            prelude to United States command in fact if not in word).</p>
                        <p>(3) That our military involvement will not be restricted to a most
                            judicious use of air and sea power, as evidenced by instructions to
                            strike at “targets of convenience”, but rather that it be extended, even
                            to the infusion of a steadily increasing number of American combat
                            forces on the ground.</p>
                        <p>(4) That we will not try to encourage, through sustained diplomatic
                            efforts, the emergence of the kind of situations which exist in Burma
                            and Cambodia, but rather, so far as I can see, that we will stress those
                            situations <pb xml:id="pg_479" n="479" facs="0511"/>which can be
                            maintained only by continuous infusions of American aid (i.e., Laos and
                            Thailand, not to speak of South Viet Nam itself).</p>
                        <p>Those are the facts of our policy as it is being carried out, as I see
                            it. It is possible that this direction may not be precisely the one you
                            seek, a possibility suggested by your calling to my attention this
                            morning your unawareness in advance of the usage of gas in Viet
                                Nam.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> phoned <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> at 9:12 a.m. on March 24.
                                    (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library, President's Daily
                                Diary)</note> It may be that you were also unaware in advance,
                            understandably, of the usage of napalm and of the concept of “targets of
                            convenience” which are likely to do at least as much damage to
                            non-combatants as combatants in a situation such as Viet Nam or the
                            countless other decisions which deepen our involvement and
                            responsibility. May I say in connection with the gas that it is beyond
                            my comprehension how any American in an office of responsibility would
                            not realize the vast significance, beyond immediate military
                            considerations, of this act and, therefore, seek the highest political
                            authority before taking such a step.</p>
                        <p>It is this possibility, that actions of the bureaucracy may have taken us
                            in more deeply than desired, which leads me to write you once again, and
                            most respectfully suggest certain changes at this time which may move us
                            from the present direction of policy as it is expressed in action. In
                            all frankness, I believe that the present direction is at variance with
                            the extent and nature of our national interests on the Southeast Asian
                            mainland and in the world. In the end, I fear that this course, at best,
                            will win us only more widespread difficulties which will play havoc with
                            the domestic program of the Administration, with the balance of payments
                            situation, and with our interests and constructive influence elsewhere
                            in the world.</p>
                        <p>I have no great hope that, at this late date, these suggestions will be
                            useful to you. But for what they may be worth, I would suggest:</p>
                        <p>1. That we should concentrate any ground forces which are sent to Viet
                            Nam to safeguard Americans already there in two or three key spots which
                            either back up on the sea or are easily accessible from the sea (i.e.,
                            Saigon and Da Nang) and that all other Americans in Viet Nam should be
                            drawn into these protected points as rapidly as possible. From the point
                            of view of our diplomatic position, two or three accessible and more
                            defensible bases will be of greater value than numerous installations in
                            the interior which can become, one by one, the targets of massed Viet
                            Cong attacks;</p>
                        <p>2. That we should seek, indirectly but forcefully, through all possible
                            sources, a reconvening of the 1961 Geneva Conference group;</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_480" n="480" facs="0512"/>
                        <p>3. That we should insist upon, as the sole precondition for such a
                            meeting, a total cease-fire and stand-fast throughout all of Viet Nam,
                            north and south.</p>
                        <p>4. That we should be prepared for consultation between the Saigon
                            government, the North Vietnamese and the opposition in the south on the
                            conditions for maintaining the “cease-fire” and “stand-fast,” and on
                            subsequent relationships once a conference has been convened and,
                            further, that we accept, if circumstances indicate the desirability of
                            it, United Nations participation in this connection.</p>
                        <p>As you well know, it is very difficult to predict the evolution of a
                            course of policy once it has been set in motion. There will be risks to
                            our national interests in a conference, but certainly, in my opinion,
                            risks which are far smaller than those which we now run. I think it
                            should be pointed out that if there is a settlement it is possible that
                            Chinese influence in Southeast Asia may increase, but that possibility
                            is even greater if the present course is pursued further. A settlement
                            would not necessarily mean, however, that China will automatically
                            control the area in a military or even an economic sense. The historic
                            counterforce to that domination is the general Southeast Asian fear and
                            anxiety of the Chinese which is quite distinct and may be at least as
                            strong as ideology. In present circumstances, this fear and anxiety
                            would appear to be largely dormant but it could revive in the event of a
                            Chinese attempt at subversion of subjugation, particularly after a
                            settlement. The existing Sino-Soviet dispute is also likely to distract
                            China from Southeast Asia to some degree, but not in the event of a
                            deepening military confrontation in that area.</p>
                        <p>I have written frankly and at length out of a deep concern over the
                            present trend of events in Viet Nam. We are in very deep already and in
                            most unfavorable circumstances. In my judgment we were in too deep long
                            before you assumed office. But you know the whole situation on a
                            day-to-day basis and I most certainly respect the decisions which you
                            have felt compelled to make in this connection.</p>
                        <p>I shall not trouble you further with memorandums on this situation and I
                            do not expect an answer to this letter.<note n="4" xml:id="d215fn4">For

                        <p>Immediately following his meeting with the President on March 23 (see
                                <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>), Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Stewart</persName> spoke at the National Press Club
                            and criticized the reported use by the United States of gas warfare in
                            Vietnam. No text of his remarks has been found, but a summary appeared
                            in <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>, March 24, 1965, p. A2. On

                            telephoned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, who
                            was still in Washington, and asked him to prepare a draft letter to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> “expressing
                            the President's indignation over <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Michael

                            coupling British objections to the use of gas with a quotation about the
                            ‘decent observance of the opinions of mankind.’” When <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> met with the President at 1 p.m.
                            March 24, the President decided not to send a rebuke to
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> , a decision that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> welcomed since he considered it
                            “undignified and unnecessary” to do so. (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327,

                            meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> , all except Tupper and Mathias agreed to say no

                            the President. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In view of the heated controversy over the reported gas warfare, the
                            President decided that Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> should issue a clarifying <pb xml:id="pg_482" n="482" facs="0514"/>statement at a press conference on March 24.
                            That morning U.S. Information Agency Director <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> called the Secretary of State. A memorandum of
                            their conversation reads:</p>
                        <p>“R said he had talked to the President about gas business and he asked R
                            to talk to Sec before his noon statement; R felt we had to say that we
                            were willing not to engage in military use of gas; and were we willing
                            to say this. Sec said in gas warfare, but Sec was not willing to make a
                            flat commitment that closes the door in the future. R said he felt the
                            word tactical use was causing us trouble. Sec asked if R saw the second
                            thoughts of the British newspapers. Sec told R what he was going to say.
                            R said we are absolutely unsuccessful in selling something that goes
                            under the name of gas; we have a significant eroding away of third
                            country support for this effort; R told of Japanese reaction. Sec said
                            he did not think he should say guilty but we will not do it again; we
                            should not be in the dock like a criminal.” (Department of State,

                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> summarized the Vietnam
                            situation including reactions abroad to U.S. air strikes on North
                            Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>a. In South Vietnam, the U.S. attacks greatly improved military morale
                            and stabilized the government situation in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>b. Hanoi stated its determination to stand up to the air attacks. It has
                            given no hint that it is ready to accept negotiations.</p>
                        <p>c. Communist China urged Hanoi to stand firm. Peking continues to provide
                            military assistance to Hanoi. The Chinese Communists are not yet ready
                            to get into the fight.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_483" n="483" facs="0515"/>
                        <p>d. The Soviets have no choice but to support Hanoi. The Vietnam war has
                            the effect of intensifying the Sino-Soviet split.</p>
                        <p>The intelligence community estimates that Hanoi remains unconvinced that
                            they cannot win out militarily. They are not yet ready to negotiate.
                            Sustained U.S. air attacks on North Vietnam may prompt Hanoi to offer
                            negotiations on the condition that the air attacks are called off. The
                            State intelligence representative thinks that the Chinese Communists
                            will respond by sending combat troops before Hanoi reaches the point of
                            being forced to accept negotiations. The rest of the intelligence
                            community believes that the Chinese Communists will probably not attack
                            U.S. planes or ships or send in their ground army.</p>
                        <p>There is no hard evidence that the Chinese Communists are blocking Soviet
                            efforts to send aid to North Vietnam. There are some indications that
                            this is being done, such as the refusal of overflight clearances for
                            Soviet planes flying materiel to North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Soviet Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called at his
                            request at noon.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> —<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said:</p>
                        <p>a. The Soviets cannot disassociate themselves from the fate of a
                            socialist country such as North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>b. The Soviets are giving assistance to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>c. The Soviets warned us in advance that we were following a dangerous
                            path in escalating the war in Vietnam. We are jeopardizing US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relations. The U.S. has assumed a
                            grave responsibility by continuing its aggression against the North
                            Vietnamese Government. The United States should withdraw its forces from
                            all of Vietnam and strictly observe the Geneva Agreement of 1954.</p>
                        <p>d. The U.S. continues its bombing of Laos and has opposed the holding of
                            a conference on Laos.</p>
                        <p>e. U.S. actions in Vietnam—as well as support of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—create a poor atmosphere for
                            disarmament talks.</p>
                        <p>f. The United States has underestimated the serious effect of the current
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It is a pity that
                            the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are being dragged
                            along by North Vietnam. There is a difference between one country
                            attacking another and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            supporting another socialist country. The Soviets are paralyzed by U.S.
                            bombing and, as long as it continues, they cannot take any political
                            action without exposing themselves to the criticism that they are not
                            defending a socialist country. We do not know what they will do,
                            however, if the bombing is stopped.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the U.S. air strikes was serious, but the attacks have not
                            created a crisis. Our aim is to get Hanoi to realize that the North
                            Vietnamese cannot win over South Vietnam without danger of our
                            escalating the war.</p>

                            discussion of fresh efforts to be made in Vietnam. Recently, the South
                            Vietnamese Foreign Minister said publicly that a separate North and
                            South Vietnam is acceptable to Saigon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>: The world press is still critical
                            of our alleged use of gas in Vietnam but there has been some
                            turn-around. No explanation of the facts, i.e., that the gas was the
                            type used to control riots, will do much good because of the worldwide
                            emotional reaction to the word “gas”.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> refused to accept and
                            sent back to the Soviet Foreign Ministry the Soviet note on what they
                            described as gas warfare in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Since
                            February 9, there have been 19 U.S. air raids in North Vietnam, 13 of
                            these in the last week. The strikes were moderately successful from a
                            military point of view. The North Vietnamese radar is very hard to
                            destroy. Of the planes attacking North Vietnam, 80 percent are U.S. and
                            20 percent are South Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>We now have 28,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> are asking for 10,000
                            more.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong activity dropped off this week and has been lower than normal
                            since February 9. We estimate that the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese forces
                            in South Vietnam total 40,000 regular troops plus 100,000 irregulars. We
                            are planning to increase the ratio of free world troops to that of the
                            Viet Cong/North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>U.S. casualties have increased and the level of fatalities is high.</p>

                            points is being implemented. More U.S. aircraft are being shipped. The
                            proposal to introduce U.S. combat troops will be looked at when General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> arrives here next
                            week. An extensive logistics program is being implemented, in addition
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>'s program. A
                            second action program is being drawn up.</p>
                        <p>The President:<note n="4" xml:id="d217fn4">According to <persName corresp="#p_HRN1">Helms</persName>' record of the meeting, at
                                this point the President “asked to have General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>'s twenty-one points sent
                                back to him with a statement beside each one as to the action
                                taken.”</note> Dates should be put behind each program. Next week
                            the Joint Chiefs should meet with me to discuss their new military

                        <p>It is unlikely that present political actions will meet the situation. We
                            should plan for a bigger political effort to reverse the current trend.
                            New political actions should be proposed for consideration.<note n="5" xml:id="d217fn5">According to <persName corresp="#p_HRN1">Helms</persName>' record of the meeting, the President “asked
                                the Department of State to get to work on this and submit proposals
                                to him as soon as possible.”</note>

                        <p>An overall policy speech on Vietnam should be prepared. We should enlist
                            new brain power in drafting the things which need to be said. One grows
                            tired of reading only what the other side is saying. We should crank up
                            our propaganda effort. Last week we did reasonably well to overcome the
                            adverse reaction to our use of riot control gas.</p>
                        <p>A stabilizing effect on the press resulted from statements which were put
                            out concerning our not talking about our military actions. We should
                            quietly make clear the huge amount of time which we spend defending
                            ourselves from our domestic opponents. More time should be spent on new
                            initiatives. Perhaps we should have two Councils—one defensive and one
                            offensive. New initiatives are required. We can only be pleased that the
                            current Vietnam government hasn't fallen.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>: The public information
                            situation was bad two years ago but improved when we increased our
                            military activity. We now have new problems with over 200 reporters
                            based in Saigon. New press guidelines are being sent to Saigon. New
                            press criticism is increasing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> raised the question
                            of briefing Senators. They should be briefed as soon as we have
                            something new to say. The Senators are getting nervous. Weekly briefings
                            in executive sessions of the appropriate Senate committees should be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>The President: We must think out this problem. We are spending most of
                            our time defending our actions in Vietnam. What about the Stennis <pb xml:id="pg_486" n="486" facs="0518"/>report on no equipment

                            Should not this report have gone first to the President and then to the
                            press? Senators other than those on the Foreign Relations and the Armed
                            Services Committees should be called on and given briefings. Separate
                            gatherings should be arranged which would be addressed by only Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. All questions raised at
                            these sessions should be answered. We should then offer to go up to the
                            Hill to testify on Vietnam every two weeks.</p>

                            requirements for US military manpower in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The authorized US military strength in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is presently about 28,000. As
                            individuals or as members of units, these men are providing the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> with advice, air support, and
                            logistic support or are reinforcing the security of selected military
                            installations. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is recommending a
                            further increase of about 18,000 US personnel to round out table of
                            organization shortages, to improve local security at US billets and
                            installations, to provide better air and communications support, and to
                            create a much needed logistics command. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> is recommending the introduction of
                            the remainder of the 9th <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss> to give
                            greater strength to the security forces of the Danang-Phu Bai area. If
                            all of these recommendations are approved, we are headed for a US
                            military strength in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> of
                            approximately 50,000.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these mounting requirements, there is a more significant
                            one taking form which is discussed in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 3003. It is quite clear that the existing
                            operational units of the armed forces of Vietnam are insufficient to
                            cope effectively with the internal Viet Cong threat. In <pb xml:id="pg_487" n="487" facs="0519"/>recent weeks, we have seen a
                            serious deterioration in the I and II Corps which has required the
                            transfer of most of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> general
                            reserve units to that area. Although there is an intensified build-up of
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces in process, the full
                            effect of this expanded mobilization will not be felt in terms of
                            available operational units until toward the end of calendar 1965. Thus,
                            we are faced with an immediate shortage of trained military and
                            paramilitary units to offset the mounting strength of the Viet Cong. The
                            basic question is whether we can accept this manpower shortage over the
                            coming months and await the readiness of the new <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units, or whether some way must be
                            found at once to compensate for the shortage during the intervening
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Before attempting to answer this question, it is first necessary to
                            decide what kind of strategy should be pursued during calendar year
                            1965. Strategy A might be to accept the present unsatisfactory progress
                            in defeating the Viet Cong and base our hopes on the effect of the
                            pressure of the current air attacks on Hanoi. Even if we make little
                            progress in pacification during the coming months or even accept further
                            retardation, this delay will be inconsequential if, in the end, Hanoi
                            throws in the sponge and agrees to cease aid to the Viet Cong and to
                            cooperate in their liquidation.</p>
                        <p>Strategy B might be to take the position that it is essential to reverse
                            the downward trend in certain critical provinces, not only to avoid the
                            danger of a debacle in these areas but also, through in-country
                            successes, to give added weight to the effectiveness of the air campaign
                            on the will of Hanoi. If the latter is losing both in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and suffering from repeated air attacks
                            in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, this condition should accelerate
                            the decision of the North Vietnamese leaders to mend their ways.</p>
                        <p>Strategy C might be to take the position that we must do everything
                            possible to speed up the in-country campaign against the Viet Cong to
                            prevent a possible collapse of national morale and to shorten the period
                            of international tension which will exist throughout the duration of our
                            military pressures on Hanoi. This means go for broke to win rapidly. To
                            accept such a strategy is to support the need for the injection of all
                            possible military strength into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            which can be supported and be used effectively.</p>
                        <p>Without choosing between these three strategies at this point, let us
                            assume that we are headed along the course of either Strategy B or C.
                            Furthermore, let us make the assumption which I believe is correct that
                            no introduction of US forces less than about 9–12 battalions will have
                            any significant effect on the military situation in this country in the
                            short term. So the immediate question is how to employ such a force if
                            the decision is taken to introduce it.</p>
                        <p>In extension of the discussion on the same subject in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 3003, I would say that such a US
                            force could be used in three ways: (1) in a defensive <pb xml:id="pg_488" n="488" facs="0520"/>or offensive enclave, (2) in
                            territorial clear-and-hold operations or (3) as mobile reaction
                            reserves. The defensive enclave is typified by the present employment of
                            the two battalions of Marines in defense of the Danang airbase. They
                            secure the immediate airbase but do not engage in military operations
                            outside the defensive perimeter. This disposition could be changed into
                            an offensive enclave if the Marines were allowed to sally forth and
                            engage in operations either initiated by themselves or in support of
                            operations conducted by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. In any
                            case, they would remain responsible for the security of Danang.</p>
                        <p>The use of US forces in territorial clear-and-hold operations amounts to
                            giving them a mobile offensive role similar to that of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> regular units. The plateau region in
                            west central Vietnam has often been cited as a suitable region for this
                            kind of employment. The advantages of this region and this mission are
                            discussed in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 3003.</p>
                        <p>The mobile reaction use amounts to assigning a mission to the US forces
                            tantamount to that of the general reserve battalions of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. Under this concept, the US forces
                            would not go forth to find and fix the enemy but would wait until <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> had found and fixed him, then as a
                            striking force in reserve, they would enter action to finish the enemy
                            who had been previously fixed by indigenous forces.</p>
                        <p>These three modes of employment all have their pros and cons. The enclave
                            concept assures the security of an important installation or
                            installations with minimum exposure of US personnel to casualties. It
                            places our forces in locations on or near the coast where egress and
                            ingress are easy to assure. However, if only a passive defensive role is
                            assigned to them, they will have little effect upon the war against the
                            Viet Cong and little influence in relieving <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces for employment elsewhere. If the enclave is
                            used offensively, the latter objection does not apply but, on the other
                            hand, the exposure of US personnel to losses is increased.</p>
                        <p>The territorial clear-and-hold mission could have a significant effect in
                            assisting the campaign against the Viet Cong—if successfully
                            implemented. However, it runs into all of the longstanding objections to
                            the use of US forces in anti-guerrilla operations in <gloss target="#t_SE1">SE</gloss> Asia. Our forces would inevitably suffer
                            serious losses and at the outset would probably not do too well in
                            operations in strange terrain for which they have not been specifically
                            and intensively trained. There would be the inevitable problems of the
                            identification of the enemy and of command relations with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and with the pacification
                            representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ministries.
                            There would be many legal questions raised relating to detention and
                            arrest of Vietnamese citizens and to use and damage of Vietnamese
                            property. There would be the difficulty of acquiring intelligence in a
                            country where both the language and the environment are unfamiliar. Our
                            forces would be operating under conditions in which the avoidance <pb xml:id="pg_489" n="489" facs="0521"/>of ambush has never been solved
                            by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces operating for years in
                            this environment; hence we would have to assume that the newly arrived
                            US forces would have even greater difficulties in finding and fixing the
                            enemy and in protecting themselves against surprise.</p>
                        <p>The use of our forces in a mobile reaction role has many advantages. To
                            some extent, it minimizes the problem of finding and fixing the enemy.
                            It assures that their employment would be in the climax of an important
                            engagement where a significant element of the enemy could be destroyed.
                            It would allow our forces to have their permanent stations more or less
                            isolated from contacts with the local population in coastal areas easily
                            supplied and supported by air and sea. In such locations, they would
                            also avoid involvement [in] pacification operations which can only be
                            carried out by representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. With air mobility, the employment in central reserve
                            would allow the use of US forces over wide areas of the country and
                            would assure a maximum return from the commitment of our manpower. This
                            mode of employment would also give <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            an additional lever to influence tactical operations since the
                            employment of our battalions could be made conditional upon the
                            concurrence of the US advisors in the tactical plans of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> commanders.</p>
                        <p>There are no particular disadvantages to the mobile reaction concept
                            except the hard fact that we will take losses whenever our troops are
                            plunged into the midst of an engagement in progress. Also they will
                            necessarily be closely associated in action with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and hence will have to work out
                            appropriate command relationships for each operation.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that there is nothing incompatible between a
                            combination of the first and third concepts, that is, of placing US
                            units in mobile reserve for reaction which would operate out of
                            offensive enclaves. One could establish perhaps three such enclaves on
                            or near the coast, each garrisoned by a brigade of three battalions.
                            Under normal conditions, at least two of these battalions could be used
                            on reaction operations leaving the third on the security mission. If the
                            third battalion were required outside the enclave, it would be possible
                            to reinforce the enclave either from another enclave or from a Marine or
                            airborne unit brought in from the Fleet or from Okinawa. A first step
                            toward effecting this disposition could be to organize the Marines in
                            the Danang area into the first of these offensive enclaves. Thereafter,
                            we could bring two Army brigades into areas such as Qui Nhon, Nha Trang
                            and Vung Tau-Bien Hoa. This could be an initial disposition capable of
                            expansion after acquiring experience and gaining evidence as to the
                            effectiveness of US forces in this new role. This conservative beginning
                            would give us insight into the political and psychological effect of US
                            combat participation on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, on the
                            armed forces of Vietnam and on the people.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_490" n="490" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>With regard to the popular reaction, it is far from clear what the
                            attitude of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the Vietnamese
                            people would be toward the introduction of these forces. It could be
                            that Vietnamese morale would be raised and their will to fight enhanced
                            by the presence of US forces and their participation in combat on the
                            ground. It is equally possible that the presence of these additional
                            Americans would tend to sap the already flaccid purpose of the
                            Vietnamese and would promote an attitude of “let the US do it”. In any
                            case, before introducing further US reinforcements into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> it is essential to be sure that they
                            will be enthusiastically welcomed by the government, by the armed forces
                            and by the people.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we need an answer to the following questions before proceeding
                            farther. (A) What strategy does the US propose to follow calendar year
                            1965? (B) To carry out that strategy, is it necessary to bring in
                            additional US ground forces? (C) What will be the reaction of the
                            Government and people of Vietnam to this proposal? If the answers to
                            these proposals support the introduction of additional US ground forces,
                            I would then favor their employment, initially at least, in accordance
                            with the offensive enclave-mobile reaction concept.</p>

                            thought it would be useful for you to have a preliminary indication of
                            the major issues and the positions that have been recommended to the
                            Ambassador by the Mission elements.</p>
                        <p>1. Need for US Forces. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has not
                            included third country forces, such as a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division, in its analysis. It has prepared a detailed

                            introduction of a US division and the filling out of the Marine units,
                            for a total of approximately 33,000 combat personnel. I am not clear
                            whether this includes all the supporting and logistics personnel
                            incident to this additional deployment.</p>
                        <p>This combat deployment would be over and above recommended increases of
                            approximately 18,000 in assorted units and logistics personnel separate
                            from the combat deployment. The 18,000 figure breaks down into
                            approximately 6,000 of increments to existing units, and 12,000 of new
                            units, with the main element in the latter about 7,000 for the
                            “logistics command.”</p>

                            papers on this subject, which we will have copied and distributed
                            Monday. They focus on much the same issues that we are touching on in
                            the present draft pronouncement,<note n="6" xml:id="d219fn6">Presumably

                            The Embassy staff is recommending an increase in tempo, including
                            additional strikes above the 20th parallel. They are also recommending
                            immediate introduction of a leaflet operation as part of the
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The Mission has also supplied useful papers on the question of blockade
                            or aerial mining of the ports. The staff conclusion is that these steps
                            should be further studied, but not carried out for the time being.</p>

                            informal memorandum of conversation is transmitted for your information.
                            It has not been cleared by all participants. No action should be taken
                            on decision items until confirmed through normal channels:</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> met with the
                            Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff 29 March. After a
                            general review of the military, political and pacification situation the
                            discussion turned to: additional US and 3rd country force deployments
                            and missions; Rolling Thunder targeting and reconnaissance; aerial
                            mining and finally Popular Force equipment and funding.</p>
                        <p>2. Force deployments and missions:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has recommended to the
                            Secretary of Defense the early deployment of a three division force with
                            appropriate combat and logistic support. This force would include the
                            entire MEF and I Corps area. An Army Division in the high plateau, and a
                            Korean Division, location <pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493" facs="0525"/>unspecified. The Chairman, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            emphasized the urgent necessity to deploy a logistical command and the
                            forward deployment of tactical fighter squadrons as well as the earliest
                            possible construction of the airfield at Chu Lai and a runway at Da
                            Nang.</p>
                        <p>b. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> indicated
                            that 3 divisions seemed high; that <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> was not persuaded that more troops were necessary;
                            that anti-American sentiment lies just under the surface and that
                            finally there are two very real limitations on the number and rate of
                            introduction of US or 3rd country forces. First is the absorptive
                            capacity of the country and second logistical limitations.</p>
                        <p>c. The Chairman, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> outlined the
                            importance of establishing a goal against which logistics planning could
                            proceed.</p>
                        <p>d. The Secretary of Defense indicated that further US deployments must be
                            accompanied by deployment of Koreans for reasons of domestic
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>e. After an exchange of views on the missions and operating methods of US
                            forces the Secretary of Defense stated that he was impressed with the
                            adverse force ratios and favored deployment of US forces conditioned
                            by:</p>
                        <p>(1) political (psychological) absorption capacity</p>
                        <p>(2) logistical absorption capacity</p>
                        <p>(3) operational absorption—(that is operational requirements).</p>
                        <p>f. For consideration later in the week <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are laying out
                            the various force increases, force ratio implications, and deployment
                            schedules.</p>
                        <p>3. Rolling Thunder</p>
                        <p>a. Strikes against lines of communication will be stepped up starting
                            next week including the Thanh Hoa bridge. Subsequently and in due course
                            the rail lines leading northeast and northwest of Hanoi will be struck.
                            The limitations now being considered are to avoid the Haiphong area and
                            the GCI range of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s around Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>b. The necessity for low level recce is recognized. A policy statement
                            (formula) is being drafted to provide within over-all sortie limitations
                            unescorted low level recce as required anywhere in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> as long as it serves the purpose of
                            building up a bank of required targeting information. The Haiphong area
                            and <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> range of Hanoi would be
                            excluded.</p>
                        <p>4. It was agreed to reexamine the question of aerial mining of the port
                            of Haiphong as a more effective, less expensive equivalent of blockade.
                            It was thought that this action might become necessary in the period 4
                            to 12 weeks out ahead.</p>
                        <p>5. Lastly Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            pointed up some equipment problems associated with the Popular Forces.
                            At a cost of $28 per man a poncho, blanket, mosquito bar and ruck sack
                            could be provided. The <pb xml:id="pg_494" n="494" facs="0526"/>Secretary of Defense directed immediate funding for up to 200,000
                            Popular Forces.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Following the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting last
                                Friday,<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document
                                    217</ref>.</note> you asked me for recommendations of any
                            additional actions that might be taken in South Vietnam <pb xml:id="pg_495" n="495" facs="0527"/>to improve the prospects of
                            accomplishing United States purposes and objectives in that country.
                            Attached is a list of 12 actions which can be taken and which I believe
                            will help. All are designed to improve the viability of the government,
                            to promote cohesion within the South Vietnamese military structure, and
                            to encourage South Vietnamese people to support their government and to
                            participate more actively in the defense of their country.</p>
                        <p>Some of the proposed actions are not dissimilar to current undertakings
                            of the U.S. Mission. However it is my belief that additional effort in
                            the proposed areas, performed by men who have had long backgrounds of
                            experience in South Vietnam, would be very useful.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Outlined below are twelve key points that we believe should be
                            intensified or initiated in the general field of covert political
                            action. Some of these actions are covert in the traditional sense of
                            secrecy and non-attributable sponsorship. Others are on the overt side,
                            but are properly undertaken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            because of our flexibility and capability to move into situations
                            quickly, bypassing cumbersome governmental mechanisms on both the U.S.
                            and South Vietnamese sides. All of these actions are, of course,
                            essentially complementary to the large, overt activities of the U.S.
                            mission in its large-scale collaboration with the South Vietnamese
                            government. Based on our experience in Vietnam, however, we believe that
                            the listed actions should and could be undertaken by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> with proper <pb xml:id="pg_496" n="496" facs="0528"/>approval and authority. We realize that the obstacles
                            to success are substantial, but feel that the effort should be made, and
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>1. Extension of covert support to key Buddhist leaders, especially in the
                            social, cultural and anti-communist political fields. Both Buddhist lay
                            and religious leaders have requested help in the organization and
                            training of cadre to work in the countryside on various anti-communist
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>2. Covert subsidy of a political party in support of <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>. The training and placement of
                            political organizers to evoke positive popular reactions to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s programs could contribute to
                            the stability of his government.</p>
                        <p>3. Expansion of covert contacts at all levels of the military structure
                            to influence them toward cohesion and collaboration with the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government. Considerable personal
                            and non-official involvement with these personalities is necessary to
                            provide a means through which advice, encouragement and admonition can
                            be proffered on a non-official level.</p>
                        <p>4. Provision of covert support to the development of free labor unions to
                            conduct social, civic and political action throughout the country at the
                            provincial level. Through judicious subsidy of labor activities,
                            organization of specific anti-Viet Cong labor projects and exhortation
                            to protect the gains of free labor, this politically inert group could
                            possibly develop into a significant anti-Viet Cong force.</p>
                        <p>5. Covert support and stimulation of non-governmental farmers
                            cooperatives and agricultural extension organizations. Cooperative
                            purchase and use of farm tools and fertilizers, cooperative harvesting
                            and marketing, and increased knowledge and training in means to expand
                            agricultural production would provide for many farmers a good reason to
                            resist communist appeals.</p>
                        <p>6. Covert support to non-governmental responsible youth and student
                            leaders and organizations. Emerging moderate student and youth
                            leadership should be supported and encouraged, both financially and
                            through training and participation in international youth activities, to
                            provide an outlet and a channel for youth and student energy and
                            expression.</p>
                        <p>7. Expansion of current political action and similar teams working in
                            disputed areas. Some 3,300 indigenous personnel, operating in 28
                            provinces in teams ranging from seven to forty men, now engage in
                            successful civic action, psychological warfare, intelligence and local
                            defense activities.</p>
                        <p>8. Organization, training and supply of Montagnard development
                            communities and self-defense units in a highly flexible manner. In the
                            absence of a positive political approach to the Montagnards, a large
                            Montagnard dissident group, with Cambodian and Viet Cong support, is
                            growing throughout the high plateau. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            has contacts among the Montagnard leadership dating back several years
                            and has the flexibility, if augmented by United States Special Forces
                            support, to undertake to reverse this trend.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_497" n="497" facs="0529"/>
                        <p>9. Provide flexible assistance, in coordination with Province Chiefs, to
                            local partisan groups indicating a will to defend their communities
                            against the Viet Cong. In addition to the Montagnards, there are large
                            numbers of ethnic Vietnamese who, given arms, organization, training and
                            support, can and will defend their home areas against small-scale
                            communist foraging, tax collection, conscription and political
                            indoctrination.</p>
                        <p>10. Expansion of guerrilla and harassment teams working in Viet
                            Cong-controlled areas. Small, well-trained and armed teams penetrate
                            Viet Cong redoubts, heighten peasant dissatisfaction with Viet Cong
                            controls and harass the Viet Cong through black propaganda, mining of
                            trails, neutralization of unpopular officials, and ambush of Viet Cong
                            patrols.</p>
                        <p>11. Develop small irregular elements to track down, infiltrate and
                            capture Viet Cong communication centers. This entails creation of
                            specially trained quick reaction forces who have the capability of
                            investing Viet Cong communication centers rapidly, who know exactly what
                            to look for in terms of important intelligence materiel and personnel
                            and how to obtain quick exploitation of the information received.</p>
                        <p>12. Covertly initiate and support assistance by third country individuals
                            and elements in support of the above programs, e.g.[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] etc. Third
                            country personnel having necessary expertise should be utilized in the
                            above programs. Beyond this value, they tend to dilute the sense of
                            overwhelming American inspiration of these programs and encourage
                            additional participation and commitment of their governments to the
                            successful outcome of the Vietnam war.</p>

                            <item>Discussion with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>—31 March 1965</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. In response to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            request I summarized the current estimates of South Vietnamese, <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, ChiCom and Russian reactions to the
                                <pb xml:id="pg_498" n="498" facs="0530"/>bombing, reporting along
                            the lines of my report to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on
                            March 26th.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Document
                                    217</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Advised <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> of concern over
                            paucity of photographic reconnaissance of South China. Advised him that
                            if ChiNats would not agree to fly, I intended to send a special
                            representative to see Chiang Ching Kuo, and in all probability request
                            authority to fly American pilots over South China in U-2 planes.</p>
                        <p>3. Advised Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> of the
                            analysis of communications indicating that the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> 325th Division Headquarters, now located in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, was in communication with 11
                            components in the area and also in direct communication with Hanoi and
                            we thought this was probably associated with a plan for a concerted
                            action against some point in the northern part of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. In answer to the Ambassador's questions, I stated that we could not
                            interpret the low level of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> current
                            activity to necessarily be attributable to the air operations or orders
                            from Hanoi. It might be explained as a cyclical situation similar to
                            those we have observed before. The Ambassador observed that the period
                            of low level of activity was somewhat longer than experienced before and
                            this apparently is true. I stated that there is no question but what the
                            bombing in the north has interrupted, but not stopped, the flow of
                            cadres and materiel into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Likewise,
                            the tighter coastal patrol and the successful interdiction of several
                            supply ships has had its effect.</p>
                        <p>5. Then told the Ambassador we felt more must be done to encourage the
                            people of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to support the government
                            and its purposes. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            countered by saying that this could only be brought about by a
                            successful military effort and as long as there was discouragement on
                            the part of the people, they would either be apathetic or disinclined to
                            actively support the government. I did not fully agree, and then
                            explained that the President had asked me for recommendations as to what
                            more we could do in South Vietnam to help the U.S. cause. I had
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> read the attached
                            March 31st memorandum to the President and <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DDP</gloss>'s memorandum to me.<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">
                                <ref target="#d222">Document 222</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that he could not
                            take exception to any of the points that we made. He felt all had
                            possibilities but naturally wished any particular action to be spelled
                            out in detail prior to his approval. He asked that we expand on one or
                            all of the proposed actions, transmit the ideas to <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Peter</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName> (whom <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> holds in the highest regard),
                            and he then would consider any recommendations <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName> made.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>6. With respect to Item 7, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            said he had authorized substantial expansion of the program, mentioned
                            200 teams of 40 men for a total of 8,000 personnel to be trained and
                            equipped and directed in this operation. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he was afraid that quality might erode away
                            as the numbers grew and of course this is a possibility. He did not
                            mention “regularizing” this activity by placing it under <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            or <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Action:</hi> I concurred that we would forward
                            specifies to <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">de Silva</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. Throughout the discussion I said that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> felt there was a need for a very considerable amount of
                            covert political and civic action and work with organizations such as
                            religious groups, labor groups, farm groups, etc., which would parallel
                            the more overt and formal actions of the regular agencies. I expressed
                            the opinion that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had very good
                            civilian resources which were not being used and that the United States
                            cause in South Vietnam was suffering on this account. At this point I
                            said that the loss of Montagnard support, which was an outgrowth of
                            Operation Switchback and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s
                            handling of this entire area, was in my opinion unfortunate. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> countered by saying that the
                            Generals, most particularly <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, were very suspicious and resentful of the
                            training of the Montagnards. He felt they were traditional enemies of
                            the South Vietnamese, were considered totally unreliable, and would turn
                            on the government or the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> people at
                            any moment. For this reason the Montagnard program was abandoned at the
                            insistence of the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> government.</p>

                            the recommendations growing out of his <pb xml:id="pg_500" n="500" facs="0532"/>visit will be available for formal presentation to you
                            in the presence of the heads of the departments concerned. This will be
                            quite a substantial meeting in numbers, but it is being kept off the
                            record—and if it leaks it will be billed simply as one more effort to
                            make sure that we are doing everything we can to make our program more
                            efficient and effective.</p>
                        <p>2. The three problems on Max's mind are these:</p>
                        <p>(1) The timing and direction of attack on the North;</p>
                        <p>(2) The timing, size, and mission of any U.S. combat deployments to
                            Vietnam; and</p>
                        <p>(3) The terms and conditions of a political resolution of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>He has done more thinking on (1) and (2) than on (3)—and so have we.</p>
                        <p>3. I think that on (1) he is in reasonable agreement with our outline
                            plans for the next 2 or 3 weeks. But he is prepared to go toward Hanoi
                            faster than <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. You may
                            wish to probe him on this because I sense that you are leaning a little
                            ahead of Bob on this one.</p>
                        <p>4. On U.S. deployments, I think <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> are very close together in the notion of a
                            coastal deployment of the remaining battalions of the Marine
                            Expeditionary Brigade and the effort to get a Korean Battle Group
                            (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Brown</persName> warns from Seoul
                            that he is very wary of this proposal and that the ground would have to
                            be very carefully laid).</p>
                        <p>5. Max's work is still continuing on the proposed actions to beef up our
                            work inside South Vietnam. Max is somewhat resistant to our pressures on
                            this since he feels that his own time and energy should go into the
                            absolutely top priority problems. What he puts at the head of the list
                            is overall troop strength in SouthVietnam—and I think he is probably
                            right, at that. But the other matters also count, and that is one more
                            reason for my conviction that in the long pull we need a <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>-type in Saigon.
                                <persName>John</persName> does see this point.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, you and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will
                            certainly wish to talk over the guidelines for his meetings with
                            Congressional Committees tomorrow and any backgrounding he may do with
                            the press.</p>

                            (as matter of fact was working on reply when explosion came). With all
                            due respect to drafter of memo, I frankly find it confusing, in places
                            seemingly internally contradictory, and thus in short compass, I find it
                            somewhat difficult to come to grips with it. Among problems I have are
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. Implication that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is entitled to
                            have voice in “future political organization in the South” (paras B-9;
                            D-2) and that “fairly substantial international machinery” for which we
                            “should possibly welcome and seek conference situation” would be
                            involved in “an appropriate determination of the will of the people of
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>” (all the first portion of para
                            III). It seems to me that all of this calls into question the legitimacy
                            and mandate of this or any other <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            which may be in power at time of negotiation. I do not see how any
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could accept this which is far
                            different from a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself unilaterally
                            making future provision for a constitutional structure and general
                            elections. As we both know, desirable though general elections may be at
                            some future time, they are no remedy for the ills of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which for a long time is going to
                            require a “strong, effective and stable” government as opposed to some
                            theoretical “democratic” government. Much of the philosophy on this
                            embodied in the memo tends, in my view, to move toward the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> thesis with respect to the 1965
                            elections provided for under the 1954 Geneva Agreement, that is, that
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> should be subjected to the test
                            of elections, but no similar tests should be applied to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. It seems to me our position should
                            continue to be that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, which
                            directs, controls and supports the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            movement, should get out of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in order
                            to leave <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> free to determine its own
                            future in its own way the same as any other country. I emphasize that we
                            should do nothing that calls into question legitimacy of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Based on our past experience, I feel that it is misleading and
                            pursuing a will of the wisp to speak of “reliable” international
                            supervision and inspection of cessation of infiltration (para B-5 and
                            latter part of para III). I am also not clear on how it is proposed that
                            this concept be applied <pb xml:id="pg_502" n="502" facs="0534"/>to Laos
                            which will remain the principal problem. An attempt to negotiate this
                            with respect to Laos will open up the entire 1962 Laos Accords and in
                            fact I wonder whether we will be able to get anything better on paper
                            than that accord with respect to Laos. The principal problem on
                            inspection of cessation of infiltration through Laos is not the 1962
                            agreement but its implementation. I would think that we would do better
                            by insisting on its effective implementation with respect to freedom of
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> movement rather than seeking to
                            negotiate a new accord on Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. I have difficulty with the emphasis throughout the paper on
                            “infiltrators” from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as opposed
                            to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in general. For example, para
                            B-7 speaks only of withdrawal or de-militarization of the infiltrator
                            and in the third paragraph of para III, “some procedure of regroupment
                            and repatriation to the north of those who had come from there”.
                            Pursuing our thesis that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are an
                            organization organized, controlled, supported, and directed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the question is not where a
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> happened in recent time to have
                            come from, but for whom he works. What happens to him and in fact his
                            own desires will presumably be heavily affected by this fact. That is,
                            if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> calls off its <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> dogs here, many who are now in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, even though locally recruited, will
                            presumably desire to proceed to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            and it is in our interest to do the maximum to encourage this. Thus
                            instead of laying stress on return to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> only of “infiltrators”, I would lay the stress on free
                            choice for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, that is, either
                            acceptance of an amnesty here or a return to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The mechanics of such an operation will obviously
                            require negotiation and international supervision will be very
                            desirable. It has been my own view that mechanics could be worked out at
                            bilateral <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> “military level” negotiations and that international
                            supervision readily provided by a simple request from both sides to the
                            existing <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> (personnel of which could
                            be augmented) thus obviating the necessity of a new international
                            mechanism.</p>
                        <p>4. The cessation of our air attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is based on two very vague and difficult to establish
                            conditions, first the stopping or dwindling to a trickle of infiltration
                            and the “cessation of organized unit action of any significant size”
                            (para II). As noted under para III, “this would leave enclaves of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control scattered throughout the
                            country.” While the memo exhorts US “not to accept hardening of somewhat
                            legalized <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control” and not to “let the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> dig in”, as well as not to accept
                            a “legalized role for the liberation front”, it seems to me that these
                            results will be inevitable under this sequence of events. If we accept
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has carried out its
                            obligations (cessation of infiltration and organized unit action of any
                            significant size) and we have thus stopped our air attacks, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will no longer be under any pressure to
                            negotiate on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. We will
                            have to negotiate with somebody and this inevitably leads back to
                            negotiation of some kind with the Liberation <pb xml:id="pg_503" n="503" facs="0535"/>Front. An international conference on the subject can
                            go on indefinitely while the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> do in
                            fact “dig in”. It thus seems to me absolutely essential that in some way
                            or other the original negotiation encompass in some form the cessation
                            of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks as well as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> regroupment and disposition, that is, a
                            choice between acceptance of an amnesty or repatriation to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I fully understand and am in sympathy with the effort in the paper to
                            find some formula that will appear to be less than complete capitulation
                            by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and to leave the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> a “golden door of retreat”. However, I
                            feel that the draft memo is on the one hand so vague and imprecise and
                            on the other hand so full of pitfalls for the future that we should urge
                            a fresh attack on the problem of finding a formula. Some of the

                        <p>In constructing our political track leading to the ending of hostilities,
                            we should first remind ourselves of the terminal situation which we <pb xml:id="pg_504" n="504" facs="0536"/>wish to create. We would like
                            to be assured that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has ceased
                            its support of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency, that
                            the main force <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units and all <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> personnel so desiring, move back into
                            North Viet-Nam, that the former <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            remaining in South Viet-Nam are prepared to become law-abiding citizens,
                            that the Communist commnications network between North and South
                            Viet-Nam is dismantled and that some form of international inspection
                            exists to verify the consummation of these actions. Likewise, there
                            should be some arrangement subject to verification that Laotian
                            territory will no longer be used as a channel of infiltration into South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>To attain these objectives, we have three blue chips to offer Hanoi:
                            cessation of our bombing attacks, the withdrawal of U.S. forces from
                            South Viet-Nam and political and economic assistance for North Viet-Nam.
                            The question is how best to play these chips in order to get in return
                            the objectives indicated above.</p>
                        <p>In exchange for the cessation of bombing we would like to get the
                            cessation of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the withdrawal of main force <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units. While this demand might be our
                            initial position, it seems highly unlikely that both of these
                            concessions could be obtained. In lieu of the requirement to withdraw
                            main force units, an acceptable modification might be an agreement that
                            the major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces would “surface”,
                            identify themselves to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and
                            remain in place pending an arrangement for their evacuation to the
                            North. Implicit in this procedure is the prior presence in South
                            Viet-Nam of a strong <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> type mission
                            capable of monitoring this entire procedure.</p>
                        <p>Also, we must be prepared to resume bombing if negotiations break down or
                            if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> does not live up to its
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>Thus, under the foregoing concept, the first phase would consist of our
                            cessation of bombing in exchange for the termination of aid and
                            direction by Hanoi to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (to include
                            the requirement that all Communist radio traffic be in the clear) and
                            for the surfacing, identification, and immobilization of the main <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units in South Viet-Nam. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> incidents would have to cease and
                            government forces would circulate freely except in the immediate
                            vicinity of the areas occupied by the identified <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units. The second phase might consist of the actions
                            necessary for the withdrawal of all main force units and supporting
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> guerrillas to the North in
                            exchange for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Viet-Nam. Such a
                            withdrawal could be increments, possibly based on percentages of total
                            strength. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units could depart
                            honorably with their arms and colors flying.</p>
                        <p>Upon the completion of phase 2, there would be the pay-off whereby the
                            United States would engage itself to provide political and economic
                            support for both North and South Viet-Nam to assure the viability of
                            both countries as independent, recognized states.</p>

                            of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, although there is now a
                            temporary lull. The threat is particularly serious in the central
                            provinces, and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces may be
                            regrouping for major efforts there in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi has shown no signs of give, and Peiping has stiffened its position
                            within the last week. We still believe that attacks near Hanoi might
                            substantially raise the odds of Peiping coming in with air. Meanwhile,
                            we expect Hanoi to continue and step up its infiltration both by land
                            through Laos and by sea. There are clear indications of different
                            viewpoints in Hanoi, Peiping, and Moscow (and even in the so-called
                            Liberation Front), and continued sharp friction between Moscow and
                            Peiping. However, neither such frictions nor the pressure of our present
                            slowly ascending pace of air attack on North Vietnam can be expected to
                            produce a real change in Hanoi's position for some time, probably 2–3
                            months, at best.</p>
                        <p>A key question for Hanoi is whether they continue to make real headway in
                            the south, or whether the conflict there starts to move against them or
                            at least appear increasingly tough. If the former, even a major step-up
                            in our air attacks would probably not cause them to become much more
                            reasonable; if the latter, the situation might begin to move on a
                            political track—but again in not less than 2–3 months, in our present
                            judgment.</p>

                            tells us <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> will not float it
                            publicly if we reject it privately.) It is not clear that the trade-off
                            would be to our advantage, even if it could be arranged, and in any
                            case, we prefer to use <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> for
                            private feelers rather than public proposals. We can tell <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> that we have no objection on his
                            sounding out Hanoi on this same point, however, and that if he gets a
                            response, we would be glad to comment on it.</p>

                        <p>The 17-nation proposal is more attractive. We are inclined to propose to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> that both South Vietnam
                            and the US should accept it with a covering statement of our good, firm,
                            clear objectives in any such negotiation. The President has already made
                            it clear that he will go anywhere to talk with anyone, and we think the
                            17-nation proposal is one to which we can make a pretty clear response.
                            Tactically, it will probably not lead to an early conference, because
                            the position of Hanoi and Peking will be that they will not attend any
                            meeting until our bombings stop. The Secretary of State will elaborate
                            on these propositions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. More General Political Posture</p>
                        <p>The more general political question, which still needs refinement, is the
                            order and content of the eventual tradeoff. We have three cards of some
                            value: our bombing of North Vietnam, our military presence in South
                            Vietnam, and the political and economic carrots that can be offered to
                            Hanoi. We want to trade these cards for just as much as possible of the
                            following: an end to infiltration of men and supplies, an end of Hanoi's
                            direction, control, and encouragement of the Viet Cong, a removal of
                            cadres under direct Hanoi control, and a dissolution of the organized
                            Viet Cong military and political forces. We do not need to decide today
                            just how we wish to mesh our high cards against Communist concessions.
                            But we will need to be in such a position soon, if only to exchange
                            views with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>. On this more
                            general point, we believe more exploratory conversation with the
                            President is needed today.</p>

                        <p>In view of the inadequate ratio of government forces to the likely pace
                            of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> buildup during 1965, consideration
                            has been given to (and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would
                            recommend) the addition of 2 or 3 division forces to take on limited
                            missions, to release government forces for wider use, and to deter
                            large-scale <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attacks on South
                            Vietnam. Deployment of the forces would proceed in a series of steps,
                            the first of which would require sixty days and would involve the
                            deployment of 2 additional Marine battalions, one Marine air squadron,
                            and the logistical forces referred to in d above.</p>
                        <p>Because the reaction of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the
                            South Vietnamese people to any major US combat deployment is uncertain,
                            as is the likely net effectiveness of US and third country combat forces
                            in the Vietnamese environment, the Secretary of State and the Secretary
                            of Defense recommend that action at this time be limited to approval of
                            the first step. The second and remaining steps could be reviewed
                            approximately 60 days from now.</p>
                        <p>Major third country participation would be a big asset to the program. We
                            may get some small Australian and New Zealand participation, with staff
                            talks going on this week. However, major forces could come only from
                            South Korea. The Secretary of Defense thinks we should seek deployment
                            of Korean “offensive enclave/mobile combat reserve” forces (in the form
                            of a 3500-man regimental combat team) concurrently with deployment of
                            additional US Marines. The Secretary of State points out that the
                            political situation in Korea is touchy, but he believes that we can
                            quietly explore with the Korean Government the possibility of bringing
                            in Korean combat troops on a quiet basis to reinforce and support the
                            2,000 Koreans now in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We should defer any decision on any larger-scale program. However,
                            detailed plans should be made for the logistics to support the possible
                            later introduction of the remainder of the Marine Expeditionary Force
                            (30,000 additional Marines), a US Army Division (30,000 men, including
                            logistics), a possible Korean force bringing their total to a division,
                            and at least one Commonwealth Brigade.</p>

                                identifies the meeting as an official <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting; the attendance list in the Daily Diary is

                        <p>6. With regard to U.S. manpower the following actions were approved:</p>
                        <p>a. An 18,000–20,000 man increase in U.S. military support forces to fill
                            out existing units, and to supply needed logistic personnel.</p>
                        <p>b. Two additional Marine battalions totalling about 3500 men.</p>
                        <p>c. One additional Marine Air squadron of about 700 men.</p>
                        <p>7. The United States Mission in South Vietnam was modified and U.S.
                            Ground Forces were authorized to “engage in counterinsurgency operations
                            in South Vietnam.” Heretofore, the Ground Force Missions have been
                            advisory and for static defense.</p>
                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> strongly recommended that we
                            now reach a tentative decision to deploy three divisions—two U.S.

                            <pb xml:id="pg_514" n="514" facs="0546"/>Division into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> for counterinsurgency combat operations
                            in that country. This recommendation was not approved and no decision
                            was reached. However, some of the 20,000 man increase will be used in
                            preparatory work to receive additional or third country forces for
                            counterinsurgency operations. Preparatory work will involve dredging

                        <p>Also I would like the views of our experts on the reaction of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and the ChiComs to the change in

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> briefed the Council
                            on the diplomatic and political aspects of the Vietnam situation. He
                            noted that a group of 17 unaligned nations presented an appeal to the
                            U.S. and other governments to undertake early negotiations without
                                pre-conditions.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">See <ref target="#d228fn2">footnote 2, Document 228</ref>.</note> He
                            recommended that our reply be serious, restrained and positive. If the
                            other side makes a shrill and unyielding response we will achieve a
                            major propaganda advantage; if they react in a positive way, we will get
                            some clues as to what they may have in mind with respect to possible
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rusk</persName> noted that the House of Commons debate on
                            Vietnam went well and that the “gas” issue was overshadowed by the
                            evidence that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had used it
                            frequently in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by pointing out that the Government in Saigon
                            appears to be stable and effective and that Washington agencies and our
                            Embassy in Saigon were developing some proposals for non-military
                            actions in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> reported that
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions during the past week
                            declined somewhat—except for the dramatic bombing of the Embassy. The
                            Department of Defense is in process of following through on General
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName>'s “21 points.”<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">For a summary, see <ref target="#d197">Document 197</ref>.</note> In particular, early action is being
                            taken in connection with additional helicopter companies, recce

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> referred to the

                            and their desire to move ahead in that direction.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, who had spent
                            the morning on Capitol Hill, indicated that he had no trouble in the
                                House.<note n="6" xml:id="d231fn6">A 99-page transcript of <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s briefing of the Senate
                                Committee on Foreign Relations at 10:30 a.m. is in the Senate
                                Foreign Relations Committee files. No record has been found of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s appearance
                                before any committee of the House of Representatives.</note> The
                            mood of some Senators was one of concern, but not disapproval. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> was worried about
                            reports that the U.S. might send as many as 3 or 4 divisions to Vietnam.
                            The Senator also pointed out that the Joint Resolution might not cover
                            the dispatch of large ground units to Vietnam. Senator Church was
                            interested in the nature of our “carrot” and its relationship to
                            negotiations and bombing. In general, there was considerable interest in
                            the “diplomatic track”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> confirmed, on the basis of his recent experience,
                            that there appeared to be general support for our policy, albeit some
                            worry as well.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he didn't think the sending of U.S. military
                            forces to Vietnam would require a new Congressional Resolution. He felt
                            that our sending troops to Europe in the early '50s was not a relevant
                            analogy.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the group what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would be taking back to
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> stated that there were no
                            new <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> reported on the progress
                            being made in staffing and training for the increased Psy War
                            program.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_516" n="516" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that new
                            logistical arrangements and support were being provided and that there
                            would be an early deployment of two more Marine Battalions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that he
                            had a helpful, useful week in Washington. He felt that he had everything
                            he needed in terms of authority and resources. He indicated the line he
                            would take with the Press: No dramatic change in strategy; we will try
                            to do better what we are doing now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that until the Presidential
                            speech (or next Presidential press statement) all present should be
                            guided by the President's Press Conference of 1 April.<note n="7" xml:id="d231fn7">See <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                                364–372.</note> Under no circumstances should there be any reference
                            to the movement of U.S. forces or other future courses of action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> expressed the view of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> analysts that the Communist
                            position was hardening rather than the reverse as a result of the air
                            strikes. The U.S. should take this into account in future policy
                            decisions, especially in connection with sending additional troops to
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Press was then admitted to question both the President and Ambassador

                                <persName>Bundy</persName> reported that the President converted
                            them, and it is his impression that the group were unanimously in

                            in Democratic journals to see what the actual expressions were after the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Rusk</persName> reported on the seventeen-nation appeal and
                            stated that within two days he would have a carefully worded, serious
                            and restrained reply which would be made public. Similar replies would
                            be made from the Government of South Vietnam. <persName>Rusk</persName>
                            expects replies from Moscow, Peiping, and Hanoi, and stated that if
                            their replies were antagonistic, belligerent, and uncompromising, our
                            position in world opinion would improve. If on the other hand they were
                            serious and restrained, it possibly might indicate an area was open for
                            useful negotiations. <persName>Rusk</persName> commented that the House
                            of Commons debate turned out favorably, there was no loss of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> support, the gas issue was quieting down,
                            the South Vietnam internal political situation appeared somewhat more
                            hopeful, although the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            Government remained a new government totally untried—however, he was
                            hopeful. <persName>Rusk</persName> then went on to review some of the
                            non-military actions which had been approved.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> then reviewed roughly the
                            military actions which had been approved, making a passing reference to
                            the change in the mission assignment<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">See
                                paragraph 7 in <ref target="#d230">Documents 230</ref> and <ref target="#d242">242</ref>.</note> (there was no discussion of
                            this point). He noted that Viet Cong actions had been down for the past
                            four weeks, indicating that this might be the result of our bombing and
                            other military measures.</p>

                            <persName>Bundy</persName> then discussed the plan that is being
                            developed for regional, social, and economic actions. What is envisaged
                            here is U.S. plan to create some sort of Asian organization for the
                            economic and social development of Asia with Western support, but with
                            Asian sponsorship. This is not a South Vietnam question nor is it a bait
                            to North Vietnam, but what is involved is a plan which will improve the
                            U.S. and for that matter all Western standing in Asia. (<persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> is working on this and I suggest
                            that some of our people discuss the plan with him.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then reported
                            on his appearances before the House and Senate committees. He said the
                            House was friendly, sympathetic, and cooperative. The Senate on the
                            other hand was inclined to be critical and dealt harshly with him on the
                            questions:</p>
                        <p>a. How about the reports that we are going to send several divisions of
                            ground troops to South Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>b. Do you think this permissible under existing legislation?</p>
                        <p>c. What about the carrot that we are reading about?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> felt that he responded
                            satisfactorily. He ran into no direct antagonism but no great friendly
                            support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Carl Rowan</persName> reviewed actions taken
                            by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, which are quite extensive and

                        <p>In response to a request by the President for a comment from me, I stated
                            that I could add nothing to the evaluation given last Friday; however, I
                            wished to point out that the air strikes have not brought an indication
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> are softening in their
                            attitude—if anything they have hardened their position. I stated that I
                            felt we must consider this carefully in view of yesterday's decision to
                            change the mission of the ground forces. (I feel the President did not
                            “hoist this point aboard” and I, therefore, asked McBundy to place a
                            copy of my letter to Secretary of State, et al. in the President's
                            reading file tonight. This <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed to do.)</p>
                        <p>The meeting was held up by an exchange between the President and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he had
                            everything he wanted, complete cooperation, and was going home satisfied
                            with his week here. The President was most complimentary of <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Following the meeting I told <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that of the twelve points we proposed,<note n="5" xml:id="d232fn5">See the attachment to <ref target="#d222">Document

                            the generals to promote cohesion. I said that <gloss target="#t_DDP1">DDP</gloss> would have specifics of their plans either in his hands
                            before he left on Saturday or by the time he reached Saigon. He said
                            that he would be very glad to entertain our proposals.</p>

                            For <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> has proposed through you that he
                            might take public initiative to seek a three-month cessation of “all
                            hostile military activity, whether overt or covert, across 17th parallel
                            in Vietnam.”</p>
                        <p>At same time 17 “neutrals” have launched an appeal to all parties
                            concerned, asking for peace talks without preconditions.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">See <ref target="#d228fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    228</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>These two initiatives are not mutually exclusive. But public appeal by 17
                            nations does accomplish one part of what <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would have accomplished by public appeal to <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
                            and US. It creates need for each of three countries militarily engaged
                            (and other addressees as well) to respond publicly and reveal their
                            present attitudes about moving toward a peaceful settlement in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Now that the 17 nations have made this appeal, this makes unnecessary a
                            public initiative by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> at this
                            particular stage.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">For <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s recommendation to

                            explorations and play mediatory role at level of quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_520" n="520" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>We believe that explorations by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> with
                            Hanoi may be important element in search for ways of defusing war in
                            Vietnam. But we would suggest his delaying action, and even suspending
                            judgment on exact form and content of his explorations, until Hanoi has
                            answered 17-nation proposal, and he (and we) can judge from that reply
                            whether there is any possible basis for fruitful talks.</p>
                        <p>For our part, we expect to make a quite forthcoming reply to the 17, and
                            would hope that Saigon will do likewise. We will try to schedule our
                            reply to 17 in such a way that we can make it available as a courtesy to
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> prior to its public release.</p>
                        <p>On the substance of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s proposal, he
                            should be aware that we would want to see substantial changes in the
                            arrangements proposed in his draft, before we would be able to agree
                            with it. You have already mentioned to him two of the points that create
                            difficulties here: the need to cover infiltration through Laos, and the
                            need for some kind of enforcement or inspection machinery to make sure
                            Hanoi would keep to its part of any deal, our part being self-enforcing.
                            But beyond this, we see a more fundamental difficulty in trading a
                            stoppage of the bombing in North Vietnam for a stoppage of the
                            infiltration as such. For Hanoi to “leave its neighbor alone” means to
                            call off organized Viet Cong activity in South Vietnam. Complexities
                            this matter make it difficult, and inadvisable, to try to spell out at
                            this stage with <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> just what
                            kind of mutual cessation of military activity might be acceptable. The
                            main point to make to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> at this stage
                            is our judgment that military activity in South Vietnam must be somehow
                            bracketed with stoppage of infiltration as price for diminution of our
                            own military activity in support of Saigon.</p>
                        <p>In sum:</p>
                        <p>(a) We want to preserve <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> as useful
                            channel for quiet diplomacy as this situation develops.</p>
                        <p>(b) 17-nation appeal provides basis for reformulation each of nations
                            involved in Vietnam war, of their attitudes toward moving in direction
                            of peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>(c) We strongly urge that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> await
                            replies to 17-nation appeal, especially from Hanoi, and then consult
                            further about nature, content and timing of private explorations he
                            might then undertake.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I remain concerned, as I have said before to you, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, over the limited scale of
                            air action against North Vietnam which we envision for the next few
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Specifically I feel that we must conduct our bombing attacks in a manner
                            that will begin to hurt North Vietnam badly enough to cause the Hanoi
                            regime to seek a political way out through negotiation rather than
                            expose their economy to increasingly serious levels of destruction. By
                            limiting our attacks to targets like bridges, military installations and
                            lines of communication, in effect we signal to the Communists that our
                            determination to win is significantly modified by our fear of widening
                            the war.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Communists are likely to feel they can afford
                            to accept a considerable amount of bomb damage while they improve their
                            air defenses and step up their insurgency in South Vietnam. If they take
                            this line of action, in the next few months they can present us with an
                            ever-increasing guerrilla war against the reinforced Viet Cong in
                            terrain and circumstances favorable to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>If this situation develops and lasts several months or more, I feel world
                            opinion will turn against us, Communist propaganda will become
                            increasingly effective, and indeed domestic support of our policy may
                            erode.</p>
                        <p>I therefore urge that as we deploy additional troops, which I believe
                            necessary, we concurrently hit the north harder and inflict greater
                            damage. In my opinion, we should strike their petroleum supplies,
                            electric power installations, and air defense installations (including
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites which are now being
                            built). I do not think we have to fear taking on the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s, which after all the ChiNats defeated
                            in 1958 with F-86's and Sidewinders.</p>
                        <p>I am not talking about bombing centers of population or killing innocent
                            people, though there will of course be some casualties. I am proposing
                            to “tighten the tourniquet” on North Vietnam so as to make the
                            Communists pause to weigh the losses they are taking against their
                            prospects for gains. We should make it hard for the Viet Cong to win in
                            the <pb xml:id="pg_522" n="522" facs="0554"/>south and simultaneously
                            hard for Hanoi to endure our attacks in the north.</p>
                        <p>I believe this course of action holds out the greatest promise we can
                            hope for in our effort to attain our ultimate objective of finding a
                            political solution to the Vietnam problem. This view follows logically,
                            it seems to me, from our National Intelligence Estimate of 18 February
                                1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">
                                <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note> which concludes that
                            the Hanoi regime would be more likely than not to make an effort to
                            “secure a respite” by some political move when and if, but not before, a
                            sustained U.S. program of air attacks is damaging important economic or
                            military assets in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I attach a copy of my memorandum of April 2nd, which may not have come to
                            your attention, since it argues this case in a little more detail.</p>

                        <p>Washington, April 2, 1965.</p>
                        <p>I have been giving thought to the paper<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">Apparently a reference to <ref target="#d228">Document
                                228</ref>.</note> that we discussed in yesterday's meeting, which
                            unfortunately I had little time to study, and also to the decision made
                            to change the mission of our ground forces in South Vietnam from one of
                            advice and static defense to one of active combat operations against the
                            Viet Cong guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the latter decision is correct only if our air strikes
                            against the North are sufficiently heavy and damaging really to hurt the
                            North Vietnamese. The paper we examined yesterday does not anticipate
                            the type of air operation against the North necessary to force the
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> to reappraise their policy. On
                            the contrary, it states, “We should continue roughly the present slowly
                            ascending tempo of Rolling Thunder operations—,” and later, in outlining
                            the types of targets, states “The target systems should continue to
                            avoid the effective GCI range of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s,”
                            and <pb xml:id="pg_523" n="523" facs="0555"/>these conditions indicate
                            restraints which will not be persuasive to the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and would probably be read as evidence of a U.S. desire
                            to temporize.</p>
                        <p>I have reported<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5">See <ref target="#d196">Document 196</ref>.</note> that the strikes to date have not
                            caused a change in the North Vietnamese policy of directing Viet Cong
                            insurgency, infiltrating cadres and supplying material. If anything, the
                            strikes to date have hardened their attitude.</p>
                        <p>I have now had a chance to examine the 12-week program<note n="6" xml:id="d234fn6">The 12-week program of air strikes against North
                                Vietnam was described in <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> 's memorandum <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–221–65 to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, March 27. (Washington National Records
                                Center, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 330, <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> Files: FRC 70 A 1265, Vietnam
                                381)</note> referred to by General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and it is my personal opinion that this program
                            is not sufficiently severe or damaging to the North Vietnamese to cause
                            them to compromise their present policy.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we must look with care to our position under a program
                            of slowly ascending tempo of air strikes. With the passage of each day
                            and each week, we can expect increasing pressure to stop the bombing.
                            This will come from various elements of the American public, from the
                            press, the United Nations and world opinion. Therefore time will run
                            against us in this operation and I think the North Vietnamese are
                            counting on this.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I think what we are doing is starting on a track which involves
                            ground force operations which, in all probability, will have limited
                            effectiveness against guerrillas, although admittedly will restrain some
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> advances. However, we can expect
                            requirements for an ever-increasing commitment of U.S. personnel without
                            materially improving the chances of victory. I support and agree with
                            this decision but I must point out that in my judgment, forcing
                            submission of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can only be brought
                            about by a decision in Hanoi. Since the contemplated actions against the
                            North are modest in scale, they will not impose unacceptable damage on
                            it, nor will they threaten the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s
                            vital interests. Hence, they will not present them with a situation with
                            which they cannot live, though such actions will cause the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> pain and inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>I believe our proposed track offers great danger of simply encouraging
                            Chinese Communist and Soviet support of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cause if for no
                            other reason than the risk for both will be minimal. I envision that the
                            reaction of the <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and Chinese
                            Communists will be to deliberately, carefully, and probably gradually,
                            build up the Viet Cong capabilities by covert infiltration of North
                            Vietnamese and, possibly, Chinese cadres and thus bring an
                            ever-increasing pressure on our forces. In effect, we will find
                            ourselves mired down in combat in the jungle in a military effort <pb xml:id="pg_524" n="524" facs="0556"/>that we cannot win, and from
                            which we will have extreme difficulty in extracting ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is my judgment that if we are to change the mission of the
                            ground forces, we must also change the ground rules of the strikes
                            against North Vietnam. We must hit them harder, more frequently, and
                            inflict greater damage. Instead of avoiding the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s, we must go in and take them out. A bridge here and
                            there will not do the job. We must strike their air fields, their
                            petroleum resources, power stations and their military compounds. This,
                            in my opinion, must be done promptly and with minimum restraint.</p>
                        <p>If we are unwilling to take this kind of a decision now, we must not take
                            the actions concerning the mission of our ground forces for the reasons
                            I have mentioned above.</p>

                            said there was no point of issue between the two ends of Pennsylvania
                            Avenue on that point; there would be the fullest consultation with
                            Congress. C said he appreciated the Sec's call.” (Department of State,

                            should be working on a more comprehensive revision of the March 19
                            memorandum, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GREEN1">Green</persName> and

                            time permits during the week. I will come back at it after that.</p>

                            designed to bring out the stages of our present thinking and to elicit
                            his comments particularly on the content of the early stages. The stages
                            appear to be:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Conditions for cessation of attacks on the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On this point, papers 3 and 4 are really not far apart, that our asking
                            price might include withdrawal of units from the South, but that we
                            might settle for cessation of infiltration (de facto) plus a major
                            reduction in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in the South,
                            plus a surfacing and groupment of the major forces in the South,
                            together with a commitment to move rapidly to a stage of
                            withdrawal/demilitarization. If Hanoi did not in fact move to this
                            stage, we would reserve the right to resume attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Withdrawal/demilitarization stage.</p>
                        <p>We all agree that, whatever conditions we get for the cessation of
                            attacks on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, we cannot accept a
                            condition in which the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units were
                            simply left intact in the South. My memorandum argued that the
                            withdrawal/demilitarization phase required a lot of international
                            supervision, and that we would have to move to some kind of multilateral
                            discussion in order to get this. We need to do some more work on whether
                            the multilateral method would have to be a reconvened Geneva Conference,
                            or whether the effort might be made to bring in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at this stage.</p>

                            length. I certainly agree that we do not want to concede any <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> voice on this, and I think we all agree
                            that we must stand firm against any legalized role for the Liberation
                            Front. In so doing, however, we probably will want to say that South
                            Viet-Nam should in due course find a way of expressing the popular will
                            to “determine its own future” (the President's phrase of last
                                week),<note n="8" xml:id="d236fn8">For text of the President's

                            a pretty good line of defense against legalizing the Liberation Front. I
                            don't think this is singling out South Viet-Nam or need be phrased in

                            bridge for the time being in any case, and I don't think we need to be
                            at all specific on it with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>

                        <p>As stated in the March 19 memorandum, I think this is not too
                            difficult.</p>

                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Here we have one immediate question, whether we might foreshadow
                            recognition of North Viet-Nam, as <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van
                                Do</persName> has suggested.<note n="9" xml:id="d236fn9">See <ref target="#d225fn3">footnote 3, Document 225</ref>.</note> We
                            might also consider whether we should foreshadow the possibility of
                            peaceful trade between the two Viet-Nams. My own feeling is that we
                            could do both of these, and conceivably in a broad form as early as the
                            reply to the 17 nations. It is in the present draft to be discussed.</p>
                        <p>The really tough problem is the question of eventual unification and
                            “free elections” in all Viet-Nam. This is the main sticking point in our
                            adhering to past formulations about “the essential elements of the 1954
                            agreement.” I know that the Secretary is troubled about this problem; my
                            own personal view is that we would not be badly off if we stuck to the
                            old position that we were always prepared, in the case of divided
                            countries, to see the will of the people determined by free elections
                            under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or other international
                            supervision. We would have to worry about taking the position in
                            Viet-Nam different from the strong positions we have taken in Germany
                            and Korea. As a practical matter, I myself think that this formulation
                            would move the issue so far down the road that we would not have to
                            worry about it, although I would wholly agree that we should not accept
                            the setting of a definite date for future elections in any reaffirmed
                            Geneva Agreement, as the setting of such a date, in itself, would have a
                            disruptive effect in the South. This too is an issue that I do not see
                            us facing in the early stages of discussion, and I should think we could
                            go on trying to play the card pretty close to our chest for the time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>In a sense, all of this—but particularly point 1 and perhaps point
                            5—relate to the contents of the reply to the 17 nations. We will be
                            discussing this today and perhaps cabling the draft to <persName corresp="#p_QSA1">Alex</persName>,<note n="10" xml:id="d236fn10">Regarding the drafting of the U.S. Government's reply to the

                            which had been held in line up to now through the President's strenuous
                            efforts, would no longer support our actions in Viet-Nam. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that he
                            understood the situation in the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he hoped Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would therefore not be too
                            specific in relating the Washington decisions to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and that he would
                            inform the Vietnamese of specific events, such as the 21-point
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> program, only just before they were
                            about to take place.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then showed
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> the paper entitled
                            “Subjects for Discussion with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>” dated
                            April 3 (attached). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said the additional Marine deployments would
                            require clearance from <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>.
                            There was discussion of the revised Marine mission, as summarized in the
                            memorandum of April 3 prepared by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> .<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">
                                <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said an instruction to the
                            Marines was necessary to encourage them to patrol deeply, in cooperation
                            with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units. There was agreement
                            that the Marines should be used in 1) local counterinsurgency in a
                            mobile posture and in 2) strike reaction, and that they should have an
                            “active and aggressive posture”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said later in the discussion that he did not yet
                            want to give up the ability to describe their mission as defensive.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the Ambassador
                            could mention the reinforcements (points A 2 and A 3) to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, but said the President has not
                            yet cleared the idea of further offensive enclaves, so any discussions
                            with the Vietnamese should be ambiguous and emphasize the logistic
                            aspects of <pb xml:id="pg_529" n="529" facs="0561"/>point A 5. The
                            remaining points under overall heading A presented no particular
                            problems, but implementing messages from Washington will be required for
                            some of them.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the draft reply<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> to the 17-nation
                            proposal and the Secretary said the replies of the United States and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be consistent but
                            different. The Vietnamese could be more shrill in their response.
                            Various changes were made by the participants in the draft reply.</p>
                        <p>With regard to points B and C under overall point B, the Secretary said
                            our and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s actions toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> concerning negotiations should
                            be parallel and consistent; we should consult together but our responses
                            need not be identical and we should not get tongue-tied.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary digressed to say he wanted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> in the course of consultations
                            about future actions that we realized that the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was one in which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s responsibilities were paramount and
                            in which they were taking the heavy casualties; however, the United
                            States would bear 100% of the responsibility and repercussions in case
                            the war “escalated”. The Secretary emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should understand this point
                            clearly.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be the mouthpiece in any
                            discussions with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (point C) and
                            the Secretary said not necessarily except perhaps with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. In this connection, the Secretary
                            said, and he returned once again later to this point, that we should
                            explore with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> whether there
                            was any possibility of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s talking
                            to Front leaders and persuading a couple of them to defect. Such
                            defectors, who would say publicly the whole Front was a fraud and a
                            sham, would be worth a great deal—perhaps several mission [million?]
                            dollars in Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>As to point D, it was agreed that it was not yet possible to determine
                            how we would play our high cards in any negotiations and what we hoped
                            to get for each card.</p>
                        <p>The discussion turned to the draft <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>,<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">Apparently a draft of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 328, <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> which was accordingly revised.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> reminded the
                            group that clearance of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was
                            required on a number of the items included in it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> emphasized the need for
                            very tight public information controls on these matters.</p>

                        <p>In the course of their discussion this morning about the deployment to Da
                            Nang and Hue of two additional Marine battalions, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> addressed themselves to the
                            mission those Marines would play. They both departed from the premise
                            that the intention was for the Marines to play a bigger and more active
                            role than the Marines now deployed at Da Nang.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> envisaged that in
                            the first instance the Marines would carry on aggressive patrolling
                            around the base areas moving more deeply into the surrounding areas than
                            they do at the present time. They would always carry out this patrolling
                            with some Vietnamese accompanying them. A second mission would be a
                            mobile reserve to support <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            operations as this appeared useful. The Secretary emphasized that in the
                            initial period this kind of action should only be taken in the general
                            area of Da Nang or Phu Bai and not too far afield. He stressed that this
                            should relate to the rationale of this deployment of the Marines and
                            their action should be what they would be in anticipation of a strike
                            against Da Nang or Phu Bai.</p>
                        <p>As for the Marines already deployed in South Viet-Nam, the Secretary felt
                            that their mission should remain as at present until the new Marines
                            arrive, at which point they would also acquire the new missions as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also emphasized that
                            in discussing with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> the logistic development of certain coastal
                            enclaves, this should be treated in very low key and stated in very
                            general terms with nothing that would lead the Vietnamese to begin to
                            think in terms of the deployment of U.S. divisions. He agreed with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s suggestion
                            that we could discuss with the Vietnamese the actions we considered
                            necessary in terms of normal repairs and improvements for current
                            operations and to meet possible contingency needs.</p>

                            counterinsurgency combat operations. Concept for employment of <gloss target="#t_MEB1">MEB</gloss> forces in Danang-Hue-Phu Bai area to be
                            developed in field in accord with high level Washington discussions to
                            be communicated by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. In view military and political implications
                            request report on mission of Marine elements be furnished Washington as
                            soon as talks with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> completed.</p>
                        <p>Pacing of deployments is of critical import as we do not desire give
                            impression rapid massive buildup but intent is to accomplish deployment
                            of above Marine forces earliest feasible after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> secures permission <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Desire indicate we continuing on
                            course previously set and gradual buildup proceeding according to plan.
                            In keeping this policy, deployments, other than Marines, will be spaced
                            over period time with publicity re all deployments kept at lowest key
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> showed Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and his officers a
                            number of key papers dealing with his Washington consultations. The
                            Ambassador emphasized that none of the material dealing with political
                            matters (the Political Track) should be discussed with staff. Copies of

                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>. The following
                            topics were discussed:</p>
                        <p>1) Leaflet Drops in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>. The Ambassador
                            reported that the concept had been approved and that a cable on the
                            subject was in preparation,<note n="4" xml:id="d240fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> but Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wanted to approve each specific operational
                            aspect. The Secretary of Defense was particularly dubious about the
                            “warning” type of leaflet.</p>
                        <p>2) Expanded Mission for the Marines. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he had expected a message
                            from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> giving language for the
                            expanded mission. He sent a telegram on this subject to the Department
                            and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d240fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s request for

                                which replied in telegram 2197 to Saigon, April 5. Both telegrams
                                are in Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> party arrived back in Saigon on April

                        </p>
                        <p>3) The Tempo of Rolling Thunder. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> said he felt the attacks on radar sites were a
                            waste of time and that we had lost a week trying to take them out. On
                            the other hand, the armed road reconnaissance was worthwhile and should
                            be very worrisome and damaging to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had directed the preparation of a three-month
                            program which would cover targets in <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            except those in the Hanoi area. There was discussion of the opposing <pb xml:id="pg_534" n="534" facs="0566"/>points of view represented by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> that we were not
                            really hurting <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and should step up
                            our attacks heavily if we are also taking the step of introducing U.S.
                            combat forces, and that of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> which favored a slowly rising tempo of attacks
                            on the North and the introduction of as many troops in the South as we
                            felt necessary. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> felt troop additions would not bother the
                            Soviets at all, while too fast an escalation of targets carried the
                            danger of forcing the Soviets and Chinese together. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said the Washington talks had
                            unfortunately not really focused on the opposing viewpoints. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> said he did not agree
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s view.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed interest
                            in an economic blockage and in the idea of mining <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> harbors and destroying railway bridges.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> said if we are
                            going to do that, we should do it before the Soviet ships which are en
                            route arrive, warning them in advance that we are doing so.</p>
                        <p>4) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then turned
                            to the list of items emerging from his Washington consultations for
                            discussion with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>. He said he had already discussed with him in
                            general terms the 21-point <persName>Johnson</persName> program. He said
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was
                            willing to see an increase in logistics and preparation of logistic
                            enclaves to be ready for the introduction of combat forces. However,
                            neither he nor any other civilian leaders, from the President down, were
                            convinced of the need for divisions. There was fear that American troops
                            might be trapped inland and would have to fight their way out to the sea
                            through mutinous South Vietnamese troops in a civil war situation.</p>
                        <p>5) To sum up his Washington talks, the Ambassador said he had gone there
                            hoping to clarify three chief problems: (1) the tempo of Rolling
                            Thunder, (2) the introduction of U.S. combat forces to close the
                            manpower gap, and (3) the Political Track or how do we end the war. On
                            the first two, the Ambassador felt he had obtained relatively clear
                            guidance; on the third, it was evident our thinking had not been
                            refined. We had two top cards to play: 1) stop bombing the North and 2)
                            withdraw our forces from the South. With them, we wanted to obtain 1) a
                            cessation of infiltration of arms, men and direction from <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>; and 2) the end of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks in the South and withdrawal or
                            surfacing under amnesty of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units in
                            the South. There was some inclination to play the two cards separately
                            in isolation against the Communist cards, but the Ambassador did not
                            agree with this idea and thought the President also did not, from
                            remarks he had made. We had also thought of ways to permit the
                            Communists a way out without abject surrender; and we had considered
                            such matters as political (recognition, admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, assurance of security) and economic
                            (trade, <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> development programs)
                            carrots.</p>
                        <p>6) Finally, there was brief discussion of command organizations.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he
                            thought there were two contingencies <pb xml:id="pg_535" n="535" facs="0567"/>involved: (1) the counterinsurgency effort in its
                            larger dimensions in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and (2) general
                            war with China. While we should be thinking about and prepared for the
                            latter, we should not let our plans for such an eventuality hamper our
                            best efforts in organizing ourselves to deal with the former. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> agreed.</p>

                            areas, one airfield, nine radar sites, and three highway/railroad
                            bridges and associated routes.</p>
                        <p>2. Until 3 April when a MIG damaged a U.S. aircraft, and 4 April, when
                            two North Vietnamese MIGs shot down two U.S. planes, enemy reaction had
                            been limited to antiaircraft fire from weapons up to 57-mm caliber. The
                            South Vietnamese have lost six planes with one pilot believed killed,
                            and two missing. U.S. losses have been 25 planes with one pilot killed,
                            two pilots captured, and nine missing.</p>
                        <p>3. The air strikes have not reduced in any major way the over-all
                            military capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Damage
                            inflicted on the Army supply depots and ammunition depots has, of
                            course, reduced available supplies <pb xml:id="pg_536" n="536" facs="0568"/>of certain military items, but these losses should not
                            be critical to North Vietnamese military operations. Damage to the naval
                            base, army barracks, the air fields and radar sites was not such as to
                            hamper in a serious way <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            capabilities. We have no estimate of <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            casualties. I believe that the destruction of the railroad/highway
                            bridges at Thanh Hoa and Dong Phuong and the Dong Hoi highway bridge is
                            the most damaging military blow delivered to date. The loss of these
                            bridges will slow down logistical support to the southern portion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. If we follow up as planned with
                            additional strikes against railroad and highway bridges, railroad
                            rolling stock trapped south of Thanh Hoa, and armed reconnaissance
                            missions along the key highways south of the 20th parallel, we should be
                            able to apply a serious stricture to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            logistical support to the south, including that to Laos and to the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Prior to the recent strikes on the bridges, the economic effects of
                            our attacks were minimal. No doubt the fishing industry has been
                            harassed by maritime operations and armed reconnaissance flights along
                            the coast. The line of communications strikes referred to above should
                            apply increasing economic pressures as well as military logistic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>5. The air strikes have caused a build-up of <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss> defenses and, coupled with the shore defenses including
                            beach watcher units established by the North Vietnamese Government
                            because of maritime operations, have the effect of increasing the number
                            of regular military and para-military forces. In other words, manpower
                            resources devoted to military activities have been increased at the
                            expense of those available to the economy.</p>
                        <p>6. Any assessment of the impact of our air strikes on the attitudes of
                            the North Vietnamese Government and people must be deduced from the
                            small evidence available to the outside world from a closed Communist
                            society. I believe that the following estimates are reasonable
                            conclusions in the light of the evidence we have:</p>
                        <p>a. The military are keenly aware of the destructive potential of our
                            forces. They are attempting to establish ground defenses to make us pay
                            a good price for every target struck. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Air Force exhibited considerable daring in its two
                            clashes with our aircraft. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Navy
                            has dispersed and has issued instructions to its vessels not to open
                            fire on hostile aircraft unless the aircraft actually initiate an attack
                            against them.</p>
                        <p>b. There are indications that the North Vietnamese people are
                            apprehensive of the future. One report highlights the difference in
                            public attitude in Haiphong in January—described as “exultant”—and that
                            in March described as “depressed and fearful.”</p>
                        <p>c. Outwardly, the North Vietnamese Government appears to be uninfluenced
                            by our air strikes. The degree to which this official attitude <pb xml:id="pg_537" n="537" facs="0569"/>is based upon a desire to
                            reassure its own people, to influence world attitudes against the United
                            States and to discourage us from continuing offensive actions is
                            imponderable. Moreover, the North Vietnamese Government may believe
                            that, with the support of Communist China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            successes in South Vietnam and world opinion will eventually give them
                            the victory. In other words, they are willing to pay a price for South
                            Vietnam. On the other hand, intercepted messages reveal that certain
                            population centers have been partially evacuated, air raid shelters have
                            been prepared and air raid drills conducted, and the government has
                            increased military defenses.</p>
                        <p>7. In summary, I think it fair to state that our strikes to date, while
                            damaging, have not curtailed <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            military capabilities in any major way. The same is true as regards the
                            North Vietnamese economy. The North Vietnamese people exhibit an
                            understandable degree of apprehension for the future. The Hanoi
                            Government continues to maintain, at least publicly, stoical
                            determination.</p>

                            the President made the following decisions with respect to Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>1. Subject to modifications in the light of experience, and to
                            coordination and direction both in Saigon and in Washington, the
                            President <pb xml:id="pg_538" n="538" facs="0570"/>approved the 41-point
                            program of non-military actions submitted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in a memorandum dated March 31,
                                1965.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">See <ref target="#d228fn3">footnote 3, Document 228</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The President gave general approval to the recommendations submitted
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> in his report dated
                            March 16,<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">For a summary, see <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> with the exception
                            that the President withheld approval of any request for supplemental
                            funds at this time—it is his decision that this program is to be
                            energetically supported by all agencies and departments and by the
                            reprogramming of available funds as necessary within <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The President approved the urgent exploration of the 12 suggestions
                            for covert and other actions submitted by the Director of Central
                            Intelligence under date of March 31.<note n="5" xml:id="d242fn5">See the
                                attachment to <ref target="#d222">Document 222</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. The President repeated his earlier approval of the 21-point program of
                            military actions submitted by General Harold K. Johnson under date of
                            March 14<note n="6" xml:id="d242fn6">See <ref target="#d197">Document
                                    197</ref>.</note> and re-emphasized his desire that aircraft and
                            helicopter reinforcements under this program be accelerated.</p>
                        <p>5. The President approved an 18–20,000 man increase in U.S. military
                            support forces to fill out existing units and supply needed logistic
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>6. The President approved the deployment of two additional Marine
                            Battalions and one Marine Air Squadron and associated headquarters and
                            support elements.</p>
                        <p>7. The President approved a change of mission for all Marine Battalions
                            deployed to Vietnam to permit their more active use under conditions to
                            be established and approved by the Secretary of Defense in consultation
                            with the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>8. The President approved the urgent exploration, with the Korean,

                            of the possibility of rapid deployment of significant combat elements
                            from their armed forces in parallel with the additional Marine
                            deployment approved in paragraph 6.</p>
                        <p>9. Subject to continuing review, the President approved the following
                            general framework of continuing action against North Vietnam and
                            Laos:</p>
                        <p>We should continue roughly the present slowly ascending tempo of Rolling
                            Thunder operations, being prepared to add strikes in response to <pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0571"/>a higher rate of VC operations,
                            or conceivably to slow the pace in the unlikely event VC slacked off
                            sharply for what appeared to be more than a temporary operational
                            lull.</p>
                        <p>The target systems should continue to avoid the effective GCI range of
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s. We should continue to vary the
                            types of targets, stepping up attacks on lines of communication in the
                            near future, and possibly moving in a few weeks to attacks on the rail
                            lines north and northeast of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Leaflet operations should be expanded to obtain maximum practicable
                            psychological effect on the North Vietnamese population.</p>
                        <p>Blockade or aerial mining of North Vietnamese ports need further study
                            and should be considered for future operations. It would have major
                            political complications, especially in relation to the Soviets and other
                            third countries, but also offers many advantages.</p>
                        <p>Air operation in Laos, particularly route blocking operations in the
                            Panhandle area, should be stepped up to the maximum remunerative
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>10. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will
                            promptly seek the reactions of the South Vietnamese Government to
                            appropriate sections of this program and their approval as necessary,
                            and in the event of disapproval or difficulty at that end, these
                            decisions will be appropriately reconsidered. In any event, no action
                            into Vietnam under paragraphs 6 and 7 above should take place without
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approval or further Presidential
                            authorization.</p>
                        <p>11. The President desires that with respect to the actions in paragraphs
                            5 through 7, premature publicity be avoided by all possible precautions.
                            The actions themselves should be taken as rapidly as practicable, but in
                            ways that should minimize any appearance of sudden changes in policy,
                            and official statements on these troop movements will be made only with
                            the direct approval of the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with
                            the Secretary of State. The President's desire is that these movements
                            and changes should be understood as being gradual and wholly consistent
                            with existing policy.</p>

                        <p>3246. For the President. The bombing of the Embassy on March 30 was the
                            dominating event of the week. The local press, and many Vietnamese
                            privately, expressed indignation and outrage at this act of terrorism.
                            While the bombing brought home once again that the Viet Cong can strike
                            in the heart of Saigon, it did not seem to dampen the improved morale of
                            the Vietnamese. American community is entirely unshaken.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, Quat and his colleagues have continued to move ahead
                            with concrete constructive measures in the political field. The week
                            witnessed:</p>
                        <p>A) An announcement by the National Legislative Council that a National
                            Congress should be convened to take up the urgent task of drawing up a
                            permanent constitution, and that the Congress should be based on direct
                            universal suffrage organized in secure zones.</p>
                        <p>B) The opening of a press congress to develop a statute governing the
                            conduct of the local press.</p>
                        <p>C) Indications from the government that it would hold elections early
                            next month for city and municipal councils.</p>
                        <p>D) An announcement by the government that it is 1) establishing an
                            Embassy in Addis Ababa, with an information center to serve all of
                            Africa; 2) dispatching a delegation headed by Vice Premier Tuyen, to
                            visit key African capitals; and 3) opening competition to fill 20
                            vacancies in the Vietnamese Diplomatic and Consular Service.</p>
                        <p>E) An announcement that Quat will reserve Thursday afternoons to meet
                            with members of the public.</p>
                        <p>Another interesting development, but one on which we still have only
                            tentative and fragmentary information, has been the emergence of signs
                            of Buddhist protests against Viet Cong depredations against Buddhist
                            monks and pagodas. We understand that the Buddhist Institute has
                            instructed pagodas to pray for a Buddhist monk in Binh Dinh Province who
                            reportedly burned himself to death in protest against such Viet Cong
                            actions. The Buddhist Institute also held a memorial service for the
                            American and Vietnamese victims of the Embassy bombing. These are
                            heartening, if still isolated, signs of an improved attitude in Buddhist
                            ranks.</p>
                        <p>In the military field, the Viet Cong continued to lie low, their
                            activities reaching a level even lower than that recorded during the
                            lunar festival period of early February. In spite of their inertia, they
                            took heavy losses in engagements with the government forces in which the
                            friendly <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0573"/>total killed in action
                            amounted to 189 against 795 Viet Cong dead. The enemy also lost 80
                            captured and over 200 weapons. While this is good news, we still have
                            the uneasy feeling that the Viet Cong may be preparing unpleasant
                            surprises for us. During the week, we acquired reasonably clear evidence
                            that elements of the North Vietnamese 325th division have been in South
                            Viet-Nam since February. The presence of one battalion is confirmed and
                            it is possible all three regiments are operating in the central
                            provinces. We are pressing all intelligence agencies to determine what
                            the Viet Cong are up to.</p>
                        <p>Reports of improved morale are now coming in from the provinces,
                            indicating that the rise in confidence noted in urban centers is
                            beginning to spread to the countryside. While more indications will be
                            needed to establish the extent of the trend, this is the first time in
                            months that we have had such encouraging reports on provincial
                            morale.</p>

                        <p>3248. Together with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName>,
                            I saw Quat alone afternoon April 6 and briefly reviewed with him matters
                            arising out of my Washington visit. At outset, I strongly stressed
                            Washington view that no amount of bombardment of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is going to convince Hanoi to call off its action down
                            here without real progress in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Hanoi must be convinced that
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> cannot win here. Thus our strategy
                            in 1965 calls for a balanced program as between action against DRV and
                            in-country action. Quat entirely agreed.</p>
                        <p>With respect Rolling Thunder, I said that we planned to continue along
                            presently projected lines without radical change either up or down. Quat
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>I then outlined our view of the manpower gap, showing Quat a chart
                            indicating that, if <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength maintains
                            present upward trend and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            accomplished presently projected force goals, ratio of strength will be
                            even less favorable at end of year. I then outlined Washington
                            discussions <pb xml:id="pg_542" n="542" facs="0574"/>and decisions
                            including 21 point General <persName corresp="#p_JGH1">Johnson</persName> program to improve effectiveness of existing
                            programs, the proposed additional Marine battalions, and the RB-66 task
                                force.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">The RB-66 was a B-66 turbojet
                                light bomber modified for reconnaissance.</note> I also mentioned
                            the possibility of additional third country contributions, such as from
                            Australia, New Zealand and Korea. I tied proposed Marine deployments to
                            Quat's previous remarks to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex
                                Johnson</persName> on desirability of enlarging Danang
                                perimeter.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">Quat's suggestion to
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> was reported in telegram 3154 from
                                Saigon, March 31. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S)</note> I also referred
                            to increased Navy surveillance program and the additional equipment for
                            popular forces which has been approved.</p>
                        <p>With respect to manpower gap, Quat said that he has asked <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> urgently to study this problem
                            with senior officers, particularly with respect to more effective
                            “political mobilization” throughout country. In passing, he said that he
                            felt that the regional and popular force figures on those present for
                            duty were padded and he very much felt this needed looking into. He also
                            felt that a more aggressive spirit was much needed among many of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officers and that morale in
                            the Army could be improved by better administration of present
                            provisions for troop welfare, veterans' benefits, etc. I gather that he
                            has been discussing all these matters with <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>He was entirely receptive to the addition of Marine deployments in the
                            Danang area but wanted to discuss matter with <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName>
                            before giving us a final answer or authorizing Westmoreland to undertake
                            discussions at military level. With respect to these forces, as well as
                            possible addition third country forces, he said that he was receptive
                            and entirely understood and accepted our rationale but that he has a
                            political problem of public presentation which required careful
                            handling. He indicated that this involves what he termed a strongly
                            nationalistic minority who could be expected to oppose introduction of
                            foreign combat forces.</p>
                        <p>In discussing naval surveillance in the Gulf of Siam, he said he was
                            anxious to find some way of improving relations with Cambodia and
                            referred to a proposal that he had made when FonMin in Khanh's govt for
                            the establishment of a “no man's land” or “free zone” some five
                            kilometers in depth on the Vietnamese side of the border from which all
                            friendly Vietnamese population would be removed. He said the numbers
                            would not be very large. In the zone all civilians could be assumed to
                            be hostile and subject to military or police action.</p>
                        <p>I also referred in broad terms to our plans for the construction of a new
                            chancery, the “41 points”, and the <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> program on public information. On the “41 points”,
                            I sought to obtain from him the designation of a contact point within
                            the govt. After some “thinking aloud” on <pb xml:id="pg_543" n="543" facs="0575"/>the role of Tuyen, he finally came around to say that
                            at this stage he wanted to handle it himself and that Killen and I
                            should bring the matter to him.</p>
                        <p>In referring to our needs for office space here, particularly that of
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, he said that he was
                            considering the formation of some sort of a govt enterprise which would
                            build space to our specifications, just as a private contractor or
                            landlord, so that at such time as [US] no longer had need of the space,
                            the govt would be in possession of some better buildings. I indicated
                            our willingness to explore this with him further.</p>
                        <p>In response to my request, he agreed to look into the matter of trying to
                            bring about a defector from the National Liberation Front who could be
                            surfaced.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Washington Embassy, he said they were considering Vu
                            Van Thai as a replacement for Khiem and that they had a good man
                            selected for Tokyo. See septel<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">Telegram 3249

                        <p>On April 7 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            delivered an address at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in which,
                            referring to the 17-nation appeal on Vietnam, he set forth U.S. policy
                            regarding the Vietnam conflict. The United States would do “everything

                            points:</p>
                        <p>“1. Recognition of the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people:
                            peace, independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.
                            According to the Geneva Agreements, the U.S. Government must withdraw
                            from South Vietnam all U.S. troops, military personnel and weapons of
                            all kinds, dismantle all U.S. military bases there, cancel its ‘military
                            alliance’ with South Vietnam. It must end its policy of intervention and
                            aggression in South Vietnam. According to the Geneva Agreements, the
                            U.S. Government must stop its acts of war against North Vietnam,
                            completely cease all encroachments on the territory and sovereignty of
                            the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>“2. Pending the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, while Vietnam is still
                            temporarily divided into two zones the military provisions of the <pb xml:id="pg_545" n="545" facs="0577"/>1954 Geneva Agreements on
                            Vietnam must be strictly respected; the two zones must refrain from
                            joining any military alliance with foreign countries, there must be no
                            foreign military bases, troops and military personnel in their
                            respective territory.</p>
                        <p>“3. The internal affairs of South Vietnam must be settled by the South
                            Vietnamese people themselves, in accordance with the programme of the
                            South Vietnam National Front for Liberation, without any foreign
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>“4. The peaceful reunification of Vietnam is to be settled by the
                            Vietnamese people in both zones, without any foreign interference.” (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965</hi>,

                            to re-program funds to the extent possible in order to carry out this

                        <p>Dear Mike:</p>
                        <p>I have been slow in answering your memorandum of March 18<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., White House Central Files, Ex
                                ND 19/CO 312, filed under April 12)</note> and your letter of March
                                24.<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3">
                                <ref target="#d215">Document 215</ref>.</note> They arrived just at
                            the time when I was getting my thoughts in order for the speech on
                            Vietnam which I delivered on April 7. Your memoranda were helpful in
                            that process, just as your eloquent statement of support on the day
                            after the speech was a great help.<note n="4" xml:id="d248fn4">Regarding
                                the President's speech on April 7 and Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>'s statement on April 8,
                                see <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> I know how deeply
                            troubled you have been about the situation in Vietnam, and for that
                            reason your support is all the more welcome.</p>
                        <p>As I read your letter and memorandum, I think there is more agreement
                            than difference between us. Let me comment on a few points where your
                            letter seems to overstate any differences we may have.</p>
                        <p>We have no desire to exercise “a primacy” over what transpires in South
                            Vietnam. Our purpose is rather to prevent the Communists from doing
                            exactly that. Our present limited actions in North Vietnam are caused by
                            the actions of the North Vietnamese and not by any aggressive purpose on
                            our side, in any way, shape, or form.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that I have ever spoken of “unconditional capitulation” of
                            anyone. The exact shape of a settlement that would allow the <pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0580"/>South Vietnamese to work out
                            their own destiny is a matter which cannot be decided at this stage, but
                            I do not think your second paragraph is a precisely accurate description
                            of the terms and conditions set forth in my speech and in our answer to
                            the 17-Nation declaration.</p>
                        <p>I think that the implied criticism of “targets of convenience” in your
                            third paragraph is somewhat unfair. This military phrase is not a
                            perfect one, but all that it means is that along certain carefully
                            defined communication routes, pilots are authorized to attack whatever
                            military targets they encounter.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to what is suggested in your fourth paragraph, we are not
                            opposed to the kind of situation which exists in Burma and Cambodia. Our
                            position is rather that the decision on alignment or non-alignment is
                            one which individual countries should be free to make in the light of
                            their own interests and needs.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I do not agree with the suggestion that the military authorities
                            in Vietnam should have sought my personal approval before making the
                            limited, specific use of riot-control gases which they authorized in an
                            effort to save lives. These episodes have been blown up out of all
                            proportion by critics who do not seem to be troubled by the killing of
                            civilians in city streets by terrorist bombs.</p>
                        <p>You will agree that I should be careful in responding to your specific
                            proposals for future action, simply because of my obligation to maintain
                            freedom of choice as the situation develops. But I want you to know that
                            I am fully alert to the importance of maintaining effective access to
                            American troops in Vietnam, and that by my direction the terms and
                            conditions for discussions leading toward an eventual settlement are
                            under careful and continuous review.</p>
                        <p>For the rest, I will stand on what I said last Wednesday, and I thank you
                            again for your prompt and effective support for that statement.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>3359. For the President. We have just completed another quite favorable
                            week in terms of losses inflicted upon the Viet Cong, 643 of whom were
                            killed in action to 135 on the government side. Binh Dinh Province which
                            was considered to be in critical condition two months ago has now been
                            restored to what might be called normalcy; that is to say, the fear of
                            the loss of major towns appears to be past although a large part of the
                            province remains under Viet Cong control. The success in Binh Dinh is
                            attributable to three factors: a new and aggressive division commander,
                            the commitment of five general reserve battalions to the province, and
                            the improved morale generated by the air actions in the North.</p>
                        <p>We still have the feeling that the Viet Cong are regrouping in the
                            provinces in the northern half of the country and are probably preparing
                            some kind of offensive action. However, there are a few indications that
                            suggest that Viet Cong morale may be dropping. They have given up four
                            major arms caches during the month without a sustained fight and the
                            number of defectors during the week (129 Viet Cong military personnel
                            and 23 political cadre) is the highest defection figure since weekly
                            statistics were initiated in January, 1964.</p>
                        <p>On the manpower side, unaudited figures indicate that government military
                            and paramilitary forces increased by some 10,000 during the month of
                            March of whom two-thirds were volunteers. This rate exceeds the target
                            of 8,000 accessions per month which we had considered the best the
                            government could do with a maximum effort.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> continued his program of
                            provincial visits, making a tour of the Delta area from which he
                            returned full of new ideas and bubbling with enthusiasm. He was quite
                            impressed with the senior officers whom he met in the IV Corps and, as
                            always, enjoyed talking to the country people who assembled to greet
                            him.</p>
                        <p>His principal concern remains the unruly generals and the continued
                            evidence of lack of unity in the senior officers corps. You have
                            probably noted the case of insubordination in the Navy wherein several
                            senior naval officers petitioned the removal of Admiral Cang, the Chief
                            of Naval Operations. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is
                            handling this matter routinely by a board of inquiry but is disturbed by
                            this new evidence of lack of discipline in the armed forces. In his
                            campaign to bring the generals under some kind of <pb xml:id="pg_550" n="550" facs="0582"/>control, he is about to take the step of
                            abolishing the position of commander-in-chief, while increasing the
                            functions of the Minister of National Defense. This is a move in the
                            right direction but his troubles will not end as long as the military
                            command structure is clouded by the presence of the Armed Forces
                            Council. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is fully aware of
                            this problem and intends to resolve it, but slowly and cautiously.</p>
                        <p>Your Johns Hopkins speech and the reply to the 17-nation overture<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document
                                245</ref>.</note> attracted much attention in Saigon where the
                            reaction was generally very favorable. As one might expect, the phrase
                            “unconditional discussion” brought forth considerable editorial comment,
                            but the conclusion was that the term suggested no real difference in
                            aims between the Vietnamese and the United States Government. On two
                            occasions, I have urged Quat to sit down with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> and me to discuss various
                            alternative courses of international political action which may require
                            consideration during the coming weeks and months. He has not responded
                            affirmatively to this suggestion apparently because his own thoughts are
                            not yet in order.</p>
                        <p>The mission has been very busy since my return with all agencies
                            reviewing their programs to see that they are aligned with the recent

                        <p>For more than two months there has been a steady growth in our military
                            presence in South Viet-Nam and in our joint action against North
                            Viet-Nam. These programs are now reaching critical points at which
                            decisions are required about the rate and intensity of our actions in
                            the future, i.e. should these increase, level off at least for a time,
                            or diminish.</p>
                        <p>Pertinent to these decisions are the openings given for discussion by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s speech on
                            April 7 and our April 8 reply to the 17 nation appeal<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note>
                            and some apparent slowing down of Viet Cong initiatives in South
                            Viet-Nam over the last three or four weeks. On the other hand there are
                            the uniformly negative reactions of Hanoi, Peking and Moscow to those
                            openings.</p>
                        <p>There are set forth below some of the questions which have come or are
                            coming to the fore with regard to our future military actions and which
                            should be reviewed on the basis of political as well as military
                            considerations:</p>
                        <p>(1) In the present period how far North should strikes and air recce take
                            place in North Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>Strikes on the Thanh Hoa and Dong Phuong (the latter at latitude 19# 58)
                            Bridge involved us in our first <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>
                            engagement and it may be assumed that strikes further north would
                            increase the likelihood of additional engagements. If strikes proceeded
                            to within about 20 miles of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites
                            (once these are in operation) there could be serious, sharp losses in US
                            aircraft and lives.</p>
                        <p>(2) Should our target lists be expanded to go beyond the strictly
                            military?</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the Thanh Hoa power plant we have confined
                            ourselves to military targets thus far.</p>
                        <p>(3) How close should US aircraft fly to Hainan Island and other ChiCom
                            territory?</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_552" n="552" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>It was the diversionary flight over the Gulf of Tomkin just off Hainan
                            Island last week which resulted in an engagement with Chinese MIGS, the
                            probable penetration of Chinese air space and, thus, the risk of serious
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>(4) Should support forces be deployed now to South Viet-Nam beyond the
                            18–20,000 increase specified in NASM 328?<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in a telegram
                            received April 11<note n="4" xml:id="d250fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> refers to a proposal of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> to increase forces in this category now by
                            approximately 5000 over that agreed ceiling figure.</p>
                        <p>We have by our military action over the past two months certainly made
                            clear to North and South Viet-Nam and the rest of the world our
                            determination to stay the course. We have also given the North
                            Vietnamese pause by demonstrating our ability almost at will to overfly
                            their territory and destroy their facilities and installations. We have
                            heartened the South Vietnamese and seen a modest stabilization of
                            affairs there and some slight improvement in the military situation.
                            Furthermore, since the President's April 7th speech, we have taken
                            enough strong military action to make it clear that the stick will
                            continue in action, even though the carrot has been offered, until there
                            is some real indication of a desire for a satisfactory settlement on
                            Hanoi's part.</p>
                        <p>Having accomplished the foregoing and bearing in mind that our intention
                            has never been to bring unlimited destruction to North Viet-Nam, it
                            seems to me we now should weigh carefully the choices for the future.
                            Should there be a continuation of military operations by and large at
                            their present level, a continued gradual intensification or a
                            diminution?</p>
                        <p>Our prime objectives remain, I presume, to separate Peking and Hanoi, to
                            avoid pressing the Soviets into significant military support of North
                            Viet-Nam, to persuade Hanoi to open meaningful discussions and meanwhile
                            to prevent any further deteriorating, at least, in the South. With these
                            points in mind I would recommend a leveling off of military action for
                            the present. Rolling Thunder II (for period April 16–22) incidentally,
                            corresponds fairly closely with this concept.</p>

                        <p>No memorandum of discussion at the luncheon meeting has been found. One
                            of the decisions reached at the meeting, however, was to deploy
                            immediately the 173d Airborne Brigade to the Bien Hoa-Vung Tau area for
                            security and counterinsurgency combat operations, of which the Joint
                            Chiefs notified <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in telegram

                            decision in view of the understanding reached during his visit to
                            Washington that “we would experiment with the Marines in a
                            counterinsurgency role before bringing in other U.S. contingents.” He
                            recommended that the deployment be delayed until all matters relating to
                            it could be sorted out. Both these messages are in Department of State,

                        <p>On April 14 the Department of Defense drafted a telegram to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> summarizing the decisions
                            reached at a luncheon meeting the previous day. According to a telephone

                        <p>“Sec wondered after he left the luncheon yesterday if it had become clear
                            that all these things were execute orders; he asked if M had seen Max's
                            telegrams. M said he thought that particular cable referred to related
                            to actions before yesterday; it was not clear what the decisions were;
                            they were execute orders subject to clearance with South Viet Nam Govt.
                            Sec said we have some real consultation to do on the Hill, haven't we? M
                            said he thought so but first we should get the clearances with the South
                            Vietnamese Govt so it does not leak from here. M said he would try to
                            pull the pieces together this morning.” (Department of State, Rusk

                        <p>The 6 p.m. meeting referred to was apparently a briefing for certain

                            President made; it was sent to Bill Bundy; maybe Sec could look at it
                            and we could get Sec's views tonight and M would see if the President is
                            of the same mind. M said there was nothing we could get agreement on
                            back here but M had put them on an experimental basis. Sec asked if we
                            had left room for a full consultation with Max. M said no; it is
                            directed to Max; he will not be in favor; a lot of people were not. Sec
                            thought the President should be aware of that, that Max will not be in
                            favor. M said someone has to make a decision. M said we are not doing

                        <p>3384. Recent actions relating to the introduction of US ground forces
                            have tended to create an impression of eagerness in some quarters to
                            deploy forces into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which I find
                            difficult to understand. I should think that for both military and
                            political reasons we should all be most reluctant to tie down
                            Army/Marine units in this country and would do so only after the
                            presentation of the most convincing evidence of the necessity.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_555" n="555" facs="0587"/>
                        <p>Before the Marines had been introduced in the Danang-Phu Bai area, there
                            were at least four reasons for justifying the bringing in of US ground
                            forces, among which was the need to assure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> of our
                            determination to stay in SVN to the finish. Now that the Marines are
                            ashore, that requirement is met and, in my opinion, no more US forces
                            are needed to make that particular point.</p>
                        <p>There remain three arguments for further reinforcements: (1) the need to
                            do essential military tasks which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces are unable to do; (2) the need to do essential military tasks
                            faster than the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, unassisted,
                            are able to do; and (3) the desirability of making provision for
                            possible future crises and contingencies. Singly or in combination,
                            these arguments could be adduced to justify almost unlimited additional
                            deployments of US forces if such deployments did not raise
                            counter-arguments which sooner or later outweigh the three points for
                            the affirmative. The mounting number of foreign troops may sap the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> initiative and turn a defense of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> homeland into what appears a
                            foreign war. The increasing presence of more Americans will give Peking
                            grounds to press military reinforcements on Hanoi. Frictions will grow
                            between the Vietnamese and their white allies; it will become
                            increasingly difficult to steer US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy on parallel lines. The net effect may be not an
                            expediting of victory but its retardation.</p>
                        <p>I mention these countervailing factors to make the point that it is far
                            from an unmitigated advantage to bring in more US forces. A
                            consideration of the disadvantages convinces me that, while logistic
                            preparations should be made now to be able to receive additional forces,
                            the forces themselves should be held outside of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> just as long as possible and until their need is
                            incontrovertible. From a purely military point of view, it is
                            essentially wasteful of the specialized mobility of Marines and airborne
                            troops to commit them prematurely to restricted land areas. Politically,
                            it is undesirable to seek authority for their introduction until a clear
                            and specific need exists which assures them an unreserved welcome from
                            their <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hosts.</p>

                        <p>Bob McNamara may bring over a cable to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> this evening which will rack up a number of
                            instructions to the field to carry out some of the things that were

                            come aboard, but I am not sure that you yourself currently wish to make
                            a firm decision to put another 10,000–15,000 combat troops in Vietnam
                            today. As <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> says, we were
                            planning when he left to use the Marines already on the scene in combat
                            roles and see how that worked. It is not clear that we now need all
                            these additional forces.</p>
                        <p>Your own desire for mixing our Marines with theirs is quite a different

                        <p>On April 14 British Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> came to the United States for a 2-day visit. He
                            spent most of April 14 in New York where he met with, among others, U.N.
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> and
                            Representative to the United Nations <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>. No record of <persName>Wilson</persName>'s
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> has
                            been found.</p>
                        <p>On April 15 <persName>Wilson</persName> flew to Washington where the
                            President met with him at a formal luncheon at the White House. In a
                            memorandum of April 14 to the President, Acting Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> wrote that
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> had indicated he would want to discuss
                            primarily two subjects: the British economic situation and Vietnam. In
                            providing talking points for the President on Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked:</p>
                        <p>“British Government support for U.S. policy in Vietnam has been stronger
                            than that of our other major allies. It has been skillfully conducted
                            and stoutly maintained by the Prime Minister. Criticism of this close
                            identification with U.S. policy was begun by the left wing of the Labor
                            Party but has broadened to include other elements fearful of the
                            possible consequences in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>“Your Johns Hopkins speech, which the British Government praised as being
                            statesmanlike and imaginative, has relieved the pressure of the Prime
                            Minister. His sending of Patrick Gordon Walker, former Foreign
                            Secretary, on an exploratory mission to the Far East has served the same
                            purpose as will his ability to meet with you directly.</p>
                        <p>“You should indicate appreciation for the support the Prime Minister has
                            given us on Vietnam. We have made known our willingness to discuss a
                            peaceful solution but the first reactions from Hanoi and Peking are not
                            encouraging.” (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos to the

                            IX)</p>
                        <p>The White House luncheon began at 1:34 p.m. and also included various
                            Cabinet members, Congressmen, Senators, and members of
                                <persName>Wilson</persName>'s party and the British Embassy. The
                            President's Daily Diary does not indicate when the luncheon ended, but
                            the President, along with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, left Andrews Air Force Base

                        </list>
                        <p>The recent flurry of North Vietnamese policy reflects a change in Hanoi's
                            position on negotiations by allowing that talks are possible after
                            certain principles have been “recognized” as the basis for a settlement.
                            Actually the conditions for settlement enunciated are not new, but
                            heretofore Hanoi has not conceded the possibility of a conference at any
                            remotely reasonable point. For the most part, North Vietnamese spokesmen
                            had simply ignored the subject. This change probably is primarily a
                            reflection of North Vietnamese concern that their intransigence harmed
                            their political position abroad, particularly after President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> offered “unconditional
                            discussions.” However, we cannot rule out that the North Vietnamese
                            desired to test Washington's response in order to establish if there is
                            any basis for negotiations in light of the President's speech. In
                            commenting on that speech, Hanoi has not attacked negotiations per se or
                            in fact directly turned down the offer for “unconditional discussion,”
                            suggesting anew that while the North Vietnamese are not anxious for
                            talks they do not want to preclude possible talks in the future.</p>
                        <p>Recent Statements. On April 12 and 13 the Vietnamese News Agency (VNA)
                            released the text of an address reportedly made on April 8 by Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_PVD1">Pham Van Dong</persName> to the National
                            Assembly. The final portions of this text contained an analysis of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s April 7
                            address and a formulation of North Vietnamese conditions which Dong said
                            must be “recognized” before a Geneva-type conference could be
                                considered.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> (There is evidence to suggest that
                            these portions were added later, perhaps on April 10, providing more
                            time for study of the President's address.) Later on April 13, VNA
                            released the text of a resolution of the Assembly formally approving
                            Dong's formulation. Earlier, on April 9, VNA had released and the Hanoi
                            press had front-paged the text of an April 5 interview given by
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> to the Japanese
                            Communist Party organ, Akahata, in which Ho appeared to lay down more
                            rigid preconditions for negotiations than did Dong three days later. And
                            on April 12 Hanoi released the text of Ho's address on April 10 to the
                            Assembly; it <pb xml:id="pg_559" n="559" facs="0591"/>contained no
                            mention of negotiations but rather basic conditions for a “solution,”
                            which though briefer were like Dong's points. This flurry of activity is
                            confusing and contradictory but the more careful and authoritative
                            formulations seem to us to be those of Dong and the Assembly, rather
                            than that of Ho. The net effect seems to us to be to put Hanoi's stance
                            on negotiations more clearly on record than ever before.</p>
                        <p>Terms for Settlement. Dong laid down his terms under four headings. The
                            first heading includes both US withdrawal and cessation of the air
                            attacks “in strict conformity with the Geneva Agreements” and calls for
                            recognizing the unity of Vietnam; the second asks respect for the
                            “military provisions” of the Geneva Agreements (which are defined only
                            as no military alliances, foreign bases, troops, nor personnel); the
                            third demands settlement of the affairs of South Vietnam “by the South
                            Vietnamese people themselves in accordance with the program of the
                            Front”; and the fourth requires “peaceful reunification without foreign
                            intervention.” All of these terms for settlement have been set forth by
                            Hanoi in recent years.</p>
                        <p>Terms for Negotiations. The new element in Dong's proposals is the
                            acknowledgement that negotiations might be held once these principles
                            were “recognized” as the basis for a settlement. There is no indication
                            of what is meant by “recognized,” of who must “recognize” them or of how
                            rigidly Hanoi might insist on recognition in the form laid down. Though
                            admitting that the two “zones” may remain separate for some time, Hanoi
                            adamantly opposes any suggestion that the Geneva Agreement provided for
                            an independent South Vietnam. It is unclear whether adherence to the
                            military provisions of the 1954 accord is meant to be limited to the
                            provisions mentioned. The military agreement also provided for a
                            cease-fire and regroupment of forces (undoubtedly subsumed by Hanoi
                            under “internal” South Vietnamese affairs) and for international
                            supervision. On the latter point there may be more flexibility, and a
                            few North Vietnamese spokesmen in the past have hinted strongly that a
                            stronger control group might be considered.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi must be aware that at least one condition, acceptance of the
                            program of the Front entailing establishment of a Front-approved
                            coalition regime, would be quite impossible for any US or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> negotiator. The North Vietnamese may
                            feel, however, that in some other form, e.g. Front presence at the
                            negotiating table or the acknowledgement of the possibility of a
                            coalition government, it might eventually be acceptable to Washington
                            and Saigon. The remaining three conditions, while couched in offensive
                            language, are not so different from some US objectives in the area, and
                            Hanoi probably does not feel that it is making it impossible for
                            Washington to come to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>Objective: A More “Reasonable” Stance. We believe that Hanoi has been
                            moved by the current flurry of diplomatic activity and particularly <pb xml:id="pg_560" n="560" facs="0592"/>the President's speech and its
                            favorable international reception. North Vietnam's leaders apparently
                            felt compelled to appear more forthcoming toward negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Previously North Vietnamese spokesmen publicly had either ignored or had
                            indicated opposition to talk about negotiations; privately, particularly
                            after the sustained air strikes began, they showed sensitivity to the
                            possibility that interest might be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
                            Hanoi permitted and even encouraged the erroneous impression that it
                            insisted that no negotiations could begin before US withdrawal had been
                            completed. In fact, in an interview released just after the President's
                            address, <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> came very
                            close to making withdrawal a precondition for talks. He laid down terms
                            which if “carried out” would create conditions for a conference, but he
                            did not state that negotiations were possible “only” if these terms were
                            met.</p>
                        <p>Dong's speech and the National Assembly resolution represent a shift from
                            Ho's stance and strongly suggest that Hanoi now feels that the 17-nation
                                proposal,<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">See <ref target="#d228fn2">footnote 2, Document 228</ref>.</note> President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s speech, and the world
                            reaction have placed them on the defensive. They realize that if world
                            and US domestic opinion is to exert any serious pressure on the US
                            Government to halt the bombings, they must be more forthcoming on
                            negotiations. Whether they will rely entirely on such pressure or would
                            be willing to supplement it by private indications of greater
                            flexibility cannot be determined from these public moves.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi Reaction to Other Proposals. Hanoi has not publicized nor
                            apparently replied formally to other proposals which have been
                            communicated to its officials. In most cases, such as with the 17-nation
                            proposal, the North Vietnamese gave the bearers the standard lecture on
                            US perfidy and then promised to study the plan and reply later. However,
                            in one case, which fits in with the shift in Hanoi's public posture, the
                            Foreign Ministry called in the British Consul-General on April 12 to
                            soften the April 6 refusal to see the former British Foreign Secretary,
                            making sure that the British understood that the door was open for
                            future consultations.</p>
                        <p>Peiping Reaction. Peiping, in a <hi rend="italic">People's Daily</hi>
                            article, has picked up Hanoi's “terms for a settlement” aspect without
                            mentioning negotiations, an interesting indication of possible
                            uneasiness about Hanoi's firmness. Peiping did give extensive play to
                            Ho's “harder” statement and to his Assembly speech, though it also
                            printed the text of the Assembly resolution with its phrases about
                            “political settlement” and convening an international conference.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_DEF1">DEF</gloss> 9164. This is a joint State-Defense
                            message. Highest authority believes the situation in South Vietnam has
                            been deteriorating and that, in addition to actions against the North,
                            something new must be added in the South to achieve victory. As
                            experimental steps to that end, we believe the following actions should
                            be undertaken:</p>
                        <p>1. Experimental encadrement by US forces of South Vietnamese ground
                            troops both to stiffen and increase their effectiveness and also to add
                            to their fire power. Westmoreland will be responsible for developing a
                            detailed plan and submitting through <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for final
                            approval. It is suggested he develop two approaches to be carried out
                            concurrently, one involving integration of a substantial number of US
                            combat personnel (e.g., 50) in each of several <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions (e.g., 10) and the other involving the
                            combined operation of approximately 3 additional Army/Marine battalions
                            with 3 or more South Vietnamese battalions for use in combat operations.
                            (It is recognized that if the South Vietnamese battalions used for this
                            purpose are transferred from a general reserve assignment, it may be
                            necessary to replace them.)</p>
                        <p>2. Introduction of a brigade force into the Bien Hoa-Vung Tau area, both
                            to act as a security force for our installations and also to participate
                            in counter-insurgency combat operations. Westmoreland will develop and
                            submit to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> a plan for the use of these troops in
                            such operations.</p>
                        <p>3. Introduction of battalion or multi-battalion forces into 2 or 3
                            additional locations along the coast, e.g, Qui Nhon. Westmoreland will
                            submit proposals as to number of troops required and location for
                            assignment. The purpose of these deployments will be to experiment
                            further with US forces in a counter-insurgency role, in addition to
                            providing security for the Base.</p>
                        <p>Items 1, 2 and 3 above are designed as initial steps to increase the
                            effectiveness of the counter-guerrilla campaign. If these moves are
                            successful, they should be followed promptly by requests for additional
                            US forces.</p>
                        <p>4. A substantial expansion of Vietnamese recruiting campaign utilizing US
                            recruiting experts, techniques, and procedures. Westmoreland <pb xml:id="pg_562" n="562" facs="0594"/>will work out with the South
                            Vietnamese new recruiting goals and detailed plans for accomplishing
                            them.</p>
                        <p>5. An experimental program providing expanded medical services to the
                            countryside utilizing mobile dispensaries. The Surgeon General of the
                            Army is being directed to work with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> to develop a detailed plan to accomplish this
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>6. An experimental introduction into the provincial government structure
                            of a team of US Army Civil Affairs personnel (or similarly qualified
                            personnel) to assist in the establishment of stable government in the
                            provinces and to initiate and direct the necessary political, economic
                            and security programs. Initially teams should be introduced into 1 or 2
                            provinces. General Peers is being sent to work with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> to develop a detailed plan
                            to accomplish this objective.</p>
                        <p>7. An experimental plan for distribution of food directly to regular and
                            paramilitary personnel and/or their families. General Timmes is being
                            sent to work with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> to
                            develop a detailed plan for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> should discuss
                            above program urgently with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, and assuming favorable reaction, State and Defense
                            will inform Congressional leaders of proposed actions before they are
                            undertaken. Westmoreland should be prepared to discuss his plans for
                            items 1, 2 and 3 with General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> during their discussions in Honolulu next
                            week.</p>

                            has just approved an important cable to you on future military

                        <p>The President has repeatedly emphasized his personal desire for a strong
                            experiment in the encadrement of U.S. troops with Vietnamese. He is also
                            very eager to see prompt experiments in use of energetic teams of U.S.
                            officials in support of provisional [provincial?] governments under
                            unified U.S. leadership. These desires are the source of corresponding
                            paragraphs in our message.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_563" n="563" facs="0595"/>
                        <p>On further troop deployments, President's belief is that current
                            situation requires use of all practicable means of strengthening
                            position in South Vietnam and that additional U.S. troops are important
                            if not decisive reinforcement. He has not seen evidence of negative
                            result of deployments to date, and does not wish to wait any longer than

                            consideration for the fact that, as a result of decisions taken in
                            Washington during my visit, this mission is charged with securing
                            implementation by the two month old Quat govt of a 21-point military
                            program, a 41-point non-military program, a 16-point <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> program and a 12-point <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> program. Now this new cable opens up
                            new vistas of further points as if we can win here somehow on a point
                            score. We are going to stall the machine of govt if we do not declare a
                            moratorium on new programs for at least six months.</p>
                        <p>Next, it shows a far greater willingness to get into the ground war than
                            I had discerned in Washington during my recent trip. Although some
                            additional U.S. forces should probably be introduced after we see how
                            the Marines do in counterinsurgency operations, my own attitude is
                            reflected in Embtel 3384,<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">
                                <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note> which I hope was

                        <p>My greatest concern arises over para 6 reftel which frankly bewilders me.
                            What do the authors of this cable think the mission has been doing over
                            the months and years? We have presumably the best qualified personnel
                            the Washington agencies (State, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) can find
                            working in the provinces seven days a week at precisely the tasks
                            described in para 6. Is it proposed to withdraw these people and replace
                            them by Army civil affairs types operating on the pattern of military
                            occupation? If this is the thought, I would regard such a change in
                            policy (which will gain wide publicity) as disastrous in its likely
                            effects upon pacification in general and on US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations in particular.</p>
                        <p>Mac, can't we be better protected from our friends? I know that everyone
                            wants to help but there's such a thing as killing with kindness. In
                            particular, we want to stay alive here because we think we're
                            winning—and will continue to win unless helped to death.</p>

                        <p>3423. This message undertakes to summarize instructions which I have
                            received over the last ten days with regard to the introduction of third

                            Washington and returned to Saigon with the understanding that the

                            that decision on the several proposals for bringing in more US combat
                            forces and their possible modes of employment was withheld in an

                        <p>Since arriving home, I have received the following instructions and have

                            to introduction of the Marine reinforcements and to an expanded mission
                            for all Marines in Danang-Phu Bai area.</p>

                        <p>April 16. I have just seen State-Defense message <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> 152339 cited above which indicates a favorable attitude
                            toward several possible uses of US combat forces beyond the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decisions of April 2. I am told to
                            discuss these and certain other non-military matters urgently with Quat.
                            The substance of this cable will be addressed in a separate
                                message.<note n="8" xml:id="d259fn8">See <ref target="#d260">Document 260</ref>.</note> I can not raise these matters with
                            Quat without further guidance.</p>
                        <p>Faced with this rapidly changing picture of Washington desires and
                            intentions with regard to the introduction of third country (as well as
                            US) combat forces, I badly need a clarification of our purposes and
                            objectives. Before I can present our case to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, I have to know what that case is and <pb xml:id="pg_566" n="566" facs="0598"/>why. It is not going to be easy
                            to get ready concurrence for the large scale introduction of foreign
                            troops unless the need is clear and explicit.</p>
                        <p>Let me suggest the kind of instruction to the Amb which it would be most
                            helpful to receive for use in presenting to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> what I take to be a new policy of third country
                            participation in ground combat.</p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has completed a thorough review
                            of the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> both in its
                            national and international aspects and has reached certain important
                            conclusions. It feels that in recent weeks there has been a somewhat
                            favorable change in the overall situation as the result of the air
                            attacks on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the relatively small but
                            numerous successes in the field against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the encouraging progress of the Quat govt. However,
                            it is becoming increasingly clear that, in all probability, the primary
                            objective of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of changing the will of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency can not be attained in an acceptable time
                            frame by the methods presently employed. The air campaign in the North
                            must be supplemented by signal successes against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the rough [South] before we can hope
                            to create that frame of mind in Hanoi which will lead to the decisions
                            we seek.</p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have reviewed the military
                            resources which will be available in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            by the end of 1965 and have concluded that even with an attainment of
                            the highest feasible mobilization goals, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> will have insufficient forces to carry out the kind of
                            successful campaign against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> which
                            is considered essential for the purposes discussed above. If the ground
                            war is not to drag into 1966 and even beyond, they consider it necessary
                            to reinforce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground forces with
                            about 20 battalion equivalents in addition to the forces now being
                            recruited in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Since these
                            reinforcements can not be raised by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, they must inevitably come from third country
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>“The USC accepts the validity of this reasoning of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and offers its assistance to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to raise these additional forces for
                            the purpose of bringing the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency
                            to an end in the shortest possible time. We are prepared to bring in
                            additional US ground forces provided we can get a reasonable degree of
                            participation from other third countries. If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will make urgent representations to them, we believe it
                            entirely possible to obtain the following contributions: Korea, one
                            regimental combat team; Australia, one infantry battalion; New Zealand,
                            one battery and one company of tanks; PI, one battalion. If forces of
                            the foregoing magnitude are forthcoming, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to provide the remainder of the combat
                            reinforcements as well as the necessary logistic personnel to support
                            the third country contingents. Also it will use its good offices as
                            desired in assisting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approach to
                            these govts.</p>
                        <p>“You (the Ambassador) will seek the concurrence of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to the foregoing program, recognizing
                            that a large number of questions such as <pb xml:id="pg_567" n="567" facs="0599"/>command relationships, concepts of employment and
                            disposition of forces must be worked out subsequently.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The US Mission Council has reviewed reftel and submits the following
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>2. As a general introductory observation, the Council would first call
                            attention to the large number of programs which were approved for the
                            consideration or implementation following Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s visit to Washington in early
                            April. They include the so-called <persName>Johnson</persName> military
                            program of 21 points, the 41-point non-military program, the <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> program of 16 points and the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> program of 12 points. In the
                            aggregate, they represent far more than the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can digest for months to come and thus have required a
                            thoughtful phasing based upon a consideration of priorities. Any
                            additional programs will have to be fitted into this elaborate framework
                            of activities at the expense of some of low priority which have been
                            previously approved.</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to the urgency of the matters raised in reftel, the
                            Council does not feel that there is a present deterioration in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which warrants taking measures which
                            are not clearly sound and necessary. Rather than a deterioration, we
                            feel that matters are going considerably better since early February
                            when air attacks in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> began.
                            Morale is up; <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> performance is up;
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> continues to do quite
                            well. This is not to say that victory is in sight and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may not be preparing a <pb xml:id="pg_568" n="568" facs="0600"/>new offensive. But we have no
                            feeling of great crisis arising from present developments that requires
                            us to cast aside our present carefully thought-out programs in favor of
                            crash projects of doubtful value. As to specifics, the Council has grave
                            doubts about the individual encadrement proposal raised in paragraph 1,
                            reftel. There are both military and political objections which appear
                            overwhelming, not the least of which is the likely repugnance of the
                            proposal to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. However, we will
                            reserve final comment until Gen Westmoreland prepares a specific plan.
                            The other suggestion in paragraph 1—that US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> combat battalions be brigaded for combat operations—may
                            have merit and has been under intensive study by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> in the context of an international
                            force.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the military measures of paragraphs 2 and 3, assuming that
                            it is the decision of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> that it is
                            necessary to take a major part in the ground combat, the Council concurs
                            in the experiments suggested, provided <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> acquiesces and after <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has organized the necessary logistical support.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnam recruiting program is going well as result of months of
                            effort expended on it. Accessions in March amounted to about 10,000,
                            exceeding the goal of 8,000 which we had believed to be the highest
                            feasible figure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could attain.
                            All the necessary recruiting goals have been worked out as well as plans
                            for accomplishing them. US experts have collaborated in developing them.
                            No further assistance is needed at the moment.</p>
                        <p>The Council favors any practical program of expanded medical services and
                            welcomes the collaboration of the Surgeon General of the Army in its
                            development. In this connection, USOM several weeks ago enthusiastically
                            accepted informal nomination Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> of <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> as Chief, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Public
                            Health Division. In view priority assigned health effort, we request
                            earliest arrival <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We do not understand the proposal contained in para 6. We have in every
                            province teams of US military and civilians who are the best qualified
                            people the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been able to send and
                            who are deeply engaged in “the establishment of stable govt in the
                            provinces and the initiation and direction of necessary political,
                            economic and security programs”. This quoted language describes the
                            pacification mission which is the main business of entire US Mission.
                            The Council sees no need for a large Dept of the Army planning team to
                            work with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>, particularly
                            since other agencies of the mission have important parts of this problem
                            and our current plans are being [garble] to be adequate.</p>
                        <p>As to para 7, we are not aware of any special problem in the feeding of
                            regular and paramilitary personnel; as a matter of fact, the sole
                            program for distribution of subsistence in kind to dependents has
                            recently been abandoned since it was administratively unmanageable and a
                                <pb xml:id="pg_569" n="569" facs="0601"/>monetary supplement
                            substituted therefore. Hence, there is no requirement for sending
                            General Timmes on a planning mission.</p>
                        <p>In general, the Council feels that there is no deficiency in our mission
                            planning. The weakness is in field of execution which will never be
                            better than the level of performance of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. New programs will not of necessity raise that level;
                            unless carefully selected, they may have the opposite effect.</p>
                        <p>Council is deeply concerned that combination of measures proposed reftel
                            will be regarded by Vietnamese as a sharp change in policy and basis for
                            our joint effort with Vietnamese as indeed it appears to us. If we are
                            to build a viable independent nation here, we must continue to press and
                            pro [prod?] Vietnamese on all fronts but realize that in final analysis
                            it is Vietnamese who must run their own affairs. Council foresees many
                            adverse political and psychological repercussions from embarking on many
                            of the actions outlined in reftel. When they become known, our behavior
                            will be widely interpreted as a vote of no confidence in Quat govt and
                            will confirm the fears sometimes voiced that the Americans want to take
                            over and run the affairs of the country without reference to the
                            Vietnamese.</p>

                        <pb xml:id="pg_570" n="570" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>My visit in Da Nang-Hue area included extended visits and informal
                            conversations with all of Senior Marine Officers ashore, visiting all
                            four Battalions in their field positions and talks with officers down to
                            company level.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate considerations both internal and external to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> which impel move on our part to bring
                            this war to successful conclusion as quickly as possible. With this
                            there can be no difference of view. However, I gravely question whether
                            this result can be achieved at this time by massive input of
                            non-Vietnamese military force. As we have learned, we are dealing with
                            volatile and hypersensitive people with strong xenophobic
                            characteristics never far below surface. We have thus far deployed our
                            Marine Battalions to minimize direct contact with local population. This
                            not only from our choice but that of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, especially General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>. On this I think Thi is right. A hasty and
                            ill-conceived deployment of non-Vietnamese forces in combat roles where
                            they are substantially involved with local population could badly
                            back-fire on US and give rise to cries by Buddhists (who are now moving
                            in very favorable direction) and others to “throw out foreigners” and
                            “return Vietnam to Vietnamese”.</p>
                        <p>In next few weeks Marines deployed in Da Nang area will be testing degree
                            to which non-Vietnamese forces can be successful in:</p>
                        <p>(1) Acting as reaction force in situations where <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has already identified enemy and developed an
                            engagement.</p>
                        <p>(2) Patrolling in thinly populated <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> held
                            areas and developing engagements against an enemy who has always shown
                            great skill in avoiding engagements except on his own terms.</p>
                        <p>In spite of urgency of situation I very deeply feel that we should not
                            seek to deploy additional non-Vietnamese combat forces into Vietnam
                            until both we and Vietnamese have an opportunity to observe, digest, and
                            evaluate results which Marines are able to achieve. If Marines are able
                            to achieve substantial results in offensive operations (as opposed to
                            their static security missions which there is no doubt they can perform
                            well) there should be climate here respective [receptive?] to further
                            non-Vietnamese forces which will be able to apply lessons that
                            undoubtedly will be learned from Marine experience. If Marine experience
                            is not favorable presumably other forces will be equally unsuccessful
                            and we may find ourselves caught in a situation in which we have taken
                            on price and problems (both in SVN and elsewhere) of large
                            non-Vietnamese combat force without achieving an offsetting gain. On
                            other hand, if we wait reasonable period of time, say 60 days, until we
                            see how Marines make out we should not lose greatly and may gain
                            much.</p>
                        <p>With respect to para 6 of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> 152339Z it
                            is difficult to conceive of anything more counterproductive than setting
                            up anything in provinces smacking of US Military Govt. If anything,
                            Province Chief is already <pb xml:id="pg_571" n="571" facs="0603"/>smothered with American Advisors and rather than increasing, we should

                            Province Chief and to prevent any suggestions of competition between
                            them, there may be merit in considering appointment from personnel
                            already in Provinces of single Senior American Rep as channel for all
                            American relations with Province Chief. In some cases this might be
                            military officer, and in other cases civilian official. It certainly
                            should not be US military civil affairs officer imposed on top of
                            present American structure in Provinces.</p>

                        <p>On April 17 following a week-long visit to Moscow by the First Secretary
                            of North Vietnam's Communist Party, Le Duan, the Soviet and North
                            Vietnamese Governments issued a joint communiqué in which the Soviet
                            Union promised additional military assistance to North Vietnam. The two
                            countries also criticized President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s Johns Hopkins speech and expressed support for
                            international conferences on Laos and Cambodia. For text of the

                            in mid-March. The Department of State's attitude regarding a Cambodian
                            conference, which had also been proposed through diplomatic channels by
                            the Soviet Government to the British Government, was contained in
                            telegram 2363 to Saigon, April 19. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        </p>
                        <p>We first considered the question of the introduction of additional U.S.
                            and third country combat forces. There was no disagreement in estimating
                            the situation. We all considered that since we could not hope to break
                            the will of Hanoi by bombing alone, we must do better in the campaign
                            against the Viet Cong in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>While conceding that bombing would not do the trick alone, we also did
                            not believe that any combination of pressures could end the situation
                            quickly, certainly not within six months. All favored mounting pressure
                            against the North but no one advocated attacking Hanoi. All believed
                            that the present target system, extended to include northern targets out
                            of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> range, dikes and dams, electric
                            power plants and restrikes on old targets would keep our aviation busy
                            for an almost indefinite period. I stressed that repetition of the same
                            level of attack was in itself a form of escalation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the need for additional U.S. combat troops, in view of the
                            inadequacy of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units presently
                            operational or to become operational in 1965, we agreed on a Phase I
                            which would call for the introduction into <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> of nine U.S. battalions and four third country
                            battalions between now and the end of summer.</p>
                        <p>With the present in-country strength of about 33,000, this reinforcement
                            would bring the U.S. personnel to about 82,000, with something over
                            7,000 third country troops in addition. We recognized that it might be
                            necessary to follow with a Phase II and III which would include a U.S.
                            division, a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division minus and the
                            remainder of the Marine Expeditionary Force. Final totals in that case
                            would be 123,000 U.S. and about 22,000 third country combat forces.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to a new text of instructions for me as Ambassador conforming
                            pretty generally to my previous recommendation.</p>
                        <p>We were generally opposed to the encadrement of U.S. soldiers in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units and to the extensive use of USA
                            civil affairs personnel in the provinces. We supported the concept of an
                            international force, the extended use of mobile dispensaries and a three
                            province test of a new U.S pacification organization.</p>
                        <p>Principal attitudes of interest were (a) desire by certain Chiefs of
                            Staff for a dramatically heightened escalation of bombing (<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> disagreeing); (b) <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> emphasis on need to introduce troops
                            for possible contingencies rather than for primary use in curbing the
                            Viet Cong.</p>

                            that a settlement will come as much or more from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> failure in the South as from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> pain in the North, and that it will take more than six
                            months, perhaps a year or two, to demonstrate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> failure in the South.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to strikes against the North, they all agree that the
                            present tempo is about right, that sufficient increasing pressure is
                            provided by repetition and continuation. All of them envisioned a strike
                            program continuing at least six months, perhaps a year or more, avoiding
                            the Hanoi-Haiphong-Phuc Yen areas during that period. There might be
                            fewer fixed targets, or more restrikes, or more armed reconnaissance
                            missions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            stated what appeared to be a shared view, that it is important not to
                            “kill the hostage” by destroying the North Vietnamese assets inside the
                            “Hanoi do-nut.” They all believe that the strike program is essential to
                            our campaign—both psychologically and physically—but that it cannot be
                            expected to do the job alone. They all considered it very important that
                            strikes against the North be continued during any talks.</p>

                        <p>3. None of them sees a dramatic improvement in the South in the immediate
                            future. Their strategy for “victory”, over time, is to break the will of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by denying them victory. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> put it in terms of a
                            demonstration of Communist impotence, which will lead eventually to a
                            political solution. They see slow improvement in the South, but all
                            emphasized the critical importance of holding on and avoiding—for
                            psychological and morale reasons—a spectacular defeat of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or US forces. And they all suspect that
                            the recent <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> lull is but the quiet
                            before a storm.</p>
                        <p>4. To bolster the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces while they
                            are building up, they all recommend the following deployments in
                            addition to the 2,000 Koreans and 33,500 US troops already in-country
                            (including the 4 Marine battalions at Danang-Hue):</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Points 1, 2, &amp; 3</p>
                        <p>The cable proposed the deployment to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            of approximately 9 additional US battalions and suggested the possible
                            encadrement, on an experimental basis, of a limited number of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>At Honolulu, it was agreed that 9 US battalions should be deployed to
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> (see paragraph 4 above) but
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> states that
                            individual encadrement of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units is
                            neither required nor feasible. He does plan, however, to assign
                            Vietnamese liaison personnel to each independent US platoon and to
                            “brigade” US forces with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops in
                            counter-insurgency actions. Furthermore he proposes a plan for an
                            International Mobile Security Task Force which will contain third
                            country elements as well as <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and US
                            forces. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> will submit
                            a written statement describing the command relationships which will
                            pertain when US ground forces are engaged in offensive combat
                            operations, alone or with Vietnamese or other forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Point 4</p>
                        <p>The cable suggested the use of US recruiting personnel and techniques to
                            accelerate the expansion of the Vietnamese forces.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> stated the
                            mission needs no additional expertise in this area, that the bottlenecks
                            were not in obtaining recruits but rather in training facilities,
                            trainers and leadership. These problems are being surmounted. They
                            expect the strength of the Vietnamese regular and paramilitary forces,
                            including police, to increase by 127,000 men in the next 12 months.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Point 5</p>
                        <p>The cable suggested an experimental program to provide expanded medical
                            services to the countryside, utilizing the assistance of the Surgeon
                            General of the Army.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> welcomes this
                            proposal. The representative of the Surgeon General will be sent to
                            Saigon immediately to work with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to
                            develop a detailed program.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Point 6</p>
                        <p>The cable suggested an experimental introduction into the provincial
                            government structure of a team of US Army civil affairs personnel (or
                            similarly qualified personnel).</p>
                        <p>At Honolulu, it was agreed that it would be wise to experiment in three
                            provinces with full and carefully selected US teams designed to provide
                            ample civil as well as military initiative and advice. It was suggested
                            that in these three provinces the US effort would be put under one
                            person, and that in at least one of the three provinces the person would
                            be a civilian. It is understood that the Ambassador may call on the
                            Defense Department for whatever specialized personnel are required for
                            these three provinces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Point 7</p>
                        <p>The cable proposed an experimental program of food distribution direct to
                            the families of military personnel.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> said that there
                            is no evidence that the regular and paramilitary forces or their
                            families are short of food. They said that an earlier food-distribution
                            plan was abandoned because of corruption and difficulties in
                            administration. It was agreed, however, that the mission would undertake
                            a study to improve the fringe benefits for the forces and their
                            families.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of the meeting was to consider Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s memorandum for the
                            President, 21 April 1965, forwarding the conclusions of his meeting in
                                Honolulu.<note n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">
                                <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> After reading the
                            statement the President asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to explain the reasoning behind the report.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that the
                            deployment of additional U.S. forces is necessary to avoid serious
                            losses of U.S. forces now deployed which he considered inadequate to
                            meet the threat of a Viet Cong attack. Furthermore, committing of U.S.
                            forces to combat would be effective against the Viet Cong and would
                            release <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces for more distant
                            operations. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> proposed a
                            continuation of the strikes against the North at the present tempo. He
                            did not propose extending the area geographically although later in the
                            discussion <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> stated
                            this was a possibility. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            definitely opposed striking industrial targets, power plants, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> centers, or anything in the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong area. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            stated that what he was in effect proposing was to extend the bombing
                            for a protracted period of 6 months or a year or even more, but not to
                            intensify it.</p>
                        <p>The thrust of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            statement and subsequent discussions was to change the purpose of the
                            bombing attacks on North Vietnam from one of causing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to seek a negotiated settlement to one
                            of continual harassment of lines of supply, infiltrations, etc., while
                            the combination of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces and U.S.
                            forces were engaging in defeating the <pb xml:id="pg_579" n="579" facs="0611"/>Viet Cong to such a point that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and other interested Communist States
                            would realize the hopelessness of the Viet Cong effort and therefore
                            would seek a peaceful negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> estimated that he did not expect to move
                            towards political settlement at least for 6 months, and possibly 12
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had briefly reviewed
                            the paper prior to the meeting and that they concurred in the level of
                            bombing effort as outlined in paragraph 2.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated<note n="5" xml:id="d266fn5">According to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                    Bundy</persName>'s notes, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, “This transforms our whole relation to
                                the war. The world reaction will be very difficult.”</note> he
                            thought we were making a major decision and that he was privately
                            exploring an alternative scenario of action which he would like to
                                discuss.<note n="6" xml:id="d266fn6">See <ref target="#d267">Document 267</ref>.</note> He said that he felt there was more
                            room for negotiation than was popularly accepted and that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s “4 points” was, in reality, a signal
                            of a willingness to negotiate. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that the war we are engaged in has very
                            serious risks, i.e. escalation, capsizing of the Saigon government and
                            increased opposition of one sort or another from both the Soviets and
                            the ChiComs (hence he did not feel that the Sino-Soviet differences
                            would be eliminated but rather that they would take independent courses
                            of action in supporting the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>).
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that in his
                            opinion it was totally unrealistic to feel that we could sustain an
                            operation of the type envisaged for a year or two without something of
                            an explosive nature taking place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> pointed out that
                            the program outlined in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> paper is quite different from the course of
                            action heretofore considered, and should be carefully studied. An
                            estimate should be prepared on the reactions in Hanoi, Peking and Moscow
                            to the deployment of American troops in the numbers indicated and
                            committing those troops to military engagement in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He also raised the question of the
                            effect of this new course of action on past estimates of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and Communist reactions. I said the
                            proposed course of action troubled me greatly. I felt that the level of
                            our bombing against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> had undoubtedly
                            inconvenienced and created difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in their
                            supply and infiltration operations but had not brought them to a halt,
                            and I felt a continuation of such bombing could be absorbed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and would stiffen their
                            determination rather than bring them to the conference table. I pointed
                            out that the current estimate<note n="7" xml:id="d266fn7">
                                <ref target="#d268">Document 268</ref>.</note> states that bombing
                            at this level against targets in the southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would result in increased <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activity in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with
                            greater support from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and
                            possibly from the ChiComs. I stated that I could envisage a gradual but
                            deliberate build-up of these forces and that this would present our
                            ground forces with an <pb xml:id="pg_580" n="580" facs="0612"/>increasingly difficult problem requiring more and more troops, that
                            what we were talking about now was merely an early stage in a big
                            effort. I felt we would drift into a combat situation where victory
                            would be dubious and from which we could not extricate ourselves. I
                            agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that the
                            risks and dangers were great and the Saigon government, while appearing
                            better today, was indeed fragile.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if I opposed committing forces, and I responded that
                            I did not, but the commitment of forces must, in my opinion, be
                            accompanied by a more dynamic action against the north. I recommended
                            air strikes against industrial targets, power plants, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> centers, and the taking out of the
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then summarized my
                            views and indicated that the only difference between his views and mine
                            was in the level of effort against the north, and that he felt that
                            strikes against the north should be limited in the manner outlined in
                            paragraph 2 of his memorandum. <persName>Rusk</persName> agreed.<note n="8" xml:id="d266fn8">According to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s notes, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the “situation in South is place
                                for a signal[;] situation in North might bring Chinese in.” The
                                President then asked, “Are we pulling away from our theory that
                                Bombing will turn 'em off?” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded, “That wasn't our theory. We
                                wanted to lift morale; we wanted to push them toward
                                negotiation—we've done that.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President raised the question of the Quat government. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> quoted Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> as stating that <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is more confident than he has
                            been, he feels morale is better, he recognizes dissension within the
                            military but feels there is no coalition of dissident forces which will
                            threaten his government. <persName>Rusk</persName> warned that we are
                            setting a bad example for the Quat government by problems within our own
                            camp and he indicated that the several U.S. organizations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> are not working together and, as a
                            result, the Vietnamese are confused. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that a great deal has been done to
                            straighten out recent problems, details of which were not discussed.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the question of the kind of support we can expect
                            from the U.S. public, the press, friendly countries, world opinion, etc.
                            on the protracted program. He noted the amount of propaganda being
                            directed against us and asked how serious it was. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that we were losing the
                            propaganda war. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            contradicted this view by stating that he thought we were winning public
                            opinion and that criticism appearing here and there did not amount to
                            much. The President insisted that we must improve our propaganda and
                            must do everything necessary to get our message over. He felt that his
                            Baltimore speech<note n="9" xml:id="d266fn9">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> and later statements had had little
                            effect. Both <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                                <persName>Rusk</persName> disagreed with him.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_581" n="581" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>The President questioned whether there is an organized effort within the
                            United States and elsewhere to discredit U.S. efforts in Vietnam and, if
                            so, how would this develop under the proposed plan. He also questioned
                            the effect on our normal friends of continuing the operations plus those
                            which are now planned.</p>
                        <p>The President urged that all take the initiative in the propaganda war to
                            put the Communists on the defensive. He urged that we emphasize the good
                            things that we are doing in every area such as medical, supplies,
                            education, construction, aid, etc., and likewise to emphasize the
                            villainous and cruel things being done by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to meet again on Thursday at 11:00 o'clock<note n="10" xml:id="d266fn10">See <ref target="#d269">Document 269</ref>.</note>
                            to consider the estimate.<note n="11" xml:id="d266fn11">

                                day but that a final decision had been deferred at least a day to
                                allow time to consider an intelligence estimate of “likely Communist
                                views and reactions.” (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27–3

                            they be accepted. The President, however, was non-committal.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting I called the group's attention to the
                            improved casualty ratio, pointing out that for the 4 weeks (Feb. 13 to
                            March 13 '65) <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> killed and missing
                            action—2,132 and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> killed and
                            captured—2,085. However, in the 4-week period March 14 to April 17 (with
                            the days March 28 to April 2nd missing), the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> killed and missing in action were 683 and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> killed and captured 1,893. I stated that
                            we had now analyzed the effect of the bombing within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> as summarized in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>-04463 of 21 April<note n="12" xml:id="d266fn12">Reference is to an intelligence memorandum entitled “Results of

                        </list>
                        <p>I am enclosing the memorandum regarding a possible approach to Vietnamese
                            settlement which we discussed this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">Regarding this meeting, see <ref target="#d266">Document
                                266</ref>.</note> I have dictated it hurriedly this afternoon in
                            order to meet the schedule we agreed upon. For that reason, there are
                            loose ends.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum suggests some moves that we might make to take advantage
                            of what may well be a diplomatic opening provided by the North
                            Vietnamese. I believe that Hanoi, in its answer to the 17 nation
                                declaration,<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">North Vietnam formally
                                rejected the 17-nation proposal in a statement issued on April 19.

                                Office, 1956), pp. 63–65.</note> has put out a feeler—in its
                            peculiar Oriental way—that we should not ignore.</p>
                        <p>I believe further that, if we are to settle this matter short of a major
                            war, we must be prepared for a settlement that falls somewhere short of
                            the goals we have publicly stated, but that still meets our basic
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>I would like to see us move on this promptly—certainly before any final
                            decision for a 150 percent increase in our troop deployment in South
                            Viet-Nam that would multiply our dangers and responsibilities while
                            limiting your freedom of maneuver.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT</p>
                        <p>Should We Try to Move Toward a Vietnamese Settlement Now?</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>The proposed program for increasing our force deployments in South
                            Viet-Nam to over 80,000 requires an important decision of policy. This
                            would be a quantum jump of 150 percent. It could not help but have major
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>A. It would materially change the scale and character of United States
                            involvement in the eyes of both Moscow and Peiping. (Whether it would
                            compel them to increase their involvement is presently being considered
                            by our intelligence community.)</p>
                        <p>B. It would transform the character of the war in world opinion. Our
                            friends—as well as the non-aligned countries—would tend more and more to
                            regard this as a war in which the United States was directly engaging
                            North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>C. It would substantially increase United States' casualties. (Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has made clear that
                            our own casualties will go up at a rate almost directly proportionate to
                            the numbers deployed in South Viet-Nam.)</p>
                        <p>D. It would probably induce Hanoi substantially to step up the rate of
                            infiltration. (This was the view expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> this morning.)</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you postpone the decision for a few days while we
                            consider the possibilities of trying to move toward a settlement within
                            the near future.</p>
                        <p>If we should decide to test the diplomatic water, you may still wish to
                            commit the additional forces only provisionally—with the understanding
                            that deployments might be changed at any time prior to actual landings
                            in South Viet-Nam or that they might be stretched out over a longer time
                            span.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Where We Are Now</p>
                        <p>We have now been bombing the North Vietnamese for ten weeks. We have
                            mounted more than 2,800 sorties—increasing in intensity from 122 per
                            week (February 7–13) to 604 per week (April 16–22). Our estimates show
                            that we have damaged or destroyed 32 targets in Viet-Nam, including all
                            the bridges on Route 1.</p>
                        <p>Deployment of additional United States personnel to date, and
                            announcements of further deployments to follow, have amply shown our
                            determination to assist Saigon.</p>
                        <p>There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> evidence</p>
                        <p>—that these actions have improved morale and increased stability in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>—that the heavy air attacks in the South and air strikes against the
                            North have—at least for the time being—somewhat impaired morale among
                            the Viet Cong and decreased their efficiency.</p>
                        <p>There is no hard evidence that our air strikes have yet halted or slowed
                            down the infiltration efforts of the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>We are on the threshold of a new military situation. From mid-May to
                            mid-September is the rainy season in South Viet-Nam. During that time
                            our air operations against the Viet Cong will be impaired. The free
                            movement of our forces in the interior of the country—whether by air or
                            road transport—will be restricted.</p>
                        <p>Experience shows that this will benefit the Viet Cong, who are far less
                            dependent than the United States and South Viet-Nam on motorized ground
                            and air transport. For example, during the rainy season last July, Viet
                            Cong activity reached record intensity (21 battalion-sized attacks).</p>
                        <p>There is evidence that substantial Viet Cong strength is being
                            concentrated in South Viet-Nam so that it can be used during the rainy
                            season against towns, airfields, etc.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p rend="center">Time to Reappraise Our Situation</p>
                        <p>Now is the time to take a hard look at where we are going. Specifically
                            we should ask ourselves: should we try to set in train a possible
                            diplomatic solution before the rainy season or should we wait until
                            fall?</p>
                        <p>There are arguments each way.</p>
                        <p>On Hanoi's side, the argument for waiting is that, before seriously
                            facing negotiations, they may wish to see whether they can exploit their
                            tactical advantage during the rainy season to achieve a Dien Bien Phu.
                            If <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0617"/>they should succeed in a
                            spectacular way in attacking an isolated point of prominence in the
                            interior (such as Pleiku or Kontum for example) their bargaining
                            position would be substantially improved.</p>
                        <p>On our side the argument for waiting is that, if we can get by the rainy
                            season without permitting the Viet Cong a substantial victory, Hanoi may
                            grow discouraged and be more amenable to a diplomatic solution on terms
                            we could accept.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Risks of Waiting</p>
                        <p>But the risks for us in delaying a settlement are very high.</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot continue to bomb the North and use napalm against South
                            Vietnamese villages without a progressive erosion of our world position.
                            This erosion will be limited if we appear to be moving toward some kind
                            of political solution. But that will take more than words. We have, in
                            my view, passed the point where we can improve our world position more
                            than temporarily by further public statements unless there is evidence
                            of movement towards a political settlement.</p>
                        <p>For, even though we have a good answer, most of the world believes that
                            Hanoi, in its recent statement to the Seventeen Nation Delegation, has
                            substantially caught up with your offer of unconditional discussions.
                            The general world opinion is that we and they have each stated
                            objectives that appear to call for unconditional surrender by the other
                            side.</p>
                        <p>2. I doubt that the American people will be willing to accept
                            substantially increased casualties if the war continues over a
                            substantial period of time and there are no signs of active diplomacy.
                            Distasteful as it is, we must face the hard fact that large and
                            articulate elements in the intellectual community and other segments of
                            United States opinion do not believe in our South Vietnamese policy. In
                            fact, to many Americans our position appears far more ambiguous—and
                            hence far more dubious—than in the Korean War. Until now, the American
                            people have gone along out of their great confidence in you and because
                            United States casualties have been less than a weekend's traffic
                            accidents.</p>
                        <p>But even a doubling of the casualties would begin to make a
                            difference.</p>
                        <p>3. We cannot expect Peiping and Moscow to sit still over a long period
                            while we bomb North Viet-Nam on a systematic basis. Even though we do
                            not escalate our attacks, the pressures within the Communist world for
                            intervention by Peiping and Moscow will almost certainly mount. I do not
                            believe in George Kennan's thesis that our military actions in Viet-Nam
                            will draw the ChiComs and Russians together, but they can generate
                            pressures that will compel each separately to increase its commitments
                            against the United States.</p>

                            international conference “in the pattern of the 1954 Geneva Conference
                            on Vietnam” provided its four-point proposal is recognized as “the basis
                            for the soundest political settlement…” These four points are:</p>
                        <p>“1. Recognition of the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people:
                            peace, independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.
                            According to the Geneva Agreements, the United States Government must
                            withdraw from South Viet-Nam all United States troops, military
                            personnel, and weapons of all kinds, dismantle all United States
                            military bases there, and cancel its military alliance with South
                            Viet-Nam. It must end its policy of intervention and aggression in South
                            Viet-Nam. According to the Geneva Agreements, the United States
                            Government must stop its acts of war against North Viet-Nam, completely
                            cease all encroachments on the territory and sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“2. Pending the peaceful reunification of Viet-Nam, while Viet-Nam is
                            still temporarily divided into two zones, the military provisions of the
                            1959 Geneva Agreements on Viet-Nam must be strictly respected: the two
                            zones must refrain from joining any military alliance with foreign

                                Further Exchanges?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hanoi has set forth these four points for the purpose of staking out a
                            beginning bargaining position just as we have staked out our objective
                            of a completely independent South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_587" n="587" facs="0619"/>
                        <p>We cannot realistically expect Hanoi and the other Communist governments
                            to accept our formally stated objective as a pre-condition to beginning
                            negotiations. They consider it instead as the result we would like to
                            achieve through the negotiating process.</p>
                        <p>By the same token Hanoi obviously does not expect us to accept its four
                            points as a pre-condition to negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The present posture is thus that each side has stated an objective that
                            would represent total capitulation by the other side.</p>
                        <p>If we are to move off dead center we must define for ourselves what we
                            really can accept. In other words, we must separate what we publicly
                            state as our objectives from a realistic definition of the achievable
                            and acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The best approach, it seems to me, is to try to find some common ground
                            that would save face for Hanoi and permit it to pull back even though
                            that action were only tactical and Hanoi hoped to prevail at some later
                            date. In my view such a tactical withdrawal is probably the most we can
                            realistically try to achieve short of totally destroying North
                            Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>There is, in fact, much in Hanoi's four points that we could accept. I
                            think it possible that these four points were deliberately drawn to test
                            the possibility of beginning a dialogue—and we would do well to examine
                            them in that light.</p>
                        <p>Analysis of the Four Points</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Point One</p>
                        <p>Except for “unity”, we can certainly agree to recognize “the basic
                            initial rights of the Vietnamese people—peace, independence,
                            sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.” We cannot, of course,
                            accept “unity” as a basic right—except as it may be brought about by the
                            free act of a South Vietnamese Government once the independence of South
                            Viet-Nam is secure.</p>
                        <p>We have already stated that we will be prepared to withdraw our forces
                            and return to the conditions of the 1954 Geneva Agreements—but only
                            after Hanoi and the Viet Cong have stopped infiltration and
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Point Two</p>
                        <p>We can certainly agree to return to the military provisions of the 1954
                            Agreements pending the peaceful reunification of Viet-Nam. (We must <pb xml:id="pg_588" n="588" facs="0620"/>insist, of course, that
                            reunification can be achieved only by the free act of an independent
                            South Vietnamese Government.)</p>
                        <p>But North Viet-Nam must abide by the same military provisions.</p>
                        <p>We have already made clear that we would not expect South Viet-Nam to
                            enter into any military alliances or to maintain any foreign military
                            bases.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Point Three</p>
                        <p>We can certainly agree that the internal affairs of South Viet-Nam must
                            “be settled by the South Vietnamese people” themselves.</p>
                        <p>But where Point Three sharply diverges from our position is by providing
                            that the political settlement must be “in accordance with the program of
                            the NFLSV” or that it must be achieved without United States
                            assistance.</p>

                        <p>(b) provides that, once the coalition is created, the present
                            constitution of South Viet-Nam would be abolished. A new National

                        <p>From this analysis, it is possible to distill the following common
                            objectives on which we should be able to reach at least verbal agreement
                            with North Viet-Nam:</p>
                        <p>a. Peace</p>
                        <p>b. Independence</p>

                        <p rend="center">What are the Irreducible Differences?</p>
                        <p>In considering the basic differences between our objectives and those of
                            Hanoi we must face up to a fundamental question that could furnish the
                            key to a possible solution:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Would we be prepared under proper conditions to accept
                                the continued presence in South Viet-Nam of native-born Viet Cong
                                and accept their participation in the political processes of the
                                country?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obviously, we would not accept a coalition government of the Russian
                            type. But should we reject an arrangement under which the Front would be
                            given the opportunity—along with all other political parties—to campaign
                            freely but without the use of terror or intimidation for political
                            support among the South Vietnamese people?</p>
                        <p>In my judgment we will ultimately have to settle for something like this
                            unless we are prepared to fight a very big war. I do not believe that we
                            can ever compel the North Vietnamese to agree to the withdrawal of South
                            Vietnamese-born Viet Cong unless we are prepared to go through with the
                            total destruction of North Viet-Nam. Nor do I believe that we can
                            realistically expect to exterminate the Viet Cong in the South without
                            prolonging the struggle over a time span that would be unacceptable to
                            the American people and the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>What might possibly be achieved within the fairly near future is
                            something substantially less but nevertheless good enough—an agreement
                            by Hanoi to what it regards as a tactical pull-back. By this I mean that
                            the North Vietnamese might be prepared to stop the infiltration and the
                            fighting if they could be assured of the continual existence of a Viet
                            Cong party in the South—which, in their view, could ultimately
                            prevail.</p>
                        <p>We could not, of course, agree to any arrangement worked out on these
                            terms without insisting that the Viet Cong units in the South be broken
                            up and that the Viet Cong be absorbed into the national life of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I do not think we should assume a priori that an arrangement of this kind
                            would be impossible to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Those who know much more about South Viet-Nam than I advise me that if a
                            free election could be conducted in South Viet-Nam today the
                            non-Communists would win. If that is not the case then clearly our moral
                            position is not what we claim it to be. Under those circumstances we
                            could not honestly say that we were trying to help the majority of the
                                <pb xml:id="pg_590" n="590" facs="0622"/>South Vietnamese achieve
                            their heart's desire but merely that we were trying to stop the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>But, if I am correct in believing that we could win an election under
                            fair and free conditions, then certainly the United States could improve
                            its posture by making clear to the world that we would—under proper
                            safeguards—accept a democratic test of strength.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Outline of a Possible Settlement</p>
                        <p>The kind of settlement that we may have reason to hope for at the end of
                            the road could contain the following elements:</p>
                        <p>1. All hostilities would be terminated. Hanoi would stop infiltrating men
                            and equipment and the Viet Cong would stop their guerrilla
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>The United States would halt its bombing and both the South Vietnamese
                            and the United States would stop attacking the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>2. The Saigon Government would declare a general amnesty—subject to the
                            faithful carrying out of paragraph 1 by Hanoi and the Viet Cong. As part
                            of the amnesty all Viet Cong wishing to return to the North would be
                            permitted to do so. Transportation would be provided and a regrouping
                            encouraged—but not required—along the lines of that arranged in
                            1954.</p>
                        <p>3. An International Commission would undertake to police the cease-fire
                            by the appropriate deployment of adequate inspection teams at key points
                            throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>4. An agreed future date would be set for elections. The Liberation Front
                            would be recognized as a political party and would be permitted to
                            present candidates and conduct an election campaign by peaceable
                            means.</p>
                        <p>5. An International Force would supervise the elections. Once the new
                            Government was installed the United States would withdraw. However, the
                            new Government would have the right to request assistance from the
                            United States or any other country in the event that its independence
                            were again threatened.</p>
                        <p>6. Reunification would be permitted at a specified future date if desired
                            by the people of South Viet-Nam and their government.</p>

                        <p>There are various tracks that might be followed in order to sound out the
                            North Vietnamese before the rainy season. Certain friendly <pb xml:id="pg_591" n="591" facs="0623"/>nations have in the past been
                            able to gain access to Hanoi—such as the Canadians. Alternatively we
                            might try to use the channel of the Co-Chairmen.</p>
                        <p>We should ask our intermediary—whomever we may select—to approach Hanoi
                            along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. An examination of the American and North Vietnamese statements
                            disclose certain common objectives as set forth on pages 10 and 11
                            above.</p>
                        <p>2. In view of this course of apparent agreement on common objectives a
                            political solution of the South Vietnamese problem ought to be
                            possible—provided the North Vietnamese are sincere in what they say.</p>
                        <p>3. The principal elements of a solution would involve a stopping of the
                            infiltration and a cessation of the fighting on both sides of the
                            demarcation zone. <hi rend="italic">Provided agreement could be reached

                            few months, additional US military forces are introduced into South
                            Vietnam to bring the total US military presence there to approximately
                            80,000 and that these forces will have, as part of their mission, ground
                            combat against Viet Cong troops. We also assume that approximately 5,250
                            Allied non-US combat forces are introduced.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Present Situation.</hi> At present it appears
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, with strong Chinese
                            encouragement, is determined for the present to ride out the <pb xml:id="pg_593" n="593" facs="0625"/> US bombardment. The Viet Cong,
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and Communist China have
                            hardened their attitudes toward negotiations, without categorically
                            excluding the possibility under all conditions. They still consider that
                            the tide is running in favor of the VC, despite the bombings in the
                            South. They apparently calculate that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> can afford further punishment and that, in the
                            meantime, US determination to persist will weaken because of the
                            pressure of international and US domestic opinion, the threat of a
                            broader conflict, and increasing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> air
                            defense capabilities.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviets have exhibited increased concern about the trend of
                            events, and Moscow has indicated a greater interest in negotiations than
                            the other Communists involved. Nevertheless, the others have thus far
                            rejected Moscow's efforts in this direction. In these circumstances the
                            Soviets have been taking a series of steps, each of which increases
                            their involvement and commitment, in an effort to vie with the Chinese
                            as supporters of North Vietnam and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>'s “national liberation struggle.” Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s are almost certainly on the way, and
                            the recent Soviet-DRV communiqué suggests that agreement has been
                            reached on other forms of military assistance as well.</p>
                        <p>3. Non-Communist opinions are influenced primarily by two factors: fears
                            that the war will spread beyond Vietnam, and judgments as to the
                            relative chances of the two sides. On the first point, fears of a larger
                            war are presently not high, but they lie fairly near the surface and
                            work largely against the US. On the second, most world opinion judges
                            that political weakness in Saigon, the success of Viet Cong guerrilla
                            tactics, and the ground predominance of China will eventually lead to
                            Communist victory. Another factor, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> which
                            works in the US favor, is the priority which some governments, notably
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australia, attach to
                            maintaining solidarity with the US in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reactions to A Continuation of Present Courses of
                            Action</p>
                        <p>4. If present US policies continue without the introduction of large
                            additional forces <hi rend="italic">or increased US air effort</hi>, the
                            Communists are likely to hold to their existing policy of seeking
                            victory in the local military struggle in South Vietnam. They will try
                            to intensify that struggle, supporting it with additional men and
                            equipment. At the same time, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> air
                            defenses will be strengthened through Soviet and perhaps Chinese aid. So
                            long as the trend in South Vietnam appears to the Communists to be
                            favorable, however, we doubt that they will open new fronts in
                            Indochina, launch an overt invasion of South Vietnam, or challenge the
                            US in the air in the southern part of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. As to the course of the struggle in South Vietnam itself, in these
                            circumstances we think it unlikely that the Viet Cong and its supporters
                            will come to believe that they can no longer support the war and must
                            make concessions extending beyond the superficial in order to end it.
                                <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594" facs="0626"/>They are more likely to
                            believe that they are prevailing or at least holding their own.</p>
                        <p>6. If these estimates are correct, then some changes in world opinion are
                            likely over the next six to twelve months we are here considering. Fears
                            of a larger war would probably decline, but the conviction of ultimate
                            Communist victory would be strengthened with the passage of time. Under
                            these circumstances, therefore, the outlook is for a decline in support
                            for the US, although the change might not be very great.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Reactions to the Assumed Greater US
                            Involvement</p>
                        <p>7. The assumed US course of action would require the Communists to
                            re-examine their estimates of US intentions. As the buildup of US and
                            other foreign forces became clear, both Communist and non-Communist
                            opinion would probably conclude that the US had taken a firm decision
                            not to accept a military defeat in South Vietnam. Most of those who
                            believed that US policy sought merely to create the minimal conditions
                            for a face-saving withdrawal would abandon this belief. Many people, and
                            in particular the Chinese, might believe that this US decision could be
                            undone at a later stage, but all would perceive at least a temporary
                            reaffirmation and strengthening of the US commitment. However, as it
                            became apparent that US operations against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> were still being conducted on a limited basis, without
                            maximum use of air and naval power, the Communists would be likely to
                            conclude that US determination to prevail had not yet overcome its
                            concern to prevent a widening of the war.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Initial Communist Reactions</p>
                        <p>8. In the circumstances thus created, the Communists might reason that
                            military victory would now become very difficult or perhaps even
                            unattainable. They might think this, not because they expected the new
                            enemy forces rapidly to reverse the tide of battle, but because they
                            feared they would be unable to continue a series of successful local
                            operations and thereby to maintain the morale of the Viet Cong in a
                            prolonged struggle. Additionally, they might infer from the increased US
                            commitment that, if a stalemate persisted, the chances of a subsequent
                            US resort to more aggressive actions were greater.</p>
                        <p>9. Alternatively, the Communists might reason that the new enemy forces
                            would serve only to postpone the ultimate Communist victory. In this,
                            they would be counting on such factors as the capabilities of the Viet
                            Cong, <hi rend="italic">the known aversion to “getting bogged down” in a
                                land war in Asia,</hi> the political vulnerability of the Saigon
                            Government, the pressures of world and domestic US opinion, and the
                            evident unwillingness, at least thus far, of the US to expand the
                            conflict by bombing northern North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>10. Although there would be differences among them in general we believe
                            that the Viet Cong, North Vietnam, and China would initially <pb xml:id="pg_595" n="595" facs="0627"/>respond along the second of
                            these lines of reasoning. Accordingly, they would probably try to offset
                            the new enemy strength by stepping up the insurgency, reinforcing the
                            Viet Cong as necessary with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> men and equipment
                                <hi rend="italic">necessary. They would likely count on time being
                                on their side and try to force the piecemeal engagement of US troops
                                under conditions which might bog them down in jungle warfare, hoping
                                to present the US with a de facto partition of the country.</hi> The
                            Soviet Union would be more inclined to the first line of reasoning but,
                            unless unforseen events had in the meantime produced a major change in
                            post-Khrushchev policy, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                            almost certainly acquiesce in a decision by Hanoi to intensify the
                            struggle.</p>
                        <p>11. There is a third possibility: that Hanoi and Peiping would choose the
                            arrival of major new US forces as the moment for a general showdown.
                            This could involve a large-scale invasion of South Vietnam by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> troops, movements of Chinese forces
                            into the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and movements of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and/or Chinese troops into northern
                            Laos or beyond. We do not believe, however, that they would react in
                            this fashion, at least until they had had a chance to observe how the US
                            intervention had affected the course of the war.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Reactions at a Later Stage</p>
                        <p>12. Subsequent Communist reactions <hi rend="italic">would</hi> depend
                            upon the subsequent course of the struggle in South Vietnam. We cannot
                            estimate how that struggle would evolve after new anti-Communist forces
                            had arrived and the Viet Cong had in turn received new support. In
                            general, however, we believe that the Viet Cong, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and China all rate the staying power
                            of their side as inherently superior to that of their enemies. But the
                            critical factor will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> whether these beliefs are
                            proved in combat <hi rend="italic">validated in terms of the tides of
                                battle, the casualties, and other indicators</hi> with US and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> forces over another six to twelve
                            months of fighting.</p>
                        <p>13. If the Communists concluded that the Viet Cong's military prospects
                            had seriously worsened <hi rend="italic">in spite of the reinforcements
                                noted in paragraph 10</hi> as a result of the US intervention <hi rend="italic">and military successes</hi> then they would face a
                            choice between taking steps to interrupt the conflict or shifting to a
                            large-scale ground offensive along the lines of paragraph 11. In
                            weighing these alternatives, we think they would recognize that by
                            committing ground forces <hi rend="italic">to offensive operations</hi>
                            the US had acquired a greater stake in the war. Moreover, they would
                            probably also recognize that the chances of overrunning South Vietnam in
                            overt military operations had receded, and that if they tried to do this
                            against large US forces, the US probably would not accept defeat without
                            expanding the war to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China,
                            perhaps using nuclear weapons. Thus, we think that, if and when this
                            point is reached, the chances are somewhat better than even that the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China would resort to
                            political moves <hi rend="italic">would seek at least <pb xml:id="pg_596" n="596" facs="0628"/>a temporary political
                                solution</hi> for a time rather than launch a major ground
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is less concerned than the
                            other Communist states to defeat the US in South Vietnam. Its chief
                            motive is to prevent such a defeat from redounding to Chinese credit and
                            its own discredit, to uphold its claims to leadership of the “socialist
                            camp” and the “national liberation movement.” These concerns provide
                            Hanoi with considerable leverage over Moscow, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would probably provide general
                            support and specialized military assistance to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in any of the various levels of
                            conflict here envisaged. But we note that the present level of Soviet
                            involvement in Southeast Asia is a recent policy departure which
                            reverses Khrushchev's tendency toward disengagement, and it is therefore
                            possible that a sharp increase in risk might cause the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to revert to a more aloof
                            posture.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Initial and Subsequent Non-Communist
                            Reactions</p>
                        <p>15. Perhaps the most important non-Communist reactions would be those of
                            the South Vietnamese. These reactions would probably be somewhat
                            ambivalent, <hi rend="italic">that is,</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">On the one hand they would be considerably</hi>
                            encouraged on the one hand but tending <hi rend="italic">by the
                                increased US support; on the other, there would be some tendency,
                                with the passage of time,</hi> to relax efforts on the other because
                            someone else would now do the fighting. The introduction of large
                            numbers of US troops might lend credence to charges that the US had
                            colonialist ambitions in Vietnam and cause a rise in popular support for
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The key determinant, however,
                            would be the effectiveness of the total US effort. If this produced a
                            slackening of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pressures, US-South
                            Vietnamese working relations would be fairly smooth. If, on the
                            contrary, the war looked as if it would drag on with no particular
                            respite from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> pressures, South Vietnamese war weariness and
                            anti-Americanism would probably begin to threaten the US political base
                            in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>16. There would be wide variations, ranging from very positive to very
                            negative, in the reactions of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
                            non-Communist nations to the US course of action assumed here. However,
                            their declarations and moves would, for the most part, tend to be
                            unimportant, since only a few can have, or even hope to have, any
                            noticeable influence on the countries most directly involved in Vietnam.
                            The ultimate effect of developments in Vietnam on US relations with the
                            bulk of these countries would continue to be determined by the eventual
                            success or failure of US policy there and by the degree to which any
                            individual country found itself becoming more deeply embroiled in the
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>17. Major <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, such as Great
                            Britain, West Germany, Canada, and Italy, which have heretofore largely
                            supported US actions, would be almost certain initially to continue this
                            posture. However, their <pb xml:id="pg_597" n="597" facs="0629"/>concern
                            at this further evidence of US willingness to enlarge its commitment,
                            and at the implications for further escalation later on, would enhance
                            existing desires for a negotiated settlement. While Rome and Bonn would
                            be likely to remain passive, London and Ottawa would probably press
                            Washington privately to show greater willingness to start talks with the
                            Communists, while avoiding additional escalating actions, and also
                            devise schemes for a de facto cease-fire or ultimate settlement.
                            Nevertheless, both countries would go very far to avoid an open break
                            with the US and to maintain their lines of communication to US
                            policymakers.</p>
                        <p>18. Such allies as France and Pakistan, which are already negatively
                            oriented to US policies in Vietnam, would deplore the assumed course of
                            action, predict its failure, and step up their moves to mobilize world
                            pressure, primarily on the US, but also on the Communists, to move to
                            the conference table. India's reaction would be similar, though perhaps
                            even more vocally hostile to the US. India and France might also seek to
                            work out joint positions or even new initiatives with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but Pakistan may be more wary of
                            such actions in view of Ayub's recent rebuff in Moscow and of the
                            vulnerability of newly-established ties between Peiping and Karachi.</p>

                        <p>I briefed the group on the April 21st estimate on the probable Communist
                            and world reactions to the proposed U.S. courses of action in <pb xml:id="pg_598" n="598" facs="0630"/>Vietnam.<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">

                            followed the exact wording of the sections of the briefing that are
                            underscored and adjacent to the numbers that appear in the margin of the
                                attached,<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5">Not attached.</note> modifying
                            the wording as appears in ink. With reference to the statement that “We
                            believe the Communists think time and tide is running in their favor,”
                            the President asked whether that was also our own estimate. I responded
                            in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> took some exceptions
                            to my statements concerning world opinion, indicating that he believed
                            that the intransigence of the Communists and their refusal to engage in
                            negotiations would be understood and absorbed by world opinion and
                            therefore world opinion would lean in our direction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated he agreed with
                            the estimate, particularly the appraisal of the present situation in
                            paragraph 1 and the appraisal of the probable ultimate reaction in
                            paragraph 13. He said these two estimates defined our areas of maneuver.
                            I immediately pointed out the implications and the importance of
                            paragraph 10 in the paper and stated that in my opinion the Viet Cong
                            build-up in South Vietnam initiated by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> and Chinese
                            Communists would probably be slow and deliberate and it would be
                            progressive and would always confront us with an increasing demand for
                            men, increasingly serious problems, and increasing casualties. I
                            therefore, urged the group not to overlook the implications in paragraph
                            10.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> stated that Lodge
                            had had satisfactory talks with the Australians and they are willing to
                            provide the brigade indicated in the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> paper. His talks with <persName corresp="#p_MD1">Macapagal</persName> had been satisfactory but
                            there had been no commitment, and the position of Korea had not as yet
                            been determined. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            then stated that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> unanimously
                            supported the April 21st paper.<note n="6" xml:id="d269fn6">
                                <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> He said it was
                            necessary to deploy the additional men and to make preparations for
                            still more men. He made no comment on the tempo of the bombing. He made
                            no appeal for authority to bomb industrial targets, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, power stations, etc. He expressed no
                            concern over the idea that bombing would be carried on over a long
                            period of time and, indeed, the operation itself would go on for a
                            protracted period. He stated there was a need for more air power in
                            South Vietnam because their air power was getting used up.</p>
                        <p>Note (a): His position was diametrically opposite from that taken by
                            Admiral Mustin, Director of Planning for the Joint Chiefs, in his
                            briefing to me 10 days ago. In that briefing the Admiral said that we
                            were using less than 5% of our air power and he strongly advocated
                            bombing the targets which are excluded above.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_599" n="599" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>Note (b): I did not at this point raise the differences as it was obvious
                            that Wheeler's position had changed as a result of the Honolulu
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for Quat's reaction. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that we cannot tell. We assume that he
                            will go along. Some work has to be done with the South Vietnamese
                            military leaders to insure their enthusiastic acceptance of large U.S.
                            and third country forces; that the command structure has to be worked
                            out carefully, but he said no problems. I raised the question of South
                            Vietnam public reaction pointing out that the Vietnamese might feel that
                            the war was being taken off their shoulders and fought by others and
                            therefore they would relax. Also, I pointed out that the lift in morale,
                            if it came about, might be quickly offset by an adverse reaction if the
                            war intensified. Rusk elaborated on my statements, confirming them and
                            supporting the estimate in this regard. Wheeler stated that this did not
                            happen with air and when U.S. air went into action, South Vietnam air
                            stepped up their effort. He also said that General Thi finds no problem
                            with the military brigades now in the first Corps area.</p>
                        <p>The President then made brief reference to the alternative proposal of
                            promoted negotiations and the memorandum prepared by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>

                            by only <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName>Rusk</persName>
                            and no others), and expressed the desire to discuss this subject only
                            with those directly concerned, i.e., State and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed at great length the public reaction and the
                            reaction on the Hill. He complained that no supporting speeches were
                            being made and he felt that our Congressional support was very uncertain
                            and wobbly and we could lose it rapidly. He felt that speeches by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Morse</persName>, Gruening, <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark</persName>, and the statement by Fulbright
                            would have their effect and he exhorted everyone to carry on an intense
                            personal campaign with sympathetic senators and get them on their feet.
                            He also thought that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            and <persName>Rusk</persName> should take every opportunity to make
                            speeches, go on television, etc., and point out the reasonableness of
                            U.S. policy and the ridiculousness of the suggestion that we stop
                            bombing while the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> continue bombing of
                            a type that has been carried on. The President in his remarks, which
                            were extended and quite bitter and directed toward <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                            <persName>Rusk</persName>, to me represented a feeling on the
                            President's part that his chief lieutenants had failed to carry
                            Congressional opinion and public opinion with us. He said his mail was
                            running about 50 to 1 against our policy. All in all he seemed very
                            dissatisfied with the public relations effort. He made some passing
                            reference to my working on certain senators but I made no comment nor
                            did I make a commitment. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWF1">Raborn</persName> suggested that I make a nation-wide television
                            speech. The President did not respond.</p>

                        <p>The meeting adjourned without action on the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> paper. It was obvious that the President wished
                            to give the subject further thought. He wished to get the reaction from
                            South Vietnam. He also wished to explore the diplomatic track prior to
                            making a commitment.<note n="8" xml:id="d269fn8">Following this meeting

                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> 22 April to report in
                            general terms on my visit to Honolulu. I explained that the purpose had
                            been to continue the discussions of certain matters begun during my
                            visit to Washington early in April. These matters related primarily to
                            ways and means of improving the effectiveness of the in-country campaign
                            against the Viet Cong as well as to the improvement of coastal
                            surveillance of infiltration.</p>
                        <p>I reported the concern which was felt over the possibility of a new Viet
                            Cong offensive growing out of the present period of relative quiet. US
                            Chiefs of Staff considered it entirely possible that the in-country Viet
                            Cong might be joined by units of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> and take the initiative in the North. Also, we saw
                            some signs of possible Viet Cong offensive intentions north of Saigon.
                            Our chiefs considered that in order to reverse the trend in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> needed as many as 20 additional battalions. The
                            question was how to obtain this added strength. I asked <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> whether he cared to comment on
                            these matters.</p>
                        <p>Pointedly avoiding any discussion of the possible introduction of US
                            troops to remedy this situation, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> held forth at length on internal improvements which
                            he hoped to make. He is not satisfied with the <pb xml:id="pg_601" n="601" facs="0633"/>aggressiveness of many of his officers. He
                            thinks that many commanders do not pay attention to the needs of their
                            men and thus provide a cause for desertion. He has given thought to
                            raising Nung contingents which he believes are available up to 30,000
                            men. Likewise, he wants to root out the officers working at non-military
                            tasks in the Saigon ministries and send them to the field.</p>
                        <p>I told him that all these measures were excellent and that we should
                            exploit all means to increase <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            strength. However, there were limits to what could be achieved. For
                            example, the shortage of leaders would always be a controlling factor. I
                            also suggested that he discuss with Generals <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> and <persName>Minh</persName>
                            the reduced strength of the general reserve of which five battalions are
                            now pinned down in Binh Dinh province.</p>
                        <p>We mentioned the two documents bearing on sea surveillance which Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had left with him on
                            April 19 (Embtel 3442).<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">Dated April 19.
                                (Ibid.)</note> He said they were now being studied by his staff and
                            that he would respond to them shortly.</p>
                        <p>I informed him of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s visit on 28–29 April,<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">Regarding Lodge's visit, as the President's Special Representative,

                            your own judgment and recommendation, in essentially the following
                            terms:</p>
                        <p>Instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“The Embassy has completed a thorough review of the situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> both in its national and international
                            aspects and has reached certain important conclusions. It feels that in
                            recent weeks there has been a somewhat favorable change in the overall
                            situation as the result of the air attacks on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, the relatively small but numerous successes in the
                            field against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the encouraging
                            progress of the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government.
                            However, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in all probability, the
                            primary objectives of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of changing the will of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency cannot be attained in an
                            acceptable time <pb xml:id="pg_603" n="603" facs="0635"/>frame by the
                            methods presently employed. The air campaign in the North must be
                            supplemented by signal successes against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the South before we can hope to create that frame of
                            mind in Hanoi which will lead to the decisions we seek.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have reviewed the
                            military resources which will be available in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by the end of 1965 and have concluded that even with an
                            attainment of the highest feasible mobilization goals, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> will have insufficient forces to
                            carry out the kind of successful campaign against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> which is considered essential for the
                            purposes discussed above. If the ground war is not to drag indefinitely,
                            they consider it necessary to reinforce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground forces with about 20 or more battalion
                            equivalents in addition to the forces now being recruited in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Since these reinforcements cannot be
                            raised by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, they must inevitably
                            come from US and third country sources.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy accepts the validity of this reasoning of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and subject to your views, I am
                            prepared to recommend to the President that:</p>
                        <p>(1) The US assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to raise these
                            additional forces for the purpose of bringing the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency to an end in the shortest possible time.</p>
                        <p>(2) As part of this effort, the US bring in additional US ground forces.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will make urgent
                            representations at the appropriate time following a schedule agreed with
                            the USG, we believe it may be possible to obtain contributions of the
                            following order: Korea, one regimental combat team; Australia, one
                            infantry battalion; New Zealand, one battery and one company of tanks;
                            PI, one battalion. I would propose that the US provide combat
                            reinforcements of the order of 9 additional battalions distributed among
                            points to be agreed upon, and the necessary logistic personnel to
                            support the third country contingents.</p>
                        <p>You should seek to obtain the support of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to the foregoing program, recognizing that a large
                            number of questions such as command relationships, concepts of
                            employment and disposition of forces must be worked out after
                            Presidential review of your recommendations. At your discretion, you may
                            indicate to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials that if your
                            recommendations are accepted the total US in-country strength would
                            approximate 80,000.</p>
                        <p>You must emphasize to Quat that it is of utmost importance there be no
                            leak or public disclosure of these matters which are of highest military
                            and security importance to North Vietnam as well as to US.</p>
                        <p>You should also tell <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> that if
                            he agrees with the proposed deployments it is not our intention to
                            announce whole program now but rather to announce individual deployments
                            at appropriate times.</p>

                        <p>The following suggestions emerged from our conversations yesterday:<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">See <ref target="#d269fn8">Document 269 and
                                    footnote 8</ref> thereto.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That we should accept the Cambodia Conference<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">See <ref target="#d263">Document 263</ref>.</note>
                            and transmit to Hanoi privately the word that we come prepared to
                            discuss larger issues. The latter, of course, should not be said
                            publicly. We do feel it important to let Hanoi know we are serious. Some
                            key intelligence people believe your Easter statement<note n="4" xml:id="d272fn4">Apparently a reference to the statement read by the
                                President to news correspondents at the <gloss target="#t_LBJ1">LBJ</gloss> Ranch on April 17. (<hi rend="italic">American

                        <p>2. At the same time, and after clearance with Saigon, we should slow down
                            our bombing. We should do this without announcing it simply by
                            suspending raids for two or three days a week in some sort of pattern.
                            We should also let Hanoi know that we are doing this in order to improve
                            the atmosphere for talks.</p>
                        <p>3. We should then prepare for talks in Geneva—which should begin as soon
                            as possible—with a detailed negotiating strategy. The beginning of this
                            is in the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> paper.<note n="5" xml:id="d272fn5">
                                <ref target="#d267">Document 267</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The basic assumption is that we want to get the war to the Conference
                            table. We do not know if Hanoi is willing to negotiate, but we want to
                            make it as easy for them to do so as possible.</p>
                        <p>By slowing down the bombing you are allowing them to talk without looking
                            as if they are being bombed into submission. By not making a public
                            announcement of the bombing let up, you do not get into the position of
                            having to admit the failure of a peace effort if you resume raids. Hanoi
                            will get the message anyway. If it fails we can always leak stories that
                            we tried it and it didn't work.</p>
                        <p>We also agree that the present steady escalation, in the North, will get
                            less and less result for more and more noise. The best way to stop it is
                            to slow down for a while. Then you can buildup again, and have
                            considerable impact without going above the present level.</p>
                        <p>After all, our political message—that we are going to stay—is pretty well
                            understood. Therefore the real purpose of a continuing buildup would be
                            to smash North Vietnam into submission. This kind of an <pb xml:id="pg_605" n="605" facs="0637"/>approach will bring with it a
                            substantial chance of Chinese intervention. Even <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> will probably prefer
                            Chinese intervention to surrender.</p>
                        <p>We should also make a real peace effort before putting in many more
                            ground troops. It is a lot easier to disengage planes than ground
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>It is possible they don't want to negotiate. It may even be probable. But
                            we should give this a try, and in a direct and low key way.</p>

                            sufficient U.S. and third country forces to demonstrate to Hanoi that

                            thought to press problems which will arise as Marines or other U.S.
                            troops move to more active role against Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Officially and on the record mission spokesmen have restricted themselves
                            to language used in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> release of March
                            7, 1965, specifying that “limited mission of Marines will be to relieve
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces now engaged in security
                            duties for action in the pacification program and in offensive role
                            against Communist guerrilla forces.”</p>
                        <p>On background spokesmen have answered affirmatively questions as to
                            whether Marines would (a) fight if attacked and (b) engage in
                            “patrolling in depth” to deepen Danang perimeter defense. With respect
                            to (b) it has been explained that such patrolling in depth is necessary
                            part of Marine primary defensive mission.</p>
                        <p>Speculative stories have appeared here on eventual combat role for
                            Marines. Any additional input of U.S. combat troops will doubtless feed
                            this speculation.</p>
                        <p>(An AP “news analysis” for example, datelined Saigon, April 22, speaks of
                            the eventuality that involvement of U.S. ground troops in combat would
                            raise the question of a joint command. While conceding that such a
                            command “would have little practical effect on relations between the
                            allies”, the article states that it “would be a major diplomatic
                            development <pb xml:id="pg_607" n="607" facs="0639"/>that could spark
                            powerful international reaction.” Further, according to a statement
                            attributed to “Vietnamese civilian and military leaders”, the Vietnamese
                            people would have to be “conditioned” to accept such a situation, and
                            efforts would need to be made to counteract Communist propaganda to the
                            effect that the South Vietnamese Government is the “lackey of American
                            imperialists.”</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances we believe that the most useful approach to
                            press problem is to make no special public announcement to the effect
                            that U.S. ground troops are now engaged in offensive combat operations,
                            but to announce such actions routinely as they occur. As the Marines
                            move from their present posture of securing the Danang airbase “in
                            depth” to actions which can be related only indirectly to Danang,
                            military spokesman will be queried on whether Marine mission has changed
                            and he will answer that, while we never discuss future, current
                            operations speak for themselves. Eventually, of course, fact that
                            Marines or other ground troops are engaged in offensive combat will be
                            officially confirmed. This low-key treatment will not obviate the
                            political and psychological problems mentioned above, but will allow us
                            to handle them undramatically, as a natural consequence of our
                            determination to meet our commitments here.</p>
                        <p>Our treatment, in short, should be patterned on the manner in which we
                            presented the application of U.S. air power against the Viet Cong.</p>

                                Saigon<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                            indicating that “the Viet Cong were going north” in withdrawal
                            paralleling that <pb xml:id="pg_608" n="608" facs="0640"/>of 1954. He
                            raised the question whether this meant the south to the north part of
                            South Vietnam, or north to North Vietnam. I have not seen this cable,
                            nor could I express an opinion on its credibility.</p>
                        <p>Note: I should look at this report immediately and report to
                                <persName>Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. I raised the question of the policy of the April 21st paper<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">
                                <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> on the strikes
                            against North Vietnam and reiterated the views expressed in my letter to

                                2nd<note n="4" xml:id="d275fn4">See the attachment to <ref target="#d234">Document 234</ref>.</note> and the new draft of
                            April 27th<note n="5" xml:id="d275fn5">Apparently a reference to <ref target="#d279">Document 279</ref>.</note> which I intend to send
                            to the President. I pointed out that the philosophy of the April 21st
                            paper changed the purposes of the bombing and that I felt the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could ride out this kind of bombing and
                            if we wanted to bring them to the conference table, we better “tighten
                            the tourniquet”. I said there were no indications they were seriously
                            interested in negotiating on terms acceptable to us and this had been
                            our estimate. <persName>Rusk</persName> said that we could not be sure
                            that carrying the bombing north would bring them to the conference
                            table. I pointed out that the existing extimate<note n="6" xml:id="d275fn6">
                                <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note> was that when the
                            industrial north was threatened, they very probably would seek some form
                            of negotiation. My point was that the April 21st paper brought in a new
                            approach to the war and that adequate estimates of Communist reactions
                            had not been prepared; that the estimate of April 23rd<note n="7" xml:id="d275fn7">Apparently the final version of <ref target="#d268">Document 268</ref>.</note> was a hurried one and was made after
                            the fact. <persName>Rusk</persName> replied that the polices of the
                            April 21st paper were not made hurriedly, that my letter of April 2nd
                            had been thoughtfully considered, and the decision to pursue the war on
                            the basis outlined in the April 21st paper was deliberately make after
                            extended discussions between <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName>Rusk</persName> and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>. I said it would be necessary for me to
                            express my views to the President and I did not think my letter of April
                            2 had been presented to him.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName>Rusk</persName> raised the question of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_Kraft1">Joe Kraft</persName>, newspaperman going to

                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> and I went to see
                            him this afternoon to find out the current status of his thinking on the
                            introduction of international forces. We found that he was full of the
                            subject, having discussed many aspects of the military manpower shortage
                            with Generals <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> and
                                <persName>Minh</persName> over the weekend.</p>
                        <p>He is particularly impressed with the need and possibility of increasing
                            the national effort beyond the present program of 31 additional <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions between July 1965 and
                            March 1966 (the so-called second alternative). He sees numerous
                            possibilities of utilizing certain specially trained regional force
                            soldiers, ex-non-coms dismissed by Diem in the late 1950's, and officers
                            presently assigned to civilian ministries. He also considers that the
                            Nungs and Hoa Hao are capable of producing many more soliders and units
                            than at present. He has charged General <persName>Minh</persName> with
                            looking into these possibilities and of formulating a new program to
                            superimpose on the second alternative. Knowing something of the problem
                            of raising additional forces, I have doubts as to the feasibility of
                            most of <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s ideas, but his
                            enthusiasm is certainly laudable.</p>
                        <p>With regard to additional US forces, we agreed that General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> should contact Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> and
                                <persName>Minh</persName> and work out plans for the following
                            movements: (a) three battalion equivalents to move into Bien Hoa-Vung
                            Tau in early May; (b) three battalion equivalents, followed by three air
                            squadrons, to move into Chu Lai early May; (c) three battalion
                            equivalents to move into Qui Nhon-Nhatrang in mid-June. It is understood
                            that in addition to these US combat forces, there will be substantial
                            numbers of logistic troops brought in to add to the logistic support
                            presently in-country, to provide support for the additional combat
                            forces, and to improve the logistic facilities in the three areas
                            mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>With regard to publicity, it was agreed that, as combat units are about
                            to enter the country, as in the case of the Marines, there will be a <pb xml:id="pg_610" n="610" facs="0642"/>simple announcement made,
                            indicating that the additional forces come at the invitation of the
                            Government of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We then passed to a discussion of third country forces. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> made a fuzzy introduction which
                            led me to believe for a moment that he was going to raise obstacles to
                            non-US foreign troops. However, in a circumlocution which was difficult
                            to follow, he concluded that since it was the position of his Government
                            that the cause of South Vietnam is really the cause of the Free World,
                            it would be entirely consistent for him to accept third country units.
                            He noted in passing that he was aware of our US domestic problem and
                            that the presence of other flags would be of assistance to us.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I felt sure the Australians were prepared to offer a
                            battalion and that Ambassador Anderson would no doubt be seeking an
                            appointment with him shortly. He replied that Anderson was already on
                            his list for callers for tomorrow. He showed some interest in the
                            possibility of a Korean reinforcement but was markedly cool to the
                            thought of additional Philippine forces. We left both matters open with
                            the agreement to obtain Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s impressions of his visits to Seoul and Manila

                        <p>3559. For the President. Upon returning from my visit to Honolulu last
                            week, I found the most active political issue in Saigon was related to
                            the conference on Cambodia and the need to obtain the Vietnamese support
                            for participation. We had anticipated considerable difficulty in
                            presenting this matter and obtaining the support of <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s government. However, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> made matters easier for us by a
                            premature interview given by Foreign Minister Do<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName> made this
                                statement in an interview with a Reuters correspondent on April
                                23.</note> expressing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            willingness to participate in the conference. However, the interview was
                            not fully cleared with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, who showed an understandable reluctance to appear
                            too eager for a conference which might lead to discussions on Viet-Nam.
                            Thus, Patrick Gordon Walker<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3"> Patrick Gordon

                            succeed in his apparent efforts to block attendance at the conference by

                        <p>Although the internal political scene was quiet on the surface, there are
                            continuing indications of unrest among various political groupings who
                            do not find themselves entirely satisfied by the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government. There has so far been
                            little to unite these disparate groups of militant Catholics, some
                            unhappy military leaders, southern regionalists, and the usual “out”
                            politicians. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is well aware
                            of the danger of these malcontents and is trying to placate those of any
                            real importance. He told us April 27<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4">As

                            conditions as he was being pressed at the time by the need to develop a
                            government position on the Cambodian conference. In spite of earlier
                            indications of reluctance to request additional foreign forces,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> received our
                            presentation quite calmly and indicated almost at once his personal
                            concurrence in principle. Our understanding when we broke up was that he
                            would discuss this matter cautiously with his principal military
                            advisors and call us back for a second conference earlier this week.</p>

                            complete concurrence to the introduction of the U.S. and third country

                            would initiate planning at once and I have requested Washington for
                            final approval for the phased introduction of the US troops.<note n="7" xml:id="d277fn7">See <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Insofar as Viet Cong activity during the week was concerned, the lull in
                            activity which has lasted for several weeks continued. The Viet Cong
                            main force units are still avoiding contact with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units and react only when the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> proceed against their controlled
                            areas. While we always try to push the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to take advantage of such a lull to harass and destroy
                            the Viet Cong in their own bases, results in terms of casualties
                            inflicted on the Viet Cong during the week have not been impressive.</p>
                        <p>You may have noticed from previous reports that the term “pacification”
                            has fallen into disrepute as being negative and ill-descriptive of the
                            liberation of the country from the Viet Cong and that “rural
                            reconstruction” has been substituted for it. Regardless of the change of
                            name, progress in this field remains as undramatic as in the past.
                            However, a great deal of work is being expended on the numerous actions
                            programs which were discussed with you during my consultations in
                            Washington earlier this month. Whenever security conditions permit, most
                            of these programs are moving quite well but, unfortunately,
                            reconstruction is hampered by security considerations in many
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p>We may have to seek your help in the matter of the new chancery project
                            which has run into trouble before Congress. You will recall your quick
                            reaction to the bombing of the Embassy in urging and obtaining House
                            authorization for the construction of a new chancery which would be both
                            “permanent” and “dignified”. It has been almost a month since the public
                            announcement of the intention to initiate this construction<note n="8" xml:id="d277fn8">See <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note>
                            but the legislation has, I understand, encountered obstacles in the <pb xml:id="pg_613" n="613" facs="0645"/>Senate. Because of the
                            political and psychological effect here in South Viet-Nam (apart from
                            our urgent need for an efficient and reasonably secure Embassy), it will
                            be most unfortunate if Congressional delays are allowed to blur the
                            impact of your prompt reaction to the bombing of the Embassy.</p>

                            I personally feel this is as far as I can go or, for that matter, as far
                            as the Agency should go in this matter, which is of a strictly policy
                            nature.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I remain concerned, as I have said before to you, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, over the limited scale of
                            air action against North Vietnam which we envision for the next few
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Specifically I feel that we must conduct our bombing attacks in a manner
                            that will begin to hurt North Vietnam badly enough to cause the Hanoi
                            regime to seek a political way out through negotiation rather than
                            expose their economy to increasingly serious levels of destruction. By
                            limiting our attacks to targets like bridges, military installations and
                            lines of communication, in effect we signal to the Communists that our
                            determination to win is significantly modified by our fear of widening
                            the war.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Communists are likely to feel they can afford
                            to accept a considerable amount of bomb damage while they improve their
                            air defenses and step up their insurgency in South Vietnam. If they take
                            this line of action, in the next few months they can present us with an
                            ever-increasing guerrilla war against the reinforced Viet Cong in
                            terrain and circumstances favorable to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>If this situation develops and lasts several months or more, I feel world
                            opinion will turn against us, Communist propaganda will become
                            increasingly effective, and indeed domestic support of our policy may
                            erode.</p>
                        <p>I therefore urge that as we deploy additional troops, which I believe
                            necessary, we concurrently hit the north harder and inflict greater
                            damage. In my opinion, we should strike their petroleum supplies,
                            electric power installations, and air defense installations (including
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites which are now being
                            built). I do not think we have to fear taking on the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s, which after all the ChiNats defeated
                            in 1958 with F-86's and Sidewinders.</p>
                        <p>I am not talking about bombing centers of population or killing innocent
                            people, though there will of course be some casualties. I am proposing
                            to “tighten the tourniquet” on North Vietnam so as to make the
                            Communists pause to weigh the losses they are taking against their
                            prospects for gains. We should make it hard for the Viet Cong to win in
                            the south and simultaneously hard for Hanoi to endure our attacks in the
                            north.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_615" n="615" facs="0647"/>
                        <p>I believe this course of action holds out the greatest promise we can
                            hope for in our effort to attain our ultimate objective of finding a
                            political solution to the Vietnam problem. This view follows logically,
                            it seems to me, from our National Intelligence Estimate of 18 February
                                1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">
                                <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note> which concludes that
                            the Hanoi regime would be more likely than not to make an effort to
                            “secure a respite” by some political move when and if, but not before, a
                            sustained U.S. program of air attacks is damaging important economic or
                            military assets in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I attach a copy of my memorandum of April 2nd,<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">See the attachment to <ref target="#d234">Document

                        <p>1162. For the Ambassador. As a matter of urgency you should approach the
                            Foreign Minister or other appropriate high-level official for a discreet
                            discussion concerning the suggestions which have been made that the US
                            stop its bombing of North Viet-Nam as a contribution to a peaceful
                            settlement of the question. What we are particularly anxious to learn is
                            whether his government, through whatever source or channel, has received
                            any indications as to whether or not a cessation of bombing would cause
                            Hanoi to stop the actions which it is now taking on its side to
                            interfere in South Viet-Nam. It can be added that we have ourselves
                            posed publicly and privately to the other side the question of what
                            would result from a stop in our bombing, and we have had no indication
                            of any response.</p>
                        <p>The reply of the Foreign Minister or other official would be appreciated
                                soonest.<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">In telegram 1373 from Ottawa,
                                May 3, the Embassy reported that the Canadian Government had no
                                evidence that a bombing pause “at this time” would lead Hanoi to
                                negotiate. (Ibid.) On May 4 the Embassies in New Delhi and Paris
                                reported similar responses. (Telegram 3153 from New Delhi and
                                telegram 6239 from Paris; both ibid.) The Embassy in London did not
                                respond directly to the question, but Under Secretary of State Ball
                                was in London May 3–5 for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>

                        <p>On May 4 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> sent a
                            special message to Congress requesting an additional appropriation of
                            $700 million to meet expanding military requirements in Vietnam.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> indicated that the request was intended
                            to cover the remainder of the fiscal year, and added that, “if <pb xml:id="pg_618" n="618" facs="0650"/>our need expands,” he might
                            have to return to Congress for additional funding. (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965</hi>, pages
                            864–868) Congress approved the request within 2 days and

                            on May 7. (Ibid., page 868) On May 18 the White House released the text

                        <p>3645. For the President. The situation was comparatively quiet both on
                            the political and military fronts during the past week. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is proceeding with plans for a
                            reorganization of his cabinet, a desirable action provided that he does
                            not go too far and recreate the image of governmental instability which
                            we are trying to dispel. In eliminating the incompetent, he hopes to
                            strengthen himself politically by bringing in more southerners and thus
                            placating the most important group which is showing dissatisfaction with
                            his government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> also hopes that he is about
                            to get agreement from his generals to dissolve the Armed Forces Council.
                            This, also, is a good thing particularly if it can be done without
                            reopening dissension among the generals. I have the impression that Quat
                            probably could go faster in straightening out the military but is
                            restrained by his instinctive fear of confrontations and tests of
                            strength. Perhaps in the long run this caution will pay.</p>
                        <p>Although Quat has displayed considerable adroitness in handling his
                            opponents, he is not escaping growing criticism in the local press. Some
                            critics complain of corruption and weak officials; some of the need for
                            national elections; others comment on an alleged over-eagerness of the
                            Quat government to consider negotiations with the Communists. Also,
                            there is the chronic impatience over a government which does not <pb xml:id="pg_619" n="619" facs="0651"/>show quick and dramatic
                            successes in a short period of time. One hears all of these rumblings at
                            the moment but we are not inclined to attach too much importance to them
                            yet.</p>
                        <p>I was deeply vexed by the unfortunate border violation in which <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> planes bombed a Cambodian village and
                            thus gave <persName corresp="#p_NS1">Sihanouk</persName> his excuse to
                            break off relations with US and perhaps later grounds for scuttling the
                            Cambodian conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">For text of a May 6

                                <persName corresp="#p_NS1">Sihanouk</persName> was probably
                            inevitable, it is most regrettable that it came about as it did. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is having a
                            thorough investigation made of the violation and we will see that
                            appropriate disciplinary action is taken.</p>
                        <p>The major events of the military week were the arrival of the advance
                            party of the 173rd Airborne Brigade and the announcement that Australia
                            will send a battalion of combat troops to Vietnam. Both announcements
                            were received with enthusiasm and, for the moment, constitute a lift to
                            the local morale. What the eventual effect will be of the presence of so
                            many foreign troops is still unpredictable.</p>
                        <p>There are many sensitivities in this country of which we foreigners are
                            unperfectly aware. Recently, the local press picked up a report that a
                            joint US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> command was being
                            considered which has triggered many adverse comments both in public and
                            in private. A joint command to the Vietnamese means one dominated by the
                            US and such a subordination would be offensive to most Vietnamese.
                            General Westmoreland is thoroughly aware of this sensitivity and will
                            proceed cautiously in suggesting such changes of relationship as may be
                            required by the presence of US ground forces in action.</p>
                        <p>I hope that your attention has been called to the highly successful
                            anti-Viet Cong operation in Kien Hoa Province where the seventh division
                            has just executed an extremely well planned operation. It resulted in
                            the discovery of a large arms and supply cache and the capture of
                            important documents giving considerable information on seaborne
                            infiltration. It may well be that this discovery will be more valuable
                            than the ship we sank at Vung Ro Bay in early March.</p>
                        <p>We enjoyed very much <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot Lodge</persName>'s

                        </list>
                        <p>You asked for our thoughts on the usefulness of the <persName corresp="#p_RSS1">Radhakrishnan</persName> plan for a Vietnam
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The Plan: Originally <persName corresp="#p_RSS1">Radhakrishnan</persName>'s personal inspiration (proposed rather
                            casually last month on receiving a newly accredited diplomat), this plan
                            now has the full support of the Indian Government and should be taken
                            seriously, if for that reason alone.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, the proposals are for (a) cessation of hostilities by both
                            sides in Vietnam; (b) policing of the boundary between North and South
                            Vietnam by an Afro-Asian force; and (c) maintenance of the present
                            boundaries so long as the people concerned desire it. In more recent
                            discussions, the Indians have indicated that (a) “cessation of
                            hostilities” would not interfere with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>'s right and obligation to preserve peace within its
                            borders; (b) the proposal for Afro-Asian troops in the area did not
                            imply a request for concurrent evacuation of U.S. forces (the Indians
                            assume that U.S. forces would “pull back” into camps but would remain in
                            South Vietnam); and (c) the Afro-Asian force would patrol the 17th
                            parallel and also the Cambodian and Lao borders.</p>
                        <p>Status of the Plan: The Indians have now solicited support for this plan
                            in most capitals of Europe, Africa and Asia, with the exception of
                            Karachi, Djakarta, and Peking. They report favorable responses from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TM2">Tito</persName> and Souvanna Phouma; they say that the Soviets find
                            the proposal “interesting” and are ready to “use their influence with
                            Hanoi”. Peking has denounced the plan. The Indians are currently working
                            on the command, recruitment, and financial aspects of the proposed
                            Afro-Asian force; it is envisioned that such troops would come mainly
                            from Japan, Nigeria and the U.A.R. (India is also ready to contribute,
                            but its role has to be worked out so as not to prejudice its position on
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Response: <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> and the
                            Department have privately told the Indians of our interest in the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSS1">Radhakrishnan</persName> initiative. We
                            are not <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621" facs="0653"/>under pressure for an
                            immediate public response, since the Indians themselves believe that the
                            U.S. should refrain from public endorsement until Moscow and Hanoi have
                            made their position clear. However, <persName corresp="#p_BCA1">Bowles</persName> argues that a public statement that we are
                            considering this plan would further demonstrate our reasonableness and
                            flexibility, would help to build up Indian influence vis-à-vis China
                            before the Algiers conference, would increase India's good will towards
                            us at a critical juncture, and would test Hanoi's and Moscow's desire to
                            end the fighting on honorable terms.</p>

                        <p>For the time being, we seem to be playing this one just about right; but
                            we should be ready to move with some speed toward public endorsement if
                            either Moscow or Hanoi makes such a move.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have shown this letter to both the Secretary of Defense<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWF1">Raborn</persName> sent a copy to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on May 6 with a
                                covering note in which he stated that the President had given him a

                                had asked him to comment on it. (Washington National Records Center,
                                    <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 330, <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> Files: FRC 70 A 1265, Vietnam 381)</note> and the
                            Secretary of State. If you wish I will hold further discussions with
                            them to <pb xml:id="pg_622" n="622" facs="0654"/>evolve a paper which
                            will set forth the several views on the enclosed recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Basically, I agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s argument that the courses of action recommended
                            in the Secretary of Defense's memorandum of 21 April<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">
                                <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> are not likely, by
                            themselves, to gain us our present objectives. As I understand it, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> felt that the
                            deployment of additional US troops to South Vietnam should be
                            accompanied by heavier attacks on the more important targets located in
                            northern North Vietnam, though this expansion need not be sudden and
                            dramatic but could be gradual and extend over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>a. Our limited bombing of the North and our present ground force build-up
                            in the South are not likely to exert sufficient pressure on the enemy to
                            cause him to meet our present terms in the foreseeable future. I note
                            very recent evidence which suggests that our military pressures are
                            becoming somewhat more damaging to the enemy within South Vietnam, but I
                            am inclined to doubt that this damage is increasing at a rate which will
                            bring him quickly to the conference table.</p>
                        <p>b. I concur in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>-State view of 21 April<note n="4" xml:id="d286fn4">See <ref target="#d268">Document 268</ref>.</note>
                            that the large-scale introduction of US ground forces will not initially
                            cause the enemy to back off.</p>
                        <p>c. I also concur in the recent intelligence warnings that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may seek some dramatic local victories in
                            South Vietnam (e.g., investment of Da Nang and/or Kontum) in the near
                            future—that is, before the US can accomplish a large ground force
                            build-up</p>
                        <p>d. The envisaged US ground force holding operation will buy time for the
                            Army of the Republic of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>),
                            but it will also give the enemy time to improve his
                            capabilities—including the infiltration of more units of the “People's
                            Army of North Vietnam” (<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>). It is of
                            course possible that the greater US/Government of South Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) military effort on the ground will in
                            time prove overwhelmingly discouraging to the enemy. Given our present
                            course, this question—the anti-guerrilla effectiveness of a greatly
                            expanded US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effort in South
                            Vietnam—will almost certainly prove the key determinant of whether, over
                            a period of some time, we can impel the enemy to meet our terms. The
                            French experience may unduly influence my judgment, but I am impressed
                            with the consideration that if our air attacks against the North are
                            confined within the limits recommended in the Secretary of Defense's
                            memorandum, we will in effect be pressing the conflict on the ground
                            where our capabilities enjoy the least comparative advantage. In these
                            circumstances—and given the enemy's known resolve and skill <pb xml:id="pg_623" n="623" facs="0655"/>concerning attrition tactics
                            over the long term—I am concerned that we will find ourselves pinned
                            down, with little choice left among possible subsequent courses of
                            action: i.e., disengagement at very high cost, or broadening the
                            conflict in quantum jumps.</p>
                        <p>e. In the event that, instead, the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            effort should begin to wear down the Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>), I share the 21 April memorandum's judgment that the
                            chances would be somewhat better than even that the “Democratic Republic
                            of North Vietnam” (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) would seek at
                            least a temporary political solution, rather than launch a major ground
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>I feel that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s
                            recommended course of greater air action against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is based on the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is, in my view, unlikely to
                            engage in meaningful discussions at any time in coming months until US
                            air attacks have begun to damage or destroy its principal economic and
                            military targets. I also concur with the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>'s judgment of 18 February 1965<note n="5" xml:id="d286fn5">See <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note>
                            (the State Department member dissenting) that, given such US punishment,
                            the enemy would be “somewhat more likely” to decide to make some effort
                            to secure a respite, rather than to intensify the struggle further and
                            accept the consequent risks.</p>
                        <p>b. Insofar as possible, we should try to manage any program of expanded
                            bombings in ways which (1) would leave the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> an opportunity to explore negotiations without complete
                            loss of face, (2) would not preclude any Soviet pressures on Hanoi to
                            keep the war from expanding, and (3) would not suddenly produce extreme
                            world pressures against us. In this connection, the timing and
                            circumstances in which the bombings were extended northward could be of
                            critical importance, particularly in light of the fact that there have
                            been some indications of differing views between Moscow, Peiping, and
                            Hanoi. For example, it would probably be advantageous to expand bombings
                            after, not before, some major new <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> move
                            (e.g. obvious concentration for imminent attack on Da Nang or Kontum)
                            and after, not before, any current possibilities of serious negotiations
                            have been fully tested. And such bombings should not be so regular as to
                            leave no interval for the Communists to make concessions with some
                            grace. Indeed, we should keep in mind the possibility of a pause at some
                            appropriate time, which could serve to test the Communist intentions and
                            to exploit any differences on their side.</p>
                        <p>We must not of course get overly preoccupied with military action and
                            lose sight of the basically political aspect of the war. In the final
                            analysis, it can only be won at the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            hamlet level.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_624" n="624" facs="0656"/>
                        <p>This will thus entail certain measures over and above greater military
                            commitment and expanded punishment of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The most imperative of these are:</p>
                        <p>a. Creating effective administrative, police, and local defense
                            instrumentalities at the hamlet level.</p>
                        <p>b. Making US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military measures
                            support a growth of indigenous civilian political authority and serve
                            legitimate local and national aspirations.</p>
                        <p>c. Expanding such political, economic, and sociological efforts as will
                            close the gap between Saigon governments and the South Vietnamese
                            population.</p>
                        <p>The expanded air attacks on North Vietnam, judiciously exercised, are not
                            expected to result in large-scale Chinese Communist intervention by
                            ground forces in Vietnam or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, as long as the
                            Chinese do not believe their vital security interest is threatened by US
                            actions. In other words, the chances of such actions are less than even,
                            but should not be wholly excluded.<note n="6" xml:id="d286fn6">A note on

                        <p rend="center">THE PRESIDENT DATED 8 MAY 1965</p>
                        <p>I. The current programs for our air strikes against North Vietnam, as I
                            understand them, limit the targets to such objectives as bridges,
                            military installations, and lines of communication, avoiding targets in
                            populated areas or within the “effective GCI range” of <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> jet fighters.</p>
                        <p>A. I do not believe that an air strike program operating under these
                            restrictions is going to hurt the North Vietnamese enough to persuade
                            Hanoi to end its support of the guerrillas in South Vietnam, or even to
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_625" n="625" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>1. We have some recent evidence that the intensification of our air
                            strikes is disrupting the economy and the every-day life of the North
                            Vietnamese, but the strikes to date have not caused any change in the
                            North Vietnamese policy of directing the Viet Cong insurgency,
                            infiltrating cadres, and supplying materiel.</p>
                        <p>2. If anything, the strikes to date appear to have hardened Hanoi's
                            attitude. By now the North Vietnamese may well have discerned for
                            themselves the restraints under which the Rolling Thunder operations are
                            conducted. They are likely to read this as evidence of a U.S. desire to
                            temporize.</p>
                        <p>3. In these circumstances, the Communists will probably feel that they
                            can afford to accept a considerable amount of bomb damage while they
                            improve their air defenses and intensify the insurgency in South
                            Vietnam. If they do this, we face the prospect over the next few months
                            of an ever-increasing war against a reinforced Viet Cong, in terrain and
                            under circumstances favorable to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>4. Another hazard that must be kept in mind when we speak in terms of a
                            “slowly ascending tempo” for Rolling Thunder is that with the passage of
                            each day and each week, we can expect increasing pressure to stop the
                            bombing. This pressure will come from various elements of the American
                            public, from the press, from the United Nations, and from world opinion.
                            Under these restraints, time is running against us. The Communists not
                            only know this and count on it, but are doing what they can to further
                            the pressure.</p>
                        <p>B. We are changing the mission of our ground forces in South Vietnam from
                            one of advice and static defense to one of active combat operations
                            against the Viet Cong guerrillas, and to do this we are deploying
                            additional troops.</p>
                        <p>1. I think what we are doing is starting on a track involving ground
                            force operations, which is necessary, and which will restrain some Viet
                            Cong advances, but a track which—in all probability—will have limited
                            effectiveness against guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>2. We can expect requirements for an ever-increasing commitment of U.S.
                            personnel, but we cannot reasonably predict that this will materially
                            improve the chances for victory. In the final analysis, the submission
                            of the Viet Cong can only be brought about by forcing Hanoi to the
                            necessary decision.</p>
                        <p>3. As long as our actions against North Vietnam do not impose
                            unacceptable damage nor threaten the vital interests of North Vietnam, I
                            believe that the new ground operations in the South carry the risk of
                            simply encouraging Moscow and Peiping to support Hanoi. They are likely
                            to conclude that the risk to them is minimal.</p>
                        <p>4. As I see it, the reaction of the North Vietnamese and Chinese
                            Communists will be to build up the capabilities of the Viet Cong
                            deliberately, <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0658"/>carefully, and
                            probably gradually, by the covert infiltration of North Vietnamese and
                            possibly Chinese reinforcements. We will, in effect, find ourselves
                            pressing the fight on the ground, in the jungle, where our capabilities
                            have the least comparative advantage. We may become bogged down in a
                            military effort which we cannot win, and from which we cannot easily
                            extricate ourselves.</p>
                        <p>II. It is my judgment that if we are to change the mission of the ground
                            forces, we must also change the rules for the air strikes against North
                            Vietnam. We must hit them harder and more frequently, and inflict
                            greater damage. If we are not willing to do this, I question seriously
                            whether it is wise to become more deeply involved in the ground
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>A. Specifically, I feel that we must carry on the air strike in a manner
                            that will begin to hurt North Vietnam badly enough so that Hanoi will
                            prefer negotiation, in search for a political way out, rather than
                            exposure of its economy to increasingly severe levels of
                            destruction.</p>
                        <p>B. I feel we must hit their petroleum supplies and their electric power
                            installations. We should knock out their air defense installations,
                            including any surface-to-air missile sites we can find under
                            construction or completed. We should not avoid their <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> fighters, but go after them. I do not
                            think we need to fear taking on <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s
                            which, after all, the Chinese Nationalists defeated badly in 1958 with
                            F-86's.</p>
                        <p>C. I am not talking about bombing centers of population per se, and
                            killing civilians who are not involved. There will, of course, be some
                            casualties, but what I am proposing is to “tighten the tourniquet” on
                            North Vietnam, to multiply the damage to the military and economic
                            fabric of their society so that they will have to measure the actual
                            loss against the long-term prospect for gains.</p>
                        <p>1. There is probably room for some leeway in the timing of this expanded
                            air strike program. For example, it would probably be advantageous to
                            launch it after, rather than before some major new Viet Cong move, such
                            as obvious concentration for an attack on Da Nang or Kontum.</p>
                        <p>2. I feel it might also be wise if the pace of the expanded air strikes
                            were irregular enough so that there would be intervals from time to time
                            when the Communists could move toward the negotiating tables without
                            total loss of face—not out of any consideration for their sensitivities,
                            but because this is, after all, what we desire.</p>
                        <p>3. I do feel, however, that this new program—including the “timing”
                            element—must be taken promptly. If it is implemented too gradually, then
                            we will not only face the increasing pressures of domestic, allied and
                            world opinion which I mentioned before, but there is also some danger
                            that the Communists will be slow to get the message.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0659"/>
                        <p>III. I believe this course of action holds out the greatest hope there is
                            for our ultimate objective of finding a political solution to the
                            Vietnam problem. If we only make it hard for the enemy in the South, we
                            are not bringing effective pressure to bear on his commander in the
                            North. Hanoi, in my view, is not likely to engage in meaningful
                            discussions at any time in coming months, if U.S. air attacks have not
                            yet begun to damage or destroy its principal economic and military
                            targets, which are overwhelmingly in the northern portion of North
                            Vietnam, beyond the scope of our present strikes.</p>
                        <p>A. The Intelligence Community, less the Department of State, is in
                            agreement, however, that the Hanoi regime would be more likely than not
                            to seek a respite by some political move when and if—but not before—a
                            sustained program of U.S. air strikes is damaging important economic and
                            military assets in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>B. I think we have got to proceed forthwith to fulfill this condition,
                            and hit the North Vietnamese where it really hurts.</p>

                            Ball explained that the plan was based upon the collective but
                            provisional thinking of a group which included himself, <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Leonard Unger</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_WAS1">Allen</persName> Whiting in the Department of

                            regarding a possible move toward a Vietnam settlement.” He noted that
                            the paper was being substantially revised to incorporate ideas suggested
                            by <persName corresp="#p_CGA1">George Carver</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s memoirs, the

                            President expressed interest in Ball's ideas and conveyed, through
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> Moyers, a request for

                                Ehrlich</persName>, to Saigon to discuss the report with Ambassador

                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. They responded on
                            May 20 with two papers which indicated serious reservations about the
                            plan (<ref target="#d309">Documents 309</ref> and <ref target="#d310">310</ref>). <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> attempted
                            to answer their comments in telegram 2685 to Saigon, May 25. (Department
                            of State, Central Files, POL 27–14 VIET S) In an unpublished manuscript,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> noted that
                            after the Embassy's criticism of the plan it dropped out of the
                            mainstream of policy consideration, at least until late 1966.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that the plan “was probably the
                            most judicious compromise solution that could have been devised,” but
                            added that it required a “more sophisticated and appealing Saigon
                            government than was in existence at any time after late May 1965,” and
                            based upon favorable military trends that proved by late May to be
                            illusory. (Johnson Library, Papers of William Bundy, Chapter 24, page

                            the President. I have learned from Bob McNamara that nearly all Rolling
                            Thunder operations for this week can be completed by Wednesday noon,
                            Washington time.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">May 12.</note> This fact
                            and the days of Buddha's birthday seem to me to provide an excellent
                            opportunity for a pause in air attacks which might go into next week and
                            which I could use to good effect with world opinion.</p>
                        <p>My plan is not to announce this brief pause but simply to call it
                            privately to the attention of Moscow and Hanoi as soon as possible, and
                            tell them that we shall be watching closely to see whether they respond
                            in any way. My current plan is to report publicly after the pause ends
                            on what we have done.</p>
                        <p>Could you see Quat right away on Tuesday and see if you can persuade him
                            to concur in this plan. I would like to associate him with me in this
                            decision if possible, but I would accept a simple concurrence or even a
                            willingness not to oppose my decision. In general, I think it important
                            that he and I should act together in such matters, but I have no desire
                            to embarrass him if it is politically difficult for him to join actively
                            in a pause over Buddha's birthday.</p>

                                1 he had asked Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> whether he saw any merit in the suggestion that
                                there be a pause in air attacks during the celebration of Buddha's
                                birthday. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> responded
                                that Buddha's birthday was not a national holiday akin to Tet, and
                                he did not see any merit in such a suggestion. (Department of State,

                                people. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET

                            effect in Saigon of acting around Buddha's <pb xml:id="pg_630" n="630" facs="0662"/>birthday. From my point of view it is a great advantage
                            to use Buddha's birthday to mask the first days of the pause here, if it
                            is at all possible in political terms for Quat. I assume we could
                            undertake to enlist the Archbishop and the Nuncio in calming the
                            Catholics.</p>
                        <p>You should understand that my purpose in this plan is to begin to clear a
                            path either toward restoration of peace or toward increased military
                            action, depending upon the reaction of the Communists. We have amply
                            demonstrated our determination and our commitment in the last two
                            months, and I now wish to gain some flexibility.</p>

                        <p>I have kept this plan in the tightest possible circle here and wish you

                        <p>Part I</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> and I called on Quat
                            this afternoon to take up matter raised in reftel. We explained feeling
                            in Washington that there was need to vary pattern of our activity
                            vis-à-vis Hanoi and give more flexibility to our operations. To this
                            end, consideration was being given to pause of several days duration in
                            air attacks against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> which, it seemed
                            to us, would offer several advantages. Such action would be viewed
                            favorably by world opinion as an indication of our reluctance to proceed
                            too rapidly in applying <pb xml:id="pg_631" n="631" facs="0663"/>military pressures. It would also provide an opportunity to observe
                            reaction of Hanoi leaders who are unlikely to respond other than with
                            defiance while attacks are in process. Finally, we could anticipate some
                            psychological effect deriving from quiet of several days of suspended
                            action followed, if required, by resumption of attacks.</p>
                        <p>After pointing out advantages, we noted danger of misinterpretation and
                            need for plausible reason for timing of our action. We said that
                            observance of Buddha's birthday offered convenient peg upon which to
                            hang our proposed action. We knew that from previous discussions Quat
                            had not favored anything resembling cease-fire related to this period
                            but we were raising matter again in an entirely different context.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> did not take issue with
                            arguments in favor of pause of limited duration. He did suggest,
                            however, that pause be introduced progressively, one day of air activity
                            followed by another of quiet. I objected that this kind of pattern would
                            not fully meet any of three purposes which we considered to justify
                            suspension of air activity. He abandoned argument without much
                            reluctance and indicated general agreement with pause concept (four or
                            five days only) except for linkage with Buddha's birthday. He feels
                            strongly that we should not publicly advance this occasion as reason for
                            our action. To do so would cause him difficulty with local Catholics and
                            would be embarrassing in other respects since his govt has declined to
                            give official recognition and support to birthday period. Finally, he
                            pointed out that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>
                            was alleged to have pursued pro-Buddhist policy and that he felt
                            Americans would give support to this allegation if we justified pause on
                            Buddha's birthday.</p>
                        <p>Without such pretext, we asked him how we could respond to inevitable
                            press queries as to reason for lack of air activity. He said that this
                            would cause him no difficulty as he and his spokesmen would simply
                            respond that this matter of strategy about which they would make no
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>While I did not mention plan to call suspension of air activities
                            privately to attention of Moscow and Hanoi, I did comment on need of
                            clear understanding of our motives on part of Communists and mentioned
                            that it may be necessary to enter into some kind of communication with
                            them on subject. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> accepted
                            this remark without comment.</p>
                        <p>In summary, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> concurs in
                            concept of pause from four to not more than five days provided there is
                            no public linking of this action with Buddha's birthday. If speculation
                            assumes this linkage, he would not try to dispel impression but would
                            give no verification. <persName>Johnson</persName> and I recommend that
                            we respect his objections and adjust our plans in consonance with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Part II</p>
                        <p>If decision is made to proceed with pause, we shall need additional
                            guidance with regard to our public relations attitude. The following are
                                <pb xml:id="pg_632" n="632" facs="0664"/>some of factors which will
                            have to be taken into account. (Some do not apply if we follow Quat's
                            views with regard to Buddha's birthday.)</p>
                        <p>1. As pattern of daily announcements and briefings on air actions against
                            North now established here and elsewhere, absence of announcement will
                            immediately be noted and queries made as to reason.</p>
                        <p>2. Bonze Khiet's request for “cessation of attacks” is only for period
                            0000 hours to 2400 hours May 15. If we use birthday as pretext for pause
                            of several days, we appear more Buddhist than venerable.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> will have to give some
                            reasons for pause to his generals and something as to true motives can
                            be expected to leak fairly promptly to press.</p>
                        <p>4. Press can be expected to probe hard to learn whether initiative for
                            pause came from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and, if latter, whether from Saigon or
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Initially, press can be expected to perceive connection between pause and
                            Buddha's birthday but to extent that pause extends beyond May 15
                            speculation as to other reasons can be expected to become intense both
                            in local and international press, and correspondents will hound every
                            possible source. Our refusal to answer questions here and well-known
                            fact that Washington issues instructions on strikes can be expected to
                            divert much of press pressure to Washington. We hope that as situation
                            develops we can be kept fully informed on how matter being handled
                            Washington, including all backgrounders, so that we and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can keep in step.</p>

                        <p>3727. For the President. The big event of the political week was the
                            voluntary dissolution of the Armed Forces Council by the generals who
                            composed it. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> gets the

                            solution. We feel that it is a most happy development as the
                            disappearance of the Armed Forces Council removes a mechanism which
                            invited the generals to interfere with civilian government and engage in
                            politics.</p>

                            his place. In view of the paucity of able generals for the senior
                            positions, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> may end up with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THIEU1">Thieu</persName> as both Minister
                            of Defense and Commander-in-Chief. Organizationally this focusing of
                            responsibility offers some advantages but it is also a dangerous
                            concentration of power in one officer whose character is untested.</p>
                        <p>Our two latest U.S. reinforcements, the 173rd Airborne Brigade and the
                            Marine battalions for the Chu Lai Airfield, have arrived and are rapidly
                            shaking down in their defensive positions. The impression of
                            professional alertness and competence which they convey has had a good
                            effect on all who see them but the future will hold problems in this
                            regard. If they are not actively employed shortly, I suspect boredom is
                            going to be a major factor to preoccupy their commanders. There is some
                            limit on the useful work which could be done within their defensive
                            perimeters.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong raised the tempo of their activity somewhat during the past
                            week, particularly in the Mekong Delta region. There they committed a
                            Viet Cong battalion to battle, the first time since March 8 that a unit
                            of this size has been engaged. I have the feeling that the period of
                            relative inaction is over and that the Viet Cong offensive may be under
                            way. It may take the form of a large number of small actions rather than
                            of the large headline filling types which the press is anticipating.</p>
                        <p>There is considerable action under way in preparation of the municipal
                            and provincial elections which are scheduled for May 20. With their
                            approach, the Vietnamese press has been paying greater attention to the
                            need for elections for a National Assembly. Many of the editors show
                            more fervor than good sense in urging general elections under the
                            present conditions of insecurity in many provinces. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is thoroughly aware of what is
                            realistic and can be counted upon keeping this enthusiasm within bounds.
                            Incidentally, there is a higher interest in standing <pb xml:id="pg_634" n="634" facs="0666"/>for office in the municipal and provincial
                            elections than we had anticipated. We are told that there is an average
                            of five candidates for each provincial council seat and nine for each
                            municipal seat, a competition which is double that of previous
                            elections. Working for the government appears to be gaining in
                            appeal.</p>

                        <p>Up to this moment, the knowledge of the President's plan for a trial
                            pause has been restricted to the President himself and to those
                            addressed in this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The President now approves the extension of this circle to include in the

                            private transmission of the existence of his plan to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>, Prime Minister

                            this time to anyone but his Foreign Minister. The President has himself
                            informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in Saigon, and
                            he now authorizes a message to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> instructing him to inform General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">See <ref target="#d288">Documents 288</ref> and

                        <p>The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense to carry out the
                            military aspects of this plan.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this point, the President has given no authorization whatever for
                            any discussion or disclosure of this plan by anyone at any time with
                            anyone inside or outside the Government. The President has directed me
                            to emphasize the importance of complete discretion among those who are
                            authorized to be informed, and he asks me to impress upon the Secretary
                            of Defense and upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName>, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s absence, the importance of insuring complete
                            discretion in the State and Defense Departments. Needless to say, he has
                            given me a similar caution with respect to the White House, and he omits
                            this warning in the case of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RWF1">Raborn</persName> simply because he expects that no other office of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will be informed at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>This operation needs a code word and the best that I can think of is
                            Holiday.</p>

                        <p>You should make earliest possible arrangement see <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador Moscow to convey parallel message as set
                            forth below. We are using you as channel to avoid using Soviets as
                            intermediaries and also to insure that message is accurately and
                            directly delivered. We leave appropriate method of arranging contact to
                            you and are not concerned if Soviets should become aware you are making
                            such contact. You should of course make maximum effort avoid any
                            attention by any third party.</p>
                        <p>Message you should deliver should be oral but confirmed by written piece
                            of paper which you should hand to Ambassador with request he deliver
                            message to Hanoi. Message is as follows:</p>
                        <p>Begin text. The highest authority in this Government has asked me to
                            inform Hanoi that there will be no air attacks on North Viet-Nam for a
                            period beginning at noon, Washington time, Wednesday, May 12, and
                            running into next week.</p>
                        <p>In this decision the United States Government has taken account of
                            repeated suggestions from various quarters, including public statements
                                <pb xml:id="pg_638" n="638" facs="0670"/>by Hanoi representatives,
                            that there can be no progress toward peace while there are air attacks
                            on North Viet-Nam. The United States Government remains convinced that
                            the underlying cause of trouble in Southeast Asia is armed action
                            against the people and Government of South Vietnam by forces whose
                            actions can be decisively affected from North Vietnam. The United States
                            will be very watchful to see whether in this period of pause there are
                            significant reductions in such armed actions by such forces. The United
                            States must emphasize that the road toward the end of armed attacks
                            against the people and Government of Vietnam is the only road which will
                            permit the Government of Vietnam and the Government of the United States
                            to bring a permanent end to their air attacks on North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In taking this action the United States is well aware of the risk that a
                            temporary suspension of these air attacks may be misunderstood as an
                            indication of weakness, and it is therefore necessary for me to point
                            out that if this pause should be misunderstood in this fashion, by any
                            party, it would be necessary to demonstrate more clearly than ever,
                            after the pause ended, that the United States is determined not to
                            accept aggression without reply in Vietnam. Moreover, the United States
                            must point out that the decision to end air attacks for this limited
                            trial period is one which it must be free to reverse if at any time in
                            the coming days there should be actions by the other side in Vietnam
                            which required immediate reply.</p>
                        <p>But my Government is very hopeful that there will be no such
                            misunderstanding and that this first pause in the air attacks may meet
                            with a response which will permit further and more extended suspension
                            of this form of military action in the expectation of equally
                            constructive actions by the other side in the future. End text.</p>

                            press pressures, and made clear our action related only to strikes of
                            any sort and not to continued reconnaissance. (Paper itself makes clear

                        <p>55813. Rolling Thunder Program.</p>
                        <p>1. With the completion of our fourteenth week of Rolling Thunder it
                            appears appropriate to assess briefly what we have done and to suggest
                            our future course. Any such assessment when related to the fundamental
                            purpose of the air campaign must be inconclusive at this time. The
                            possibility remains, however, that we are in more danger of minimizing
                            the effects of Rolling Thunder than we are of exaggerating them. These
                            air attacks have disrupted road and rail movements in North Vietnam.
                            They have, in a few short weeks, completely changed the pattern of
                            logistic support into Laos and it may be here that we first see concrete
                            military results of our air attacks, because the Laotian Communists are
                            more directly dependent on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support
                            than are the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The cumulative effects
                            of our interdiction campaign will be realized as the rainy season adds
                            to the effects of our air interdiction.</p>
                        <p>2. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether or not much remains to be
                            done south of 20 degrees N. Destruction of the DRV military and logistic
                            support facilities and LOC's south of 20 degrees has just <pb xml:id="pg_641" n="641" facs="0673"/>begun. Within four of the major
                            barracks complexes attacked, roughly two thirds of the 674 known
                            buildings remain undamaged. Of three major ammo stowage depot complexes
                            attacked, 40 percent of the 46 known ammo stowage and 56 percent of the
                            93 known depot support buildings have been destroyed/damaged. Similarly,
                            within two major support depot complexes attacked, 46 percent of the 90
                            known buildings have yet to be hit. The surface has barely been
                            scratched on striking <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> shipping and
                            port facilities. And, in spite of the success of our bridge attacks, the
                            major portion of the bridge and ferry system remains intact. Newly
                            developed, dispersed staging, rest and refueling are yet to be
                            attacked.</p>
                        <p>3. In the development of a sustained air campaign, we must carefully
                            weigh the capabilities and limitations of US air power operating within
                            current political parameters and the vulnerabilities of the DRV within
                            this framework. It is certain that we cannot expect interdiction, even
                            when we attain a maximum feasible damage level, to stop completely
                            supplies flowing to the VC through southern <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Laos routes. Further, we cannot predict how
                            successful the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will be in procuring
                            weapons and ammunition through other sources and channels.</p>
                        <p>Although the immediate military objective is to reduce the movement of
                            personnel and supplies to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            and PL/VM, in our effort to accomplish this we must develop and drive
                            home to the DRV leadership the idea that our staying power is greater
                            than theirs. To do this we should raise their direct costs in terms of
                            manpower and military, logistic and support facilities and in indirect
                            economic effects. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the
                            characteristics of the air campaign should be such as to generate
                            pessimism and a feeling of helplessness among the military and general
                            frustration, anxiety, and fear among the people. Lastly, we should
                            present the government and military with an ever growing management
                            problem. The cumulative effect of these internal problems should serve
                            to turn <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attention inward rather than
                            outward. The total impact would be realized in degradation of
                            supervision, military training, cadre replacement and build up for Laos
                            and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> as well as in reduction of
                            supplies. The concept of making it as difficult and costly as possible
                            for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to support insurrection in
                            Laos and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> should embrace the totality
                            of these effects. Its success will be realized when the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is convinced that the cost of
                            aggression is too high.</p>
                        <p>4. The concept we propose calls for an ubiquitous demonstration of U.S.
                            airpower carrying out an around the clock program of immobilization,
                            attrition, and harassment. Specific types of missions would be as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Carry out extensive day armed recce of land and inland waterway routes
                            south of 20 degrees, and night blockade tactics.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_642" n="642" facs="0674"/>
                        <p>B. Continue and increase the route interdiction program south of 20
                            degrees.</p>
                        <p>C. Attack repeatedly, until no longer lucrative, the known military
                            facilities within this same area which can be effectively attacked by a
                            small strike force.</p>
                        <p>D. Seek out and destroy dispersed supplies, equipment and military
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>E. Step up interdiction of supplies by sea through attack on port
                            facilities and recognized <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            shipping.</p>
                        <p>5. These missions would be accomplished on an incremental basis by
                            scheduling appropriate numbers of aircraft for repeated strikes. We have
                            more than enough air power to keep unrelenting pressure on North
                            Vietnam. This pressure is somewhat less than it could be were it not for
                            certain operational restraints which we have imposed upon ourselves. It
                            is possible without altering the necessarily rigid control of our
                            Rolling Thunder campaign to increase significantly the effectiveness of
                            our air operations by combining greater numbers of armed reconnaissance
                            flights with small precise bombing attacks on prebriefed military
                            targets. We would then get maximum surveillance with its inhibiting
                            effect on military movements in North Vietnam along with effective
                            attacks on military objectives. Armed recce flights would be augmented
                            by other small flights of pre-briefed or on call aircraft. Analysis
                            indicates desired damage levels on certain type targets can be achieved
                            with a lesser number of total strike aircraft per target, while at the
                            same time maintaining maximum area harassment of repair efforts through
                            these frequent and unpredictable patterns of attacks. Our operations
                            should include a mixed bag of tricks including stepped-up night
                            operations with flare ships, more frequent use of delayed fuze weapons
                            to further harass repair activities and the establishment of fixed
                            surveillance points immediately inside the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/Laos border. Flare plane assistance would be provided
                            during the hours of darkness and the areas selected for surveillance
                            would be the critical funnel areas of the route system leading to Laos.
                            We would, in effect, be establishing aerial choke points. The total
                            psychological impact upon the military, work crews and general populace
                            generated by these frequent unpredictable attacks would be an important
                            aspect of the campaign.</p>
                        <p>6. In addition to these small strikes and armed recce effort south of 20
                            degrees, we think that larger scale attacks have a role in the campaign.
                            We should, however, get away from the concept of inflicting maximum
                            feasible damage in a one day strike. As a desirable alternative I
                            recommend we attack larger targets incrementally over a period of days
                            as necessary and as indicated by our <gloss target="#t_BDA1">BDA</gloss>. Our present tactic of carrying out a strike in a one day
                            period has become too stereotyped. Incremental attacks would give us
                            greater latitude in marginal weather, would provide for more effective
                            employment of strike aircraft and would probably <pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0675"/>result in greater and more precise damage to
                            the primary targets and should reduce our losses. Large scale strikes
                            should be continued against the major targets south of 20 degrees.
                            Later, large-scale strikes should be programmed against major military
                            installations ranging northwestward to Dien Bien Phu. Timing of the
                            large strikes should be left flexible. They would be mounted according
                            to the developing situation as political and psychological
                            considerations made them appear desirable. The Dien Bien Phu military
                            complex could be attacked to attain maximum damage and destruction;
                            attack on this prestige target complex would be felt throughout the
                            Asian Communist world and its role in resupplying PL/VM forces in Laos
                            cannot be underestimated.</p>
                        <p>7. Rolling Thunder should be complemented by increased and intensified
                            psychological operations. We should continue to repeat in simple
                            non-polemic language that we have no quarrel with the people and they
                            should be warned to avoid all military installations. We should hammer
                            home the main themes of our intent to destroy their military capacity
                            and our determination to continue until the military leave their cousins
                            in peace. Overt propaganda, on a world-wide basis, should echo the same
                            themes; releases on mission accomplishments should stress our objectives
                            as we highlight accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>8. Target and “Strike Zones” are as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Initially, strikes should continue to be limited to the area from the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to 20 degrees. All military
                            facilities and <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets listed in the
                            current AIF/PACOM <gloss target="#t_CPFL1">CPFL</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> should be considered for attack by
                            small flights. We hold AIF/CPFL data on more than 225 military/<gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets in the following categories:
                            RR/highway bridges, ferries, RR yards, port facilities, warehouse areas,
                                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage, naval bases, airfields,
                            military headquarters/barracks, military schools/training areas/camps
                            and military ammo/supply/depots. About 100 of these targets appear on
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> numbered target system, but most
                            of them qualify for attack under the concept expressed herein.</p>
                        <p>b. Northwestward from the 20th parallel, the following nine major
                            military supply/ammo depots and barracks warrant large strikes:</p>
                        <p>(1) Target 29—Quang Suoi Bks NE (73 Bks/storage bldgs).</p>
                        <p>(2) Target 43—Qui Hau ammo depot w (23 ammo storage bldgs).</p>
                        <p>(3) Target 61—Xom Chang supply depot (17 storage bldgs with 10 Bks/7
                            support bldgs).</p>
                        <p>(4) Target 28—Ban Xom Lom Bks (Div HQ—363 Bldgs including 191 storage and
                            30 ammo).</p>
                        <p>(5) Target 46—Ban Phung How ammo depot (10 semi-revetted ammo storage, 5
                            prob ammo storage and 8 supply bldgs).</p>
                        <p>(6) Target 25—Son La Bks (complex is large military supply/Bks
                            concentration containing 367 Bks/warehouse bldgs, of which over 100 are
                            supply storage).</p>
                        <p>(7) Target 56—Son La Army supply depot (co-located with target 25).</p>
                        <p>(8) Target 63—Thuan Chau Bks/depot (571 bldgs).</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_644" n="644" facs="0676"/>
                        <p>(9) Target 25—Dien Bien Phu Bks (142 Bldgs). Dien Bien Phu complex
                            includes airfield, radar, radio and <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>
                            316 div. As the large strikes progress towards Dien Bien Phu, we should
                            extend the armed recce and small strike zone accordingly.</p>
                        <p>9. In summary, armed recce would operate as continuously as weather
                            permits and with a high degree of flexibility. Ordnance loads would
                            provide for surveillance and attack of fleeting targets on specified
                            route sectors after attacking pre-briefed fixed targets with optimum
                            munitions. On call strikes would be ready for unusual targets of
                            opportunity. Random routing would be developed to avoid set patterns.
                            Around the clock surveillance would be maintained over <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> funnels. Weather alternates would be
                            standard.</p>
                        <p>10. I recommend that this concept be accepted and that concurrently
                            numerical limits be lifted on armed reconnaissance and that these small
                            controlled air operations be limited only by our capability to execute
                            them.</p>

                        <p>1. You are considering a decision to suspend air attacks on North Vietnam
                            for several days. You would not announce this decision in any way, but
                            you would call attention to this pause privately with Moscow and Hanoi.
                            While this pause would not be a long one, it would indicate our own
                            ability to move either way, depending upon the actions of the enemy.
                            This pause would not be extended or repeated merely in return for a
                            conference, but only if there were major reductions in the level of

                            from 12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m., I informed him about the “pause” after his

                            follow:</p>
                        <p>Hanoi is now more responsive to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            than to China, and the new Foreign Minister is more pro-Moscow than

                            <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> was ready to talk
                            with the United States and South Vietnam alone, but a new element has
                            now been introduced. While originally only Peking insisted that in any
                            peace talks South Vietnam should be represented exclusively by the Viet
                            Cong, Hanoi has now taken this position too.</p>
                        <p>In early March <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> asked
                            Algeria to inform the Viet Cong and Hanoi representatives in Algiers
                            that it was unrealistic to insist on the Viet Cong as the exclusive
                            representative of South Vietnam in any talks with the United States. So
                            far he has had no reply. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>
                            thinks that if the United States excludes any Viet Cong representation
                            in any peace or cease-fire discussions, there will be no discussions.
                            But he also believes a compromise possible, i.e. assuming there were six
                            seated at the table, North Vietnam would be represented by two, the
                            United States by two, and South Vietnam by two—one from the Viet Cong
                            and one from Saigon. He cites the recommendation of the three factions
                            in the Laos negotiations as pertinent.</p>
                        <p>If any such discussion relates only to hostilities over the frontiers,
                            then in his view the representation should be just the United States and
                            Hanoi, thus avoiding the Viet Cong problem. However, he doubts that
                            Hanoi would talk on this basis.</p>
                        <p>While he doubts that there will be any response, as a result of the
                            “pause” from Hanoi satisfactory to us, if the question of the Viet Cong
                            representation could be worked out privately in advance he thinks there
                            is a good chance of discussions starting. When it appears that the
                            United States is being more than reasonable, he suspects Hanoi with
                            Soviet encouragement will overrule Peking.</p>
                        <p>He would clearly consider with us making a public (or private) appeal for
                            a cease-fire or for discussions of conditions for the cessation of
                            hostilities, either during or after the “pause”. He thinks it certain
                            that Peking would oppose but assumes that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and France would go along. He would welcome our views
                            both as to language and timing of any such appeal. And when I suggested
                            that it might include something as follows, he did not dissent:</p>
                        <p>“The United States has offered to discuss peaceful settlement in Vietnam,
                            without preconditions. The United States has suspended its bombing
                            temporarily. It is time the belligerents opened discussions of
                            conditions for the total cessation of hostilities preliminary to
                            discussions of peaceful settlement.”</p>
                        <p>He seemed eager to cooperate in any way, and if we have any suggestions
                            as to Viet Cong representation, he would clearly explore the <pb xml:id="pg_647" n="647" facs="0679"/>possibilities (through the
                            Soviet Union) privately, without in any way committing us in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of previous experience with explorations in Hanoi, he thinks
                            it might take ten days to two weeks to get a reply.</p>
                        <p>In view of the “pause” he did not press me for an answer on his proposal
                            for a cease-fire appeal at this time.</p>

                        <p>I also discussed with him the Indian three-point proposal<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">See <ref target="#d285">Document 285</ref>.</note>

                            position was well known—that the United States troops should get out of

                            <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>'s report was that in his

                            and he saw no hope of ever doing anything with him in New York.</p>

                            conversation with Secretary US Govt has made decision which we hoped
                            would be both understood and not misunderstood. I had been informed by
                            several high Soviet sources that decision we had taken was precisely
                            what was called for but none had been in position to predict reaction.
                            Our purpose in reaching this significant decision was to attempt to
                            ascertain if a way could be found to peaceful solution of current crisis
                            in Southeast Asia. We had hoped we would be able to deliver oral
                            communication conveying this decision to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> authorities and I had attempted to do so today through
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador. Unfortunately Amb
                            let it be known that he did not wish to receive me personally and when
                            his Emb was informed that the message I sought to deliver was of extreme
                            importance it was suggested that we transmit the message through the
                            Soviet Govt in its capacity as Geneva co-chairman. It was because of
                            these circumstances that I had found it necessary to disturb Mr.

                            receive me Emb had succeeded in delivering a copy of oral communication
                            to employee of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Emb earlier this
                            evening (2015 local) who agreed to bring it to attention of Amb.

                            against aggression and control by Saigon puppets. Furthermore it
                            indicated to <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> that we
                            continued to view the picture incorrectly when we referred again to the
                            struggle in South Vietnam as being organized and directed by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. The absurdity of this view, he said,
                            is obvious and naturally the Soviet Govt cannot agree with it as it has
                            made clear in numerous statements. <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> could only view the communication as repetition
                            of the threat against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>—now a
                            threat of renewed and expanded aggression. This was the only way he
                            could interpret the reference to the risk that a suspension of attacks
                            involved. Obviously we are suffering from a gross misunderstanding if we
                            think that such aggression will go unpunished, without response. The
                            only constructive approach to a peaceful settlement of the situation in
                            South Vietnam was to end the aggression, recall troops from South
                            Vietnam and give the Vietnamese people the right to choose their own
                            form of govt—a choice which can be made freely only if the so-called
                            specialists should be withdrawn and their opportunity of exercising <pb xml:id="pg_649" n="649" facs="0681"/>influence on the Vietnamese
                            thus removed. <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> said that
                            he well acquainted with the countries and peoples of Southeast Asia; he
                            therefore was aware and could understand the feelings caused by our
                            actions there as well as the reaction in many other parts of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> I had asked to see
                            him to put a very simple question to him. Does the Soviet Govt agree to
                            transmit the oral communication to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>? I said this was the whole purpose of my visit.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Emb had not put such a request to the
                            Sov Govt. I must agree that for Sovs to act as intermediary between US
                            and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is very unusual. Naturally he
                            would report my request to his govt and if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should request this service he would not exclude the
                            possibility of transmitting the communication to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Govt. Meanwhile he would be interested
                            in knowing just how the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Emb had
                            responded to our approach.</p>
                        <p>I again described for <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> our
                            efforts to deliver the message to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> through its Emb in Moscow and told him that the end
                            result was a suggestion by the Emb that we transmit the message through
                            the Sov Govt in its capacity as Geneva co-chairman. <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> repeated his promise to report
                            my request to his govt and to inform me of the results.</p>
                        <p>(At this point <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> passed a
                            note to Kornienko who attended him and latter left the room, not to
                            return until just before the conversation was concluded.)</p>
                        <p>I thanked <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> and then said I
                            wished comment briefly on his remarks. I was well acquainted with the
                            Sov view of the situation in Vietnam and since I had on several
                            occasions expressed my govt's view to numerous Sov officials I was sure
                            he was aware of the way we looked at the situation. We did not consider
                            resistance to aggression as aggression. We could discuss our differences
                            of view for hours but my purpose in calling on him tonight was not to
                            enter into such a discussion but simply to ask the Soviet Govt to pass
                            an important message to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We had
                            noted the reported Soviet indications that if air strikes should be
                            discontinued the situation might improve with respect to finding a way
                            to peaceful settlement. Secondly we had read with great care the Sov
                            Govt appeal several days ago in which the govt came out for peaceful
                            solution of all questions in dispute. Finally we had noted and the
                            President had responded positively to the appeal by the 17 unaligned
                                nations,<note n="5" xml:id="d298fn5">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> although so far as I was aware the
                            other governments chiefly concerned—the Sovs, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and China—had not yet officially replied. I stressed
                            that my govt considers the communication which we were asking the Sovs
                            to pass to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> a genuine concession
                            on our part toward finding the path to peaceful settlement about which
                            the Sov Govt itself <pb xml:id="pg_650" n="650" facs="0682"/>had
                            expressed its view in its appeal several days ago. I hoped that this
                            initiative would be correctly understood and taken in this light by the
                            Soviet Govt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> said he wished reaffirm
                            his govt's support for peaceful solutions of all questions in dispute.
                            However peaceful solutions are out of question when negotiations must
                            take place under the gun. They cannot take place under pressure or when
                            one side operates from a position of strength. He wished inform me again
                            there had been no request from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            Emb that Sov Govt act as intermediary and he felt therefore that it
                            would be more convenient for US to find another way “bypassing us.”</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> that I saw no
                            purpose in continuing discuss substantive questions which should
                            probably be the subject of conference if there should be one. I would
                            merely point out that with regard to his remarks on “position of
                            strength” that shooting and bombing are being carried on by two sides,
                            not just one. I then said he should know that I had told him of our
                            efforts to approach the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Emb simply
                            as a matter of information. I did not believe the attitude of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> had any bearing on the request I had
                            put to <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName>. I was asking
                                <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> in the name of the
                            Govt of United States to pass important communication to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. (During translation these remarks,
                            Kornienko reappeared and handed note to <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> which latter read carefully.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> then said flatly Sov Govt
                            would not do this. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Emb has not
                            requested this service. He said there were number of ways of passing the
                            message to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and it was our
                            responsibility to find the most convenient way.</p>
                        <p>I said I wished to understand him correctly. Was he rejecting my request
                            to transmit the communication to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>He said this was a correct understanding of the Sov Govt position. We
                            must ourselves find the way.</p>
                        <p>I said that what I was seeking was the cooperation of the Sov Govt and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName>'s remarks indicated
                            clearly that the Sov Govt was refusing this. <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> said “I am not a postman” and again said we
                            could find our own ways of transmitting messages.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> that the
                            cooperation I had requested is a well-known and not unprecented process
                            in international diplomacy. I had great difficulty in reconciling Sov
                            Govt refusal to cooperate with its declaration in support of peaceful
                            settlement of disputed questions.</p>
                        <p>Kornienko chimed in that he had recalled statement by both the President
                            and Secretary of State on several occasions that the US Govt has
                            channels for transmitting messages direct to Hanoi. On this the
                            conversation ended but it should be noted that <persName corresp="#p_FN2">Firyubin</persName> made no effort to <pb xml:id="pg_651" n="651" facs="0683"/>return to me the text of the
                            oral communication which I had handed him at the outset of the
                            conversation.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Principal Features of the Plan</p>
                        <p>This memorandum proposes a plan for achieving our objectives in South
                            Viet-Nam by shifting the struggle from the military to the political
                            arena. The plan has two principal features:</p>
                        <p>a. The promulgation by the South Vietnamese Government of a Program for
                            Social and Political Reconstruction. This Program is designed to invite
                            the peaceful participation of Viet Cong adherents in the national life
                            of South Viet-Nam. It should make it possible for political activity to
                            be substituted for a shooting war in one after another of the provinces
                            of South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>b. A temporary halt of offensive military operations for a stated period
                            to permit full dissemination and consideration of the Government's
                            program <pb xml:id="pg_653" n="653" facs="0685"/>throughout the country.
                            These offensive operations would be resumed if the program meets
                            substantial Viet Cong resistance.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Case for Transforming the Struggle</p>
                        <p>We have, from the beginning, made clear that our objective in Southeast
                            Asia is to bring about a political solution that would assure the
                            independence of South Viet-Nam. We have so far assumed that we could
                            achieve an acceptable political settlement only when our military
                            pressure had reached the point where the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
                            were ready to give up the struggle.</p>
                        <p>Yet now—or in the near future—we may well be facing a situation where
                            each side will be led to accept more dangerous and onerous expedients in
                            an effort to achieve its major objectives.</p>
                        <p>Presumably the North Vietnamese are worried about the costs imposed by
                            our continued air strikes and the danger that those air strikes will be
                            extended to urban and industrial areas. Hanoi may also fear the
                            long-range consequences if it is forced to accept increased dependence
                            on Peiping. But the experience of the French from 1945 to 1954 vividly
                            testifies to Viet Cong willingness to submit to heavy punishment rather
                            than give up their long-sought objective of a Communist State covering
                            the whole of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The United States, on its part, cannot accept a Viet Cong victory. But
                            continuance of the war on the assumption that—by military pressure—we
                            can force Hanoi to say “uncle” may lead to a gradual escalation of the
                            conflict and a progressively larger involvement of both the Chinese
                            Communists and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances each side may find advantage in moving the
                            conflict from the military to the political arena.</p>
                        <p>Given the present balance of relative military effectiveness, such a move
                            is possible only under arrangements that would enable each side to
                            conclude that it has substantially as good a chance of achieving its
                            long-range goals in the political arena as by continuing military
                            action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Attractions of the Plan for the United States
                            and South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The United States and South Viet-Nam would have a sound basis for
                            concluding that the arrangements contemplated by the plan proposed in
                            this memorandum would provide them with a reasonable chance of success
                            through political action—at least as good as the chance of success
                            through military action alone. The United States has the resources to
                            move South Viet-Nam toward rapid economic development. We know that we
                            will stay the course and not lose interest. The history of other former
                            colonial nations in the post-war period has shown that, given the <pb xml:id="pg_654" n="654" facs="0686"/>resources and opportunity to
                            evolve their own political institutions, they will be likely to steer a
                            non-Communist course.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Attractions for North Viet-Nam</p>
                        <p>Analyzing the plan in terms of their own doctrinal convictions, the North
                            Vietnamese could also conclude that it offered them an adequate chance
                            to achieve their long-range objectives. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho
                                Chi Minh</persName> demonstrated in 1954 that he was not in a hurry.
                            The Vietnamese Communists have repeatedly shown their willingness to
                            work within long time spans. While they would be prepared to absorb
                            enormous punishment before abandoning the purpose they have sought for
                            four decades, they might well be prepared to wait a few years longer to
                            achieve that purpose—sustained by the conviction that the United States
                            would lose interest in South Viet-Nam, that they could subvert any
                            government that could be established in that country, and that over the
                            long pull Communist success was inevitable.</p>
                        <p>It might take ten years or more to determine which judgment was right,
                            but ten years is a long time in the present-day world. Within the next
                            decades new elements could enter the equation that would fundamentally
                            change the whole situation.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Purposes of Plan</p>
                        <p>Briefly stated, the purposes of the plan are—</p>
                        <p>A. To enable us to probe for a less dangerous means than military force
                            alone—at present or higher levels—for preserving an independent,
                            non-Communist South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>b. To supplement the continuing military effort by offering the prospect
                            of political and economic progress for the South Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>c. To provide a program having substantial positive propaganda value both
                            in South Viet-Nam and throughout the world.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Advantages of Plan</p>
                        <p>The major advantages of the Plan are these—</p>
                        <p>a. It offers the chance to halt offensive military operations by both
                            sides. Yet it at all times reserves to us the option of resuming full
                            military operations if the plan is not achieving its purpose.</p>
                        <p>b. It does not require the Government of South Viet-Nam to enter into
                            “negotiations” with the North Vietnamese Government or the National
                            Liberation Front, but it would not preclude formal negotiations at other
                            levels. We could and should maintain our posture of willingness to hold
                            discussions with any “government concerned” and to participate <pb xml:id="pg_655" n="655" facs="0687"/>in a formal negotiating
                            conference if one should be called under suitable conditions.</p>
                        <p>c. It avoids any implication that the United States lacks confidence in
                            the South Vietnamese Government or in the ultimate success of our
                            cooperative military effort.</p>
                        <p>d. It would be offered by the South Vietnamese Government as that
                            Government's own political act—an act made possible by the political and
                            military achievements of recent months. It would not be presented as a
                            bargaining proposal to be withdrawn if rejected by the Communists, but
                            as the Government's considered plan for improving the lot of its people,
                            to be pursued whether or not the Communists approve it.</p>
                        <p>e. It should help to unite differing factions in urban areas while giving
                            the Vietnamese peasantry positive inducements for identifying themselves
                            with Saigon's political fortunes.</p>
                        <p>f. As a display of political initiative, it should enhance the strength
                            and effectiveness of the South Vietnamese Government, whatever the
                            reactions on the other side.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Substance and Execution of Plan</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Consultation and Coordination with the
                            Vietnamese Government</p>
                        <p>1. Once the plan is approved by the President, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would be recalled to
                            Washington. After he had reviewed the plan, he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> would proceed to Saigon to explain
                            it to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                            other key officials in the United States Mission.</p>
                        <p>2. The outlines of the plan would be discussed with the Prime Minister of
                            South Viet-Nam, one or two key generals (e.g., <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName>) and perhaps a small number of Vietnamese officials.
                            The Vietnamese Government would be encouraged to put forward the plan as
                            its own with the fewest possible changes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Private Communication to Hanoi and Moscow</p>
                        <p>Just before the public announcement of the plan, Hanoi and Moscow would
                            be informed through secret channels of its essential provisions. This
                            would provide direct, clear and credible evidence of our serious desire
                            to move from a military to a political solution. Peiping would be left
                            out of this consultation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although the North Vietnamese and the
                            Soviets would inform the Chinese in due course, it seems preferable for
                            the first reactions to be those of the North Vietnamese and the Soviets.
                            This would leave Peiping last man in and, hopefully, odd man out. The
                            risk of rubbing salt in Chinese wounds may be worth it.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_656" n="656" facs="0688"/>
                        <p>The private word to the Soviets would come directly from us. The message
                            to North Viet-Nam would go through a trusted intermediary speaking for
                            us and for South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The timing of the private communication should precede the public
                            announcement by just enough to give the other side a little time to
                            decide its first reaction but not enough time to anticipate us by a
                            political or military move of its own, such as recognizing a puppet
                            Front Government or launching a large attack. Twenty-four hours would
                            seem about right.</p>

                            reconciliation under a government free of foreign control, representing
                            the Vietnamese people and capable of meeting their needs.</p>

                        <p>6. Announce—in general terms—that once civil insurrection had ended, the
                            Government would expect to establish trade and other forms of peaceful
                            intercourse with the North and to examine other matters of common
                            interest.</p>

                            official. As soon as the announcement is made, the United States could
                            express its full support, including concurrence in the military pause,
                            and its willingness to withdraw forces on a phased basis (assuming
                            proper response on the other side) and to furnish assistance for the

                            <hi rend="italic">A. First Element: An offer of amnesty to all Viet Cong
                                adherents who cease fighting</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This offer (which could be portrayed as an expansion of the current Chieu
                            Hoi Program) would be addressed to the Viet Cong members in the South
                            rather than to its Northern commanders. This would permit the Government
                            in Saigon to maintain the posture that it was not “negotiating” with the
                            North or with the National Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>The offer might appeal, most of all, to the Viet Cong local and district
                            forces and sympathizers and to those provincial or main-force elements
                            whose military position may be precarious.</p>
                        <p>Amnesty would imply the delivery of arms. But very few of the Viet Cong
                            would be likely to come in and lay down their arms since that would
                            involve their public admission of Viet Cong activities.</p>
                        <p>Since many of the Viet Cong adherents cannot be identified, amnesty in
                            practice might consist merely of a halt in individual military
                            participation and a return to civilian life by peasants who would never
                            concede their past Viet Cong association.</p>

                            areas. The Program would provide for similar elections at later dates
                            throughout the country. The Premier would promise—as soon as local
                            elections had been held in areas containing a substantial majority of
                            the population—to call together a constitutional assembly to draft and
                            adopt a new constitution for South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Former Viet Cong adherents who had qualified for amnesty would be
                            eligible to participate as voters and candidates. They would participate
                            in the political life of the country as would the representatives of any
                            political party that did not advocate the overthrow of the Government by

                            “Provisional Charter” has since been drafted by the High National

                            full effect. It is essential to this Plan that a constitution be
                            approved by some representative body in which peaceful elements of the
                            Viet Cong may participate.</p>

                                Government would seek to establish its presence with a minimum of
                                disruption to local administrative arrangements currently acceptable
                                to the local populace</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Viet Cong base areas, this would involve leaving local administration
                            more or less in present hands, but on the explicit condition that these
                            administrators did not resist the right of Central Government officials
                            to move freely and carry out limited functions within their areas.</p>
                        <p>In marginal or contested areas a delicate balance would have to be struck
                            on a case-by-case basis. In areas where Viet Cong local administrations
                            were operating by stealth and terror, the process of redress would
                            proceed gradually as the power of the Government presence increased and
                            inspired public confidence.</p>
                        <p>Where the actual authority is now exercised by Viet Cong adherents and
                            there is no government authority, incumbents would not be disturbed
                            until after village council elections. Future local administrative
                            arrangements would depend on the results of the elections.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Government would immediately launch economic and social
                            reconstruction programs with special emphasis on education, medical
                            care, the provision of seeds and fertilizers, land tenure reform and
                            debt cancellations or moratoria. The last feature would be particularly
                            attractive to the Vietnamese peasantry.</p>
                        <p>The immediate launching of such a program is an urgent political
                            necessity to match the land reform and other social programs of the
                            National Liberation Front.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, substantial United States financial and technical assistance
                            would be required to assure a prompt start and visible progress.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister would announce he had arranged for the withdrawal of

                            has effectively extended its authority throughout the country. The
                            withdrawal might begin when resistance ceases in all but the hard-core
                            Viet Cong strongholds. The withdrawal could be completed when the
                            Vietnamese forces are able to move so freely as to be able to certify
                            that no large caches, camps, etc. remain.</p>

                        <p>The pause in military operations to be announced by the Prime Minister
                            would (1) be limited in time; and (2) apply only to offensive military
                            operations such as target bombing in North Viet-Nam and search-and <pb xml:id="pg_659" n="659" facs="0691"/>kill operations in the South.
                            It would not include suspension of the sea blockade, the bombing of
                            supply routes in Laos, or full response to any Viet Cong incidents in
                            South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Purpose of the Pause</p>
                        <p>The pause would serve the purpose of assuring that the other side gave
                            serious attention to the Plan. It would also help both North Viet-Nam
                            and the Viet Cong to save face by providing an action to which they
                            could more easily respond. And the pause would have propaganda value
                            throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>The pause would be more effective if United States reinforcements were
                            not introduced during the period but no promise should be made to this
                            effect.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Duration of the Pause</p>
                        <p>In the Prime Minister's announcement he would make clear—</p>
                        <p>1) that the pause would last for a limited period—say two weeks—to permit
                            full consideration of the Program for Social and Political
                            Reconstruction;</p>
                        <p>2) that at the end of the two-week period the Program would be put into
                            effect;</p>
                        <p>3) that offensive military measures would immediately be resumed wherever
                            the Program was resisted by Viet Cong forces; and</p>
                        <p>4) that, if resistance was wide-spread, military pressure on the North
                            would also be resumed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Public Announcement of the Pause</p>
                        <p>On balance we believe there are advantages in announcing the pause
                            publicly rather that in communicating it privately:</p>
                        <p>1) Its announcement in connection with the Program for Social and
                            Political Reconstruction would help draw the attention of Viet Cong
                            adherents to a future political path that would include a role for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>2) It would avoid any inference of weakness that might be drawn from a
                            secret proposal for a military pause by the South Viet-Nam Government to
                            the North.</p>
                        <p>3) It would relieve the North of the embarrassment implicit in responding
                            to such a secret proposal, and thus demonstrating to the world that it
                            controls the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Communist Response</p>
                        <p>Obviously, there would be difficulties in determining the Viet Cong
                            response. Statistical analysis may not give reliable quantitative or
                            qualitative measurements to show significant increases or decreases in
                            the <pb xml:id="pg_660" n="660" facs="0692"/>scale of Viet Cong
                            operations. We must also decide whether our willingness to continue the
                            pause should (1) be made dependent on no increase above the present
                            level of Viet Cong activity, or (2) upon some further decrease below the
                            present level.</p>
                        <p>Any public statement concerning the pause would probably have to list—as
                            one of the expected responses—a halt of infiltration from the North. But
                            we must recognize that such infiltration is not readily measurable in
                            the short term. It is also—in a sense—irrelevant, since, if the Plan is
                            succeeding, that itself implies North Vietnamese acquiescence—and thus
                            presumably an end to infiltration. If we should detect substantial
                            infiltration while the pause continues and other elements of the Plan
                            are proceeding, we can consider responding by military reinforcements of
                            our own.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The recent improvements in South Vietnamese military and political
                            performance furnish our first opportunity to probe deeply for the return
                            of the contest of wills in Viet-Nam primarily to the political forum. If
                            this opportunity is seized, great hazards may be avoided and lives saved
                            in achieving our ends. Even if it fails—and the contest continues as
                            primarily a military one—the Government of South Viet-Nam will have
                            strengthened its political base, and confidence in the leadership of the
                            United States in this cause will be greatly enhanced.</p>

                        <p>1. US would announce publicly temporary suspension of bombing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>;</p>

                        <p>3. Soviet Union would intercede with Viet Cong to curtail military

                            Sagetellyan, repeating these his personal ideas, said he would talk with
                            government circles and be in touch with <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> later. He has in fact invited <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> to dinner again tonight and
                            latter will report results to me tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>During conversation Sagetellyan several times repeated Sovs could not
                            control situation in Viet-Nam but implied that if they seemed
                            responsible for bringing about cessation of bombardments influence with
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Viet Cong would be enhanced.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> felt Sagetellyan
                            reflecting official Soviet feeling both Soviet Union and US enmeshed in
                            Vietnamese situation to benefit ChiComs.</p>

                                was identified as a Foreign Office representative. In the course of
                                a 4-hour conversation, the Soviet official confirmed the general
                                nature of the proposal put to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> initially by Sagetellyan. Sergeyevitch told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> that the Soviet
                                Union was prepared to convey such a proposal from the United States
                                to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but would do so informally
                                through Sagetellyan, so as to be in a position to disavow the
                                contact if news of it leaked. (Department of State, EA/ACA Files:

                            <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> had further four hour
                            lunch conversation today with Sagetellyan and “Vassily” who identified
                            himself as “Sergeev”, latter dominated entire conversation, and told
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> he was speaking this
                            time officially and not as “an individual”.</p>
                        <p>“Sergeev” said that after further discussion of idea put to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> in previous conversations and
                            after additional clearances it had been decided that proposal as
                            originally formulated was not feasible. He made it clear that the Sovs
                            could not afford to be middleman in scheme and if US Govt should be
                            interested in pursuing contact in private channels, middleman would have
                            to be some Eastern European Socialist country and not Sovs. “Sergeev”
                            was unwilling specify which Eastern European country would be suitable
                            channel but when <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>
                            indicated that he had good contacts with Yugoslavs, he said Yugoslavia
                            was not most suitable contact.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, “Sergeev” made clear that if idea should be pursued it must be
                            amended to exclude possibility of American military presence in South
                            Vietnam after neutralist-type govt agreed on and established as
                            indicated para number three Embtel 3416. If this agreeable and if
                            satisfactory Eastern European contact established then and only then
                            would Sovs be able play role.</p>
                        <p>Confronted with this change in signals, <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> attempted to probe Sov interlocutors for
                            reasons. In doing so he expressed view that obviously Sovs after
                            checking with appropriate allies had discovered that if they went
                            through with scheme as originally outlined they ran real risk of being
                            accused both by ChiComs and DRV of engaging in real sellout. “Sergeev”
                            admitted this was fairly close to the facts.</p>
                        <p>In course conversation “Sergeev” said it would be very helpful in playing
                            out scenario if President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            could take some “positive” <pb xml:id="pg_663" n="663" facs="0695"/>action which would clearly indicate a real spirit of compromise. For
                            example, the President might take certain undefined steps with regard to
                            crisis in Dominican Republic or he might proclaim his willingness to
                            take more conciliatory attitude toward Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> made clear this sort of proposal would be
                            non-starter.</p>
                        <p>Sovs also disclosed during conversation that it has become clear that
                            ChiComs do not want conference on Cambodia and, according to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>, clearly implied that since
                            this was case Sovs would be unable to go along with Cambodia conference
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>“Sergeev” asked <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> to remain
                            in Moscow for at least one more day to lunch again with Sagetellyan and
                            him and suggested that it might be useful if he could bring along as
                            guest Gordon McClendon, (Texas businessman, head McClendon
                            Corporation—radio and TV broadcasting), who now visiting Moscow. Asked
                            why he should bring along McClendon, “Sergeev” indicated that since
                            McClendon very close to <persName>Johnson</persName> perhaps he too,
                            like <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>, in Moscow on
                            special mission. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName>
                            vigorously refuted this idea pointing out that, like him, McClendon was
                            here in Moscow on purely personal business. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> said, in any case, he could not remain in
                            Moscow for another day. He planned depart in accordance with his
                            original schedule. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> said
                            that he would give a full report of his conversations with Sagetellyan
                            and “Sergeev” to Washington on Monday. “Sergeev” said that he should
                            continue to consider Zinchuk as Washington contact but only to inform
                            Sovs of Eastern European country worked out as “drop”.<note n="4" xml:id="d302fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> concluded, in telegram
                                3426 from Moscow, May 15, that the Soviet approach to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> was authorized by senior
                                officials in the Foreign Office and elsewhere in the Soviet
                                Government, but was vetoed by higher levels in the government,
                                probably after discussing it with the North Vietnamese Ambassador.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> suggested that
                                    <persName>Rusk</persName> mention the Soviet approach to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> in his
                                conversations with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Vienna, to further test Soviet
                                intentions. (Ibid.) <persName>Rusk</persName> responded, in Secto 27
                                from Vienna, May 15, that he viewed the Soviet approach as genuine,
                                but he was not inclined to raise it with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> unless <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> brought it up. <persName>Rusk</persName> did
                                not believe that the substance of the Soviet proposal offered a
                                promising basis for negotiations. (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> at 10:40 a.m. on May 15
                                about the collapse of the <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> channel, stating: “Our guess is that they

                        <p>Secto 29. Mayflower. For the Under Secretary from the Secretary. Have
                            just returned from Chancellor's lunch for visiting dignitaries. After
                            lunch <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I and our wives
                            were at a small table for coffee. I commented to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we were in something of a
                            dilemma about Southeast Asia. We felt there might be some value in a
                            serious exchange of views between our two governments but that we did
                            not know whether they themselves wished to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>He commented with considerable seriousness that the Soviets will not
                            negotiate about Viet-Nam. He said there were other parties involved in
                            that situation and that the United States would have to find ways of
                            establishing contact with them, and he specifically mentioned the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. He said they will continue to support
                            North Viet-Nam and will do so “decisively”. He then made reference to a
                            fellow socialist country under attack.</p>
                        <p>I interrupted to point out that the problem was not that a socialist
                            country was subject to attack but that a socialist country was attacking
                            someone else. I said that American military forces are in South Viet-Nam
                            solely because North Viet-Nam has been sending large numbers of men and
                            arms into the South.</p>
                        <p>He denied these facts in the usual ritual fashion but added that in any
                            event it was not up to the United States to be the judge between
                            Vietnamese. I reminded him that he must know by now that a North Korean
                            attack against South Koreans would not be accepted merely because both
                            were Korean. He merely commented that there were important differences
                            between those two situations.</p>
                        <p>He referred to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s talk
                            with me<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">See <ref target="#d294">Document
                                    294</ref>.</note> and said that the temporary suspension of
                            bombing was “insulting”. I said I could not understand this in view of
                            the fact that Hanoi, Peiping and Moscow have all talked about the
                            impossibility of discussions while bombing was going on.</p>
                        <p>At this point Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_KJ1">Klaus</persName>
                            joined the table to express great happiness that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I were sitting together.
                            Neither one of us dispelled his illusion.</p>

                        <p>I do not know whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will
                            pursue the matter further when the four Foreign Ministers meet briefly

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and I both have the
                            impression that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                            attitude clearly means that the <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> talk was of little substance and that we should
                            now merely consider what kind of signal we wish to get back by way of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Salinger</persName> as a part of the
                            closing out process.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that we should assume from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks that we ourselves should not put to
                            Moscow our own most serious views of the situation, whether they are
                            willing to discuss them or not. It is quite clear, however, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wanted me to believe
                            that they are not prepared to work toward a settlement in Hanoi and
                            Peiping and that, indeed, unless we abandon our effort in South Viet-Nam
                            there will be very serious consequences ahead.</p>

                            <persName>Rusk</persName>: In my talks with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, they said the Russians were not going to trade
                            with or negotiate. We must deal with Hanoi and Peking. Therefore, there
                            is nothing on Russian side to cause us to hold off bombing.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we should bomb again, then pause, and then bomb again.</p>
                        <p>The President: I thought we were going to pause only 5 days</p>

                        <p>The President: I would do it Monday. Start again then and that would make

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We could start again

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Essentially the plan is
                            worked out on a local basis—going from military to political action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Rusk</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is interested in the Cambodian Conference.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NS1">Sihanouk</persName> is pulling back on
                            his original insistence that Viet Cong be represented at the conference.
                            French and British have talked to Russians and urged them to move
                            forward on Cambodian meeting.</p>
                        <p>I think we ought to get telegram to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to get his reaction to the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> plan. It will take at least three weeks to get plan
                            launched.</p>
                        <p>Tonight we don't need any decisions—except when we start bombing and what
                            we say about the resumption.</p>
                        <p>The President: If there was going to be any interest on part of Hanoi, we
                            ought to have the reaction by now. You gave them notice on Tuesday.
                            Monday will be six days. If you want to start the bombing on Tuesday,
                            that's okay.</p>
                        <p>We can tell the Congressional leadership—that we had some adjustments out
                            there. To me it's a pure question of what happens in this country. If we
                            hold off this bombing longer, people are going to say “What in the world
                            is happening.” We can inform Mansfield, the <hi rend="italic"> NY
                                Times</hi>, but we will never satisfy the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Now, if this is what you all want, we'll go on Tuesday evening our time,
                            but I would go Monday.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: What do we say to the
                            press?</p>
                        <p>The President: We don't need to disclose every piece of strategy to the
                            press. I would say to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>,
                            Kennedy, <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> that we
                            notified the other people—and for six days we have held off bombing.
                            Nothing happened. We had no illusions that anything would happen. But we
                            were willing to be surprised.</p>
                        <p>We are anxious to pursue every diplomatic adventure to get peace. But we
                            can't throw our gun away. We have laid off them for six days—meanwhile
                            we have lost planes at Bien Hoa. No one has even thanked us for the
                            pause.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We ought to give this
                            out on background. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> ought
                            to know Hanoi spit on our face.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_667" n="667" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>The President: I'm afraid if we play along with this group, we will wind
                            up with no one on our side. We tried out their notion and got no
                            results.</p>
                        <p>My judgement is the public has never wanted us to stop the bombing. We
                            have stopped in deference to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>, but we don't want to do it too long else we
                            lose our base of support.</p>
                        <p>The President: We will go Tuesday to satisfy you here tonight. I'd go
                            Monday night myself. However, if you have good reasons, we'll go when
                            you say.</p>
                        <p>We ought to talk to the leadership and tell them what we did. We can tell
                            them we used the time for reconnaissance—and in deference to Buddha's
                            birthday. We gave them all week. We told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and we told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I'd call them in and tell them we are starting Monday night. And then
                            you'll be requested to delay again—by the <hi rend="italic"> NY
                                Times</hi>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Let's talk to the
                            leaders on Monday and tell them we are starting again to bomb on Monday
                            night.</p>
                        <p>The President: <persName>Rusk</persName>, do you buy that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Target #29<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">See <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note>
                            is military barracks 10 miles further north than we have ever gone. I
                            urge to leave this target in. Our own military will say we have gone
                            soft if we take it out again. Also it can be our message to Hanoi and
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>The President: What do you think about the threats from Russia about
                            coming in?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Rusk</persName>: There is a flash point in the Hanoi area in
                            how far you can go without bringing the Russians in. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was going to help North
                            Viet Nam and help them decisively.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>

                            <persName>Rusk</persName>: I hope we can keep the barracks target off
                            the first day's bombing—perhaps put it on the third or fourth day.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>: Actually the plan is a
                            series of pauses—in which we interpret the results each time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>: First, we put into effect
                            a plan to strengthen the Viet Nam government. They announce the plan. We
                            give the other side two weeks to think it over. For two weeks we will
                            take no offensive action. We defend ourselves, but no offensive action.
                            Government will send troops and officials into all provinces. Perhaps
                            nothing will happen in one province and something will happen in
                            another. But we will find out the temper of the other side. For if this
                            works, the rebellion is over. We will have a practical plan to test the
                            response.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CM1">CM</gloss>-616–65</p>
                        <p>1. Between 7 February and 30 April 1965, US/<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces attacked sixty specific <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-designated targets in North Vietnam. Of these, 43
                            targets were struck by US aircraft and 17 by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> aircraft. In addition, 86 armed reconnaissance
                            missions were flown against lines of communication, targets of
                            opportunity, and coastal ships.</p>
                        <p>2. The only two occasions when enemy aircraft interfered with our strikes
                            were on 3 April when a <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> damaged a US
                            aircraft, and on 4 April when two North Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s shot down two US planes. In addition,
                            one US aircraft on air patrol over the Gulf of Tonkin on 9 April was
                            lost during an intercept with Hainan Island-based <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s. Otherwise, enemy reaction has been
                            limited to antiaircraft fire from weapons up to 57mm in size. The South
                            Vietnamese have lost six planes and four pilots killed, missing and
                            captured. US losses have been 30 planes and 17 personnel killed, missing
                            and captured.</p>
                        <p>3. Our air strikes have not reduced in any major way the capability of
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> armed forces to perform their
                            mission of defense of the homeland, to train their own and infiltration
                            forces for South Vietnam and Laos, and to provide logistic support at
                            present levels of activity. The interdiction of lines of communication,
                            however, has magnified <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> problems in
                            providing logistic support to the southern portion of North Vietnam.
                            Moreover, although supplies sufficient for their current military needs
                            can still reach the area near the 17th Parallel, reduction of route
                            capacities has degraded <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ability to
                            support any major offensive beyond its own borders into Laos or South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Although over-all economic effects are considered to be minor, the
                            accumulating damage being inflicted on rolling stock and fixed
                            facilities is forcing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to expend
                            greater effort to maintain distribution of essential supplies in the
                            southern region of North Vietnam. The destruction of the Thanh Hoa
                            electric power plant has reduced electric power available to the Thanh
                            Hoa area by 60 per cent. The operation of phosphate and superphosphate
                            plants and rice processing plants are the industries which will be most
                            affected by the power shortage. Additionally, <pb xml:id="pg_671" n="671" facs="0703"/>defense preparations both north and south of
                            the 20th Parallel are believed to have diverted considerable resources
                            from normal economic activities—a diversion the regime can ill-afford in
                            view of its bare subsistence level economy.</p>
                        <p>5. Assessment of the impact of our air strikes on the attitudes of the
                            North Vietnamese Government and people must continue to be deduced from
                            the relatively small number of reports received by Free World sources
                            and from statements made by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            officials and citizens. Analysis of available evidence leads to the
                            following conclusions: a. The local population in North Vietnam is
                            becoming increasingly aware of our air strikes and a sense of
                            uncertainty has been generated among the populace. Western observers,
                            however, see no signs that the people are pressing the regime for a
                            settlement of the conflict. Rather, the popular reaction to the strikes
                            seems to be that of “grim determination to continue the fight.” In
                            general, the populace appears to be responding favorably to the
                            increased political and military controls imposed by the regime.</p>
                        <p>b. Early in April, Western diplomatic observers described the atmosphere
                            in Hanoi as “fairly relaxed,” although a suggestion of greater anxiety
                            in official statements and in the press was noted. North Vietnam's
                            propaganda output vigorously stresses the theme that the “army and the
                            people” are stirred to profound hatred and are responding positively “to
                            defeat the US aggressors.” The tone of statements emanating from Hanoi
                            gives no inkling that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has
                            weakened in its determination to continue supporting the Viet Cong while
                            persevering in their resistance to US air actions against North Vietnam.
                            Emphasis in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> public statements,
                            however, on the growing opposition within the US to the “aggressive war”
                            being waged by the US may be an indication that the regime's leaders are
                            hoping that the appearance of grim determination on their part and
                            flagging resolve on our part will still permit them to achieve their
                            objectives in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. In summary, our air strikes to date, while magnifying <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> logistic support problems in southern
                            North Vietnam and reducing their current ability to support overt
                            aggression outside their borders, have not reduced their over-all
                            military capabilities in any major sense. Neither have we seriously hurt
                            the North Vietnamese economy. The North Vietnamese regime, with no
                            apparent opposition from its populace, gives every impression of being
                            determined to continue on its present course.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I am returning herewith the letter of the Director of Central
                            Intelligence, dated May 8, 1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d307fn2">
                                <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> together with
                            enclosures.</p>
                        <p>I which to make one major point.</p>
                        <p>I believe our ground forces in South Vietnam should be kept to a minimum,
                            consistent with the protection of our installations and property in that
                            country. My concern is that a substantial buildup of U.S. ground troops
                            would be construed by the Communists, and by the world, as a
                            determination on our part to win the war on the ground.</p>
                        <p>This could be a quagmire. It could turn into an open end commitment on
                            our part that would take more and more ground troops, without a
                            realistic hope of ultimate victory.</p>
                        <p>I do not think the situation is comparable to Korea. The political
                            posture of the parties involved, and the physical conditions, including
                            terrain, are entirely different.</p>
                        <p>I continue to believe that the constant probing of every avenue leading
                            to a possible settlement will ultimately be fruitful. It won't be what
                            we want, but we can learn to live with it.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            follow:</p>
                        <p>1. Indian proposals<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">See <ref target="#d285">Document 285</ref>.</note> involving Cordon Sanitaire by
                            Afro-Asian troops on 17th parallel were not acceptable to Hanoi since
                            they did not respond to situation in which South Vietnamese struggling
                            for freedom and for which Geneva Agreements and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> already existed. (Source dismissed this as usual
                            propaganda position.)</p>

                            (withdrawal US troops, respect for Geneva Accords pending reunification,

                            rather as working principles for negotiation which should in DRVN view
                            represent ultimate goal of settlement in Viet Nam. In response query, Bo
                            said he speaking with authorization his govt. Our source opinion is that
                            Bo was making approach on orders sent from Hanoi as result suspension US

                        <p>1. As a guide to present and future discussions of possible ways to
                            settle the Vietnam question, it may be useful to list a few of the
                            fundamental factors controlling the attitudes of the principal parties
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> objective is to unite the two Vietnams under a Communist
                            regime. They will not give up this objective until it becomes clearly
                            unattainable in the foreseeable future. Even then, they will defer their
                            efforts, not abandon them.</p>
                        <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strategy is now based on accomplishing their objective
                            in three stages stretched over a period of years—first a negotiation
                            between the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and some Government in
                            Saigon for a coalition government; secondly, a take-over of that
                            Government by the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>; and lastly, an
                            integration with the Hanoi regime. They believe they can attain their
                            objective following this track. They cannot be talked or negotiated out
                            of it until they are convinced it is a losing game, particularly since
                                <pb xml:id="pg_675" n="675" facs="0707"/>they feel that at Geneva in
                            1954 they were tricked out of accomplishing this objective which was
                            then within their grasp. They are thus especially wary of “negotiating
                            tricks”.</p>
                        <p>(3) The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> expect that war-weariness, government instability, U.S.
                            sensitivity to domestic and international pressures, and Vietnamese
                            xenophobia will lead to a situation which will shortly permit them to
                            accomplish the first stage, i.e., a coalition government.</p>
                        <p>(4) No amount of bombing of the North is in itself going to persuade the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to abandon their strategy. They can be persuaded to
                            abandon it only if they are convinced that the trend of events in the
                            South is against them and the factors cited above are not panning out.
                            They are not yet convinced that this is the case.</p>
                        <p>(5) The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will never really disband their
                            armed forces in South Vietnam until they are fully in control of the
                            government. They might as a ruse “play dead” without giving up their
                            arms—but that is all. By the same token no extended cease-fire is
                            practical.</p>
                        <p>(6) To the degree that we or the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> seem
                            anxious to negotiate from what the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> still estimate is a
                            position of weakness on our side we encourage the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to
                            continue their present course. To the degree that we can impart to the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> a sense of calm confidence and willingness indefinitely
                            to pursue our present course, the DRV/VC will be encouraged to look for
                            ways out.</p>
                        <p>(7) At such time as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> estimate that the tide has turned against
                            them in South Vietnam it will be important to have a carefully thought
                            out and agreed program that will further induce <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defections, facilitate <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> acceptance of their
                            defeat and “heal the nation's wounds” as promptly as possible.</p>

                            to accommodate those attitudes which are compatible with U.S. objectives
                            and to apply effective leverage on those which must be changed.</p>

                        <p>1. Why do we consider that the Viet Cong would offer the cooperation
                            which is indispensable to the success of this plan?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We agree with the estimate expressed
                            that the Viet Cong will be willing “to submit to heavy punishment rather
                            than give up their long-sought objective of a Communist State covering
                            the whole of Viet-Nam”. We also believe that they consider that their
                            present course of action will bring ultimate success. Hence it is hard
                            to see why, under these circumstances, they would consider it
                            advantageous “to move the conflict from the military to the political
                            arena”.</p>
                        <p>There is the suggestion (Part II. B.) that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> will find the plan
                            attractive because it will fatten the South Vietnamese sheep for the
                            eventual enjoyment of North Vietnamese wolves at a later time. Also
                            there is the implication that this “later time” might come to the Viet
                            Cong as the result of exploiting the political advantages resulting from
                            their infiltration of the South Vietnamese government. However, if this
                            advantage is real enough to convince the Viet Cong that it is worth
                            joining in a cooperative effort with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to rebuild South Viet-Nam, the plan is probably too
                            risky for us to engage in it.</p>
                        <p>2. Will the “carrots” contained in this package be more appealing to the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> than those already suggested and
                            thus far rejected by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>?</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The President has made it fairly clear
                            that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> could participate in many
                            advantages if the leaders ceased their aggression against South
                            Viet-Nam. This offer, coupled possibly with that of political
                            recognition of Hanoi, might seem to be a more attractive package than
                            the risks of cooperating with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            the social and political reconstruction of the country. If such is not
                            the case, we had better reconsider whether we are not risking too much
                            in our own plan.</p>
                        <p>3. Why do we think that the promulgation of a new Plan for Social and
                            Political Reconstruction would offer hope and credibility to either the
                            South Vietnamese or the Viet Cong?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We have been engaging for several years
                            in attempting the social and political reconstruction of South Viet-Nam,
                            utilizing all the ideas and resources which the United States Government
                            has been able to produce. From this experience, we have learned that the
                            success of social, political and economic development is a function of
                            security and effective government. Because of the security factor,
                            conditions are favorable to development only in the cities and about 10
                            provinces; the conditions are spotty in about 22 provinces and are
                            virtually impossible in about 12 provinces. As for the governmental
                            factor, the record shows how feeble governmental performance has been
                            since the fall of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            Performance is getting somewhat better now but still has a long way to
                            go. Out of consideration of these two factors taken in combination, one
                            can see little reason to hope that a newly promulgated program for
                            social and political reconstruction will convince any large number of
                            Vietnamese, north or south, that a new era is at hand and a new deal
                            imminent which is too good to miss.</p>
                        <p>4. What is the precise purpose of the limited pause in military
                            operations?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The paper (VII. A.) merely states the
                            purpose as being “to assure that the other side gives serious attention
                            to the plan”. It is not clear whether, during the pause, the advantages
                            to North Viet-Nam and the Viet Cong would be spelled out specifically by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> spokesmen. As indicated in the
                            discussion of Question 1., the features of the plan which might be
                            considered really attractive to the Viet Cong are such that one could
                            hardly allude to them in public—certainly no <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> official could.</p>
                        <p>5. Under what circumstances during the pause would we revert to military
                            operations? Specifically, if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            merely maintained their normal pattern of behavior, do we continue to
                            respect the pause?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This question arises from the language
                            in Paragraph VII. B. 3 and 4 and D. It seems quite likely that the Viet
                            Cong would not change their pattern of conduct at least for a
                            considerable time. Would this lack of favorable reaction invalidate the
                            entire plan or is it considered feasible to carry on some parts of the
                            plan even without Viet Cong cooperation? It would certainly not be
                            satisfactory to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (nor, we would
                                <pb xml:id="pg_678" n="678" facs="0710"/>suppose, to us) to cease
                            offensive action both in South and North Viet-Nam if the Viet Cong
                            adhere to their present level of aggression.</p>
                        <p>6. Under what circumstances and in what terms would we announce our
                            willingness to withdraw U.S. forces?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is a most sensitive subject for
                            discussion within South Vietnamese hearing. There are always latent
                            fears that the U.S. somehow will wriggle out of commitment to South
                            Viet-Nam. On page 12 [V. C. 6] of the reference paper, there is a
                            reference to a withdrawal of forces “on a phased basis” (assuming proper
                            response from the other side)”. We should be very clear in our own mind
                            what would constitute a “proper response” before opening any discussion
                            of this matter with our allies.</p>
                        <p>7. To what extent will Viet Cong or former Viet Cong be allowed to engage
                            in political activities?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> At the present time, Viet Cong defectors
                            under the Chieu-Hoi program may take part as voters in local elections
                            and, in principle, are not barred as candidates providing they are
                            approved by the proper government authorities. If, however, unreformed
                            Viet Cong are eligible to vote and run for provincial office and for
                            delegates in a constituent assembly we would appear to be tacitly
                            encouraging the eventual creation of the type of coalition government
                            which, on past occasions, we have publicly equated to communization of
                            South Viet-Nam. As we read the paper, we understand that under the
                            amnesty Viet Cong who are willing to cease fighting will be offered full
                            political privileges without renouncing Communism. If this is so, the
                            point will be hard to sell to the CVN who have taken seriously our
                            arguments against popular front governments.</p>
                        <p>8. How does the government go about seeking “to establish its presence
                            with a minimum disruption of local administrative arrangements currently
                            acceptable to local populace”? What functions would government officials
                            attempt to perform in Viet Cong controlled areas?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Paragraph VI. C. seems to indicate that
                            we would accept the status quo insofar as government control or lack of
                            control of population and territory is concerned. On the other hand, in
                            Paragraph VI. E. one contemplates at some point attaining a situation
                            where “the government has effectively extended its authority throughout
                            the country”. As a practical matter, the Viet Cong will never allow
                            government officials to operate in their areas of authority nor is it
                            likely that we will find many government officials willing to try to
                            enter Viet Cong bailiwicks unless amply supported by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> bayonets. Thus, if the thought is
                            that government officials could at a minimum effect the registration of
                            voters country-wide, we consider the possibility highly unlikely.</p>
                        <p>9. When, if ever, would there be a cease-fire and how would it come

                            and of the failure to assure the end of infiltration and to liquidate
                            the Viet Cong military thread within South Viet-Nam. If we mention U.S.
                            withdrawal, they will shy even more. In its present form, it is highly
                            unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would accept the
                            plan without a great deal of unpleasant arm-twisting on the part of the
                            Americans—perhaps not then. Such pressure tactics could only be applied
                            at a very substantial sacrifice of the present good relations existing
                            between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. If the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> yielded to
                            this pressure, it is entirely possible that a military-Catholic
                            coalition would overturn the government.</p>

                            joint coordinating staff might be a useful device, it would not be a
                            good idea to put such a plan forward in the climate of opinion that
                            existed in South Vietnam. “Joint command to the public here means
                            subordination of Vietnamese forces to US command and is obnoxious to
                            national pride.” <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> noted
                            that the Embassy was far from ready to propose anything like the type of
                            plan for a more formal combined command authority noted in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> instruction. (Department of State,

                            telegram 260332Z to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>; ibid.) The
                            Departments of State and Defense agreed in a combined message sent to
                            the Embassy in Saigon on May 27, that no action should be taken to
                            approach the South Vietnamese Government on the question of a combined
                            coordinating staff until it was politically feasible to do so. Any
                            planning for a combined command authority was to be done unilaterally
                            and in “a discreet manner.” (Telegram 2730 to Saigon; ibid.)</p>

                        <p>1. Historically, guerrilla wars have generally been lost or won cleanly:
                            Greece, China mainland, North Viet-Nam, Malaya, Philippines. Laos in
                            1954 was an exception, with two provinces granted the Communists and a
                            de facto split imposed on the country.</p>
                        <p>2. In all the cases won by Free World forces, there was a phase when the
                            guerrillas commanded a good part of the countryside and, indeed, placed
                            Athens, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila under something close to siege. They
                            failed to win because all the possible routes to guerrilla victory were
                            closed and, in failing to win, they lost. They finally gave up in
                            discouragement. The routes to victory are:</p>
                        <p>a) Mao Stage Three: going to all-out conventional war and winning as in
                            China in 1947–49;</p>
                        <p>b) Political collapse and takeover: North Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>c) Political collapse and a coalition government in which the Communists
                            get control over the security machinery; that is, army and/or police.
                            This has been an evident Viet Cong objective in this war; but the
                            nearest precedents are Eastern European takeovers after 1945, rather
                            than guerrilla war cases.</p>
                        <p>d) Converting the bargaining pressure generated by the guerrilla forces
                            into a partial victory by splitting the country: Laos. Also, in a sense,
                            North Viet-Nam in 1954 and the Irish Rebellion after the First World
                            War.</p>
                        <p>3. If we succeed in blocking these four routes to victory, discouraging
                            the Communist force in the South, and making the continuance of the war
                            sufficiently costly to the North there is no reason we cannot win as
                            clear a victory in South Viet-Nam as in Greece, Malaya, and the
                            Philippines. Unless political morale in Saigon collapses and the ARVN
                            tends to break up, case c), the most realistic hope of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, should be avoidable. This danger argues
                            for more rather than less pressure on the North, while conducting the
                            battle in the South in such a way as to make <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> hopes of military and political progress wane.</p>
                        <p>4. The objective of the exercise is to convince Hanoi that its bargaining
                            position is being reduced with the passage of time; for, even in the
                            worst case for Hanoi, it wants some bargaining position (rather than
                            simply dropping the war) to get U.S. forces radically reduced in South
                            Viet-Nam and to get some minimum face-saving formula for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe Hanoi understands its dilemma well. As of early February it
                            saw a good chance of a quite clean victory via route c). It now is
                            staring at quite clear-cut defeat, with the rising U.S. strength and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale in the South and rising
                            costs in the North. That readjustment in prospects is painful; and they
                            won't, in my view, accept its consequences unless they are convinced
                            time has ceased to be their friend, despite the full use of their assets
                            on the ground in South Viet-Nam, in political warfare around the world,
                            and in diplomacy.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_682" n="682" facs="0714"/>
                        <p>6. Their last and best hope will be, of course, that if they end the war
                            and get us out, the political, social, and economic situation in South
                            Viet-Nam will deteriorate in such a way as to permit Communist political
                            takeover, with or without a revival of guerrilla warfare. It is in this
                            phase that we will have to consolidate, with the South Vietnamese, a
                            victory that is nearer our grasp than we (but not Hanoi) may think.</p>

                            hostilities on both sides of 17th parallel, surveillance of “frontiers”
                            of two Vietnams by Afro-Asian force, maintenance of demarcation line)
                            DRVN had asked how North and South Viet Nam could agree on cease-fire
                            since conflict not between Vietnamese but between Americans and
                            Vietnamese. Furthermore, DRVN could not understand how India could

                            unity. Indian proposals would result in “consolidation of division” of
                            Viet Nam; hence, they could only be rejected.</p>

                        <p>3. When asked if Hanoi recognized that realization of its proposed
                            “principle of withdrawal” of American forces would depend upon the

                            that if there were agreement on the “bases”, the “ways and means” of
                            application of “principles” would be found and in peaceful manner;

                            arrest about 40 military and civilian officials who were plotting
                            overthrow of his govt. Since round-up, we have been trying to evaluate
                            pattern and political motivation of those involved. Some of plotters had
                            been connected with earlier attempted coup of February 19<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">See <ref target="#d141">Documents 141</ref> and

                            convicted in absentia. Others have Catholic or Northern connections but,
                            on whole, there seems to be no ground for describing movement as being
                            Catholic or regional in its character. Our overall impression is that
                            conspirators are hodge-podge of individuals and small group disaffected
                            for differing reasons but all responsive to string-pulling of perennial
                            troublemaker, Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_PNT1">Pham Ngoc
                                Thao</persName>. We had warned Quat previously about danger of

                            to plot. Now I believe for first time police are sincerely trying to
                            catch him.</p>
                        <p>This morning (Tuesday, 25 May), Quat finally carried out cabinet changes
                            at which he has been working for several weeks.<note n="4" xml:id="d314fn4">The new cabinet appointments announced by Quat on
                                May 25 included Nguyen Trung Trinh, Minister of Economy; Tran Van
                                Thoan, Minister of Interior; Tran Thanh Hiep, Minister of Labor;
                                Dinh Trinh Chinh, Minister of Information; and Lam Van Tri, Minister
                                of Agricultural Reform.</note> His difficulties in doing so have
                            illustrated delicate balance of relationships holding his govt in place.
                            He may not yet be out of woods as he is still encountering opposition
                            from Chief of State <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>, who up
                            to last minute has been expressing unhappiness at what he feels is
                            Quat's failure to observe required legal niceties in changing his
                            ministers. New members of cabinet include several southerners who, while
                            not well known, should give greater regional balance to govt and will
                            probably bring greater competence to their several ministries than that
                            of weak officials whom they replace.</p>
                        <p>Generals added to Quat's last minute difficulties by repeating past
                            objections to General <persName corresp="#p_MLM1">“Little”

                            evidently felt that he is still not strong enough to challenge any
                            important grouping of generals and agreed to sacrifice Minh. His
                            replacement, General Co, is good man but we are likely to miss
                                <persName>Minh</persName> who was competent professional staff
                            officer of kind not overly abundant in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong, while not notably active during week, conducted two successful
                            ambushes of convoys and appeared to be concentrating attention on lines
                            of communication around Saigon. They interrupted road traffic to Dalat,
                            source of much of fruits and vegetables on Saigon market, and sabotaged
                            several towers on transmission line carrying large part of Saigon's
                            electricity from Danhim hydroelectric complex in Tuyen Duc Province.
                            They can cause us serious trouble if they continue to attack power lines
                            which pass through wild and difficult areas where defense, repair and
                            maintenance of lines are very difficult. If we are looking for reason
                            for retaliatory action against North Vietnamese power plants, we have
                            one in this situation.</p>
                        <p>After several unsuccessful efforts, we have finally got Quat to agree to
                            sit down with us to discuss factors in eventual political settlement. We
                            are initiating this discussion with him tomorrow along with his FonMin.
                            It may be significant that, in his speech today to Legislative Council,
                            Quat emphasized that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must be master
                            of its house in conduct of war and in eventual negotiation of political
                            settlement. While it may be that Quat wished merely to offset
                            anticipated criticism on this score, there is no doubt that he and his
                            ministers are very sensitive to recurring charge that Americans are in
                            control and that Washington is calling shots.</p>

                            settlement of the Vietnam problem”. The points were incorporated in the

                            points appear to be negotiating preconditions—a position which went

                            Hanoi's representative in Paris, had made a “fairly pressing approach”.
                            In essence, Bo stressed that Pham Van Dong's four points were not to be
                            considered as preconditions for negotiations, but rather as “working
                            principles” toward an ultimate settlement. State has indicated its
                            interest, but has told <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
                            that we would not like to see the French involved in the exchange and

                                Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In telegram 2660, the Department
                                informed the Embassy in Saigon that the response being made to the
                                approach by the North Vietnamese in Paris was that the contact might
                                be of some value in the future, but the United States did not want
                                France to be involved in any exchange that might develop.

                            me and in a separate talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>: Pham Van Dong's proposals should be regarded as a
                            serious intent to negotiate; the U.S. should proceed to engage in direct
                            discussions with Hanoi, thus avoiding the complications implicit in the
                            participation of other parties.<note n="5" xml:id="d315fn5">Memorandum

                            direct, private talks with representatives of the Hanoi regime if we get
                            reliable indications that they are ready to talk without

                            views on possible venues for private talks with North Viet Nam, should
                            this lead prove productive, and Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> recommends his capital. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> sees disadvantages in trying to

                        <p>At best, we might be able to isolate Hanoi from Peiping and, with
                            judicious application of carrots, sticks and general bargaining
                            techniques, induce Hanoi to disengage militarily from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and cease its <pb xml:id="pg_688" n="688" facs="0720"/>support and direction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and (hopefully) bring an end to
                            large-scale offensive action by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in
                            the South, in exchange for our suspension of bombing. This could be tied
                            to a second phase of negotiations involving the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, which,
                            especially if the Acheson proposals<note n="7" xml:id="d315fn7">See <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> had taken effect,
                            might lead to a satisfactory political resolution within South Vietnam.
                            The final phase of this process could be a relatively simple one: the
                            ratification of the agreements by the Co-Chairmen of the 1954
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>At worst, negotiations might be undertaken and be broken off in
                            bitterness and hostility. This might make subsequent attempts at a
                            diplomatic resolution more difficult, but this is a risk attendant on
                            any attempt to negotiate. Of less grave import, would be Hanoi's
                            ignoring or turning down our initiative. In this case, we would leak or
                            publicize our approach and the fact that we undertook such a serious and
                            constructive step would buttress the Administration's image domestically
                            and abroad. Finally, even if negotiations are carried out, there is the
                            possibility that we might find, some time after our bombing has ceased,
                            Hanoi was not keeping its part of the bargain and that our bombing would
                            have to be resumed with all the attendant political problems this would
                            raise.</p>

                        <p>If the Acheson plan meets with approval at the highest level, steps
                            should be taken to delay the initiation of direct talks with Hanoi until
                            the plan has been set in motion by Quat. Since the essence of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> scheme is to establish
                            the authority of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> throughout
                            South Vietnam and to offer the Viet Cong a political exit from their
                            insurgency, it is important that this be in train prior to any
                            negotiations with Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>A small group should be established to manage all aspects of our
                            diplomatic-political approach as a full-time highest priority task. This
                            group should be selected with a view that it will provide the nucleus
                            for the US negotiating team. Immediate study should be given to the
                            preparation of a US negotiating track taking into account Hanoi's four
                            points as recently put forward as well as our own position and
                            objectives.</p>

                            to seek further clarification of Bo's initiative.</p>

                            what Hanoi's reactions were to the longer messages we had conveyed in

                        <p>We might in any event be considering a general message for Seaborn to
                            have in the event he has any substantive conversations. However, there
                            is the further possibility that we should use this channel for either or
                            both of the following purposes: (a) to reiterate the substance of our
                            pause message (Tab B attached),<note n="6" xml:id="d316fn6">Printed as
                                    <ref target="#d293">Document 293</ref>.</note> or (b) to
                            indicate our awareness of the Bo message to the French that Pham Van
                            Dong's four points are not to be considered preconditions but rather
                            “working principles” (Tab C attached).<note n="7" xml:id="d316fn7">Printed as <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first possibility, reiterating our pause message, would entail no
                            difficulty and seems desirable in any event, particularly the last
                            paragraph suggesting the possibility of further pauses in the future. We
                            have little doubt that Hanoi actually got this message, but the
                            reiteration of the last paragraph after our resumption would have some
                            weight and might become useful in the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            <note n="8" xml:id="d316fn8">Regarding the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>-Cutler Plan, see <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>. For text of the plan as circulated on May

                            context in the future.</p>
                        <p>The second possibility raises somewhat greater difficulties. Bo's message
                            to the French does state that the four points are not “prior conditions”
                                <pb xml:id="pg_690" n="690" facs="0722"/>but equally it appears to
                            call for recognition of these “principles” as the essential bases for
                            discussion. We certainly do not wish to get into the position of
                            accepting the four points as a basis, but there would be some merit in
                            language to the following effect:</p>

                            by Hanoi as the basis for negotiations were not to be considered prior
                            conditions. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had previously been
                            unable to determine this point and would be interested in whether Hanoi
                            is now prepared for discussions without any conditions whatever, as has
                            been proposed by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>In other words, we could pitch the inquiry on the basis of “unconditional
                            discussions” in the full sense and not on the question of discussions on
                            the basis of the four points. This would not be a change in our basic
                            position, although we should have to weigh whether the inquiry alone
                            would tend to indicate to Hanoi that we were looking for a bilateral
                            forum and a way out. Needless to say, any actual bilateral discussions
                            would have to be weighed very carefully by us, and we would have to
                            consider particularly whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would accept them or react unfavorably if they came to light. Although
                            we have acted on the Bo message to the extent of exploring what the
                            possible venue of bilateral discussions might be (Paris, through
                            clandestine channels, Rangoon, and Vientiane are possibilities), we had
                            been inclined against any initiative toward such discussions at the
                            present moment (largely because we think an action/reaction sequence is
                            more likely to be fruitful).</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, to remain silent in the face of the Bo message could
                            be misconstrued. It is notable that Hanoi, in the Bo message, did use a
                            wholly secret channel. It was probably trying to establish a credible
                            position with the French and it may also have been saying indirectly to
                            us that, if they ever did decide to talk, they would wish to use the
                            French channel and not the Soviets or the British (through whom we had
                            sent the pause message).</p>
                        <p>On balance, I am inclined to think that we should include in Seaborn's
                            kit a paragraph along the lines quoted above.</p>
                        <p>The full text of a possible message to Seaborn incorporating these points
                            is attached at Tab D<note n="9" xml:id="d316fn9">Not printed.</note> for

                        <p>2718. We are considering asking Canadians to instruct Seaborn to bear
                            message to Hanoi, when he leaves May 31, for delivery to senior <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> official if and only if his first
                            contacts with his normal liaison contact, in which he would inquire
                            about availability senior officials, meet with forthcoming response and
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> initiative for appointment. We
                            would not wish Seaborn to press for senior appointment and we would not
                            wish him to deliver at lower liaison level any message other than that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> believes it has made its
                            position clear and continues to await Hanoi's response.</p>
                        <p>Proposed presentation Seaborn would make to senior official would be as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. In my last visit,<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">See <ref target="#d199fn7">footnote 7, Document 199</ref>.</note> I
                            conveyed a statement of US views concerning South Viet-Nam, which
                            followed the lines of what the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            stated to Peiping representatives at Warsaw. That statement, of course,
                            remains valid. Its essential points have been repeated subsequently in
                            public, and it would perhaps be wise to underscore particularly the
                            manifest US determination to persist in the defense of freedom in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and to take those continuing actions
                            which are, in the view of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            justified and made necessary by the continuing aggression of others.</p>
                        <p>2. Since my last visit, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has of
                            course further publicly stated its position in President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s speech of April 7 and in the
                            US reply to the note of the 17 non-aligned nations,<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note>
                            in which the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> further defined its
                            readiness for unconditional discussions, its objectives, and the
                            sequence of actions that might lead to a peaceful solution of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been disappointed to note
                            that actions in the South supported and directed by Hanoi appear to
                            continue without change, and even to be currently intensified. The USG
                            notes that Hanoi expressed no readiness for discussions in its reply to
                            the 17 nonaligned nations, that it responded negatively to the proposal
                            for a conference concerning Cambodia,<note n="4" xml:id="d317fn4">See
                                    <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1965</hi>, p. 716.</note> and that it has been negative toward
                            the recent Indian proposal<note n="5" xml:id="d317fn5">See <ref target="#d285">Document 285</ref>.</note> even as a basis for
                            discussions.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_692" n="692" facs="0724"/>
                        <p>4. In addition, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> informed Hanoi on
                            May 12<note n="6" xml:id="d317fn6">See <ref target="#d293">Document
                                    293</ref>.</note> that it was undertaking a temporary suspension
                            of bombing attacks for a period of several days. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> regrets that this action met with no
                            response from Hanoi neither directly nor in the form of any significant
                            reductions of armed actions in South Viet-Nam by forces whose actions,
                            in the view of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, can be
                            decisively affected from North Viet-Nam. Accordingly, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, in coordination with the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam, was obliged to resume bombing attacks. Nonetheless, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> continues to consider the possibility
                            of working toward a solution by mutual example.</p>
                        <p>5. In making these points, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> again
                            must make it clear that in the absence of action or discussions leading
                            to a political solution it must and will take whatever actions may be
                            necessary to meet and to counter the offensive actions being carried out
                            by North Viet-Nam against South Viet-Nam and against American forces
                            acting to assist the Republic of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>6. If but only if senior DRV representative gets on to Pham Van Dong four
                            points of April 8,<note n="7" xml:id="d317fn7">See <ref target="#d245">Document 245</ref>.</note> Seaborn would reply that he has no
                            message from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on this subject.
                            However, his study of four points would indicate that some might be
                            acceptable to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> but that others would
                            clearly be unacceptable. It has also not been clear whether <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> statements should be taken to mean that
                            the recognition of these points was required as, in effect, a condition
                            for any discussions. He would say that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> appears to have made its position clear, that it would
                            accept unconditional discussions in the full sense, with either side
                            free to bring up any matter, and that he would be personally interested
                            in whether the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> representative wished
                            to clarify the question of whether their recognition is regarded by the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as a condition to any
                            discussions. End proposed text.</p>
                        <p>In presenting these instructions to the Canadians, we would explain that
                            paragraph 4 represents a reiteration of the message conveyed to Hanoi at
                            the time of the pause, and that paragraph 6 is an attempt to elicit
                            clarification on the repeated DRV formulation of the four points. At the
                            same time, we have not wished to appear to be taking any real new
                            initiative for discussion. You will note also that the formulation, as
                            well as the explanation to the Canadians, makes no reference to the
                            recent Bo approach in Paris,<note n="8" xml:id="d317fn8">See <ref target="#d313">Document 313</ref>.</note> on which we have not
                            informed the Canadians and which we would not wish to seem to be picking
                            up as such. At the same time, part of the reason for paragraph 6 is that
                            we have some concern that the Bo approach might have been designed to
                            have the French pass the word in diplomatic channels that Hanoi is
                            actually ready for discussions <pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0725"/>without prior conditions, which might invite some unhelpful initiative
                            by the French or perhaps by <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U
                                Thant</persName> or others. If Seaborn should in fact use paragraph
                            6 and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> representative should
                            respond that acceptance of the four points is a necessary precondition,
                            we would have learned something; equally, it would indicate what might
                            be a significant change if Hanoi should take a different position. We
                            suppose that the former would be the result, based on our over-all
                            reading of Hanoi's position at this time, but at least the point would
                            be somewhat better nailed down.</p>
                        <p>Request your comments on this whole approach. If you concur, we should be
                            going ahead with the Canadians tomorrow if possible so that instructions
                            could reach Seaborn in time.<note n="9" xml:id="d317fn9">In telegram

                            provided by the Soviet Union. (Washington National Records Center,

                            381) The Joint Chiefs considered that, although the offensive threat
                            posed by the bombers was limited, “a failure to act could connote a <pb xml:id="pg_694" n="694" facs="0726"/>weakening of US resolve to

                            involved in the proposed operations, as well as the risk of an
                            embarrassing international reaction to such attacks.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>-STATE) The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> responded on June 2 with <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–6–65, “Probable Communist
                            Reactions to Certain US Actions”, which concluded that the probable
                            Soviet, Chinese and North Vietnamese reactions would be limited, and
                            would not involve direct Chinese intervention nor a North Vietnamese
                            invasion of the south. The Department of State dissented from the
                            conclusion, and anticipated that the proposed attacks might prompt a
                            response from air bases in mainland China. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>

                            North Vietnamese aircraft include a caution against attacking air bases
                            or other ground targets that were not on the designated target list.
                            (Ibid., Rusk Files: Lot 72 D 192, Telephone Calls) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> returned the call on May 28

                            which I had previously given to Quat. On the whole, it was a useful
                            exchange. It was evident that they had not done much fundamental
                            thinking on these problems. On the other hand they appeared quite
                            realistic in their assessment of the situation and on prospects for
                            achieving objectives for an eventual settlement. We were successful in
                            introducing the major elements of our thinking and in eliciting a
                            favorable or open-minded response on their part. We will have to see
                            where we come out when we get down to specifics. I have the impression
                            that certain of Quat's expressions of concern over sensitivity of
                            Vietnamese political situation and public opinion stem in part from
                            current constitutional battle with <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>. (Which was obviously on his mind throughout the

                            following are points, which I believe may be of interest.</p>
                        <p>At outset they stated broad GVN political objectives were restoration of
                            peace with liberty, full sovereignty and independence of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. They noted reunification impossible at
                            present and necessary accept division at 17th parallel until
                            international situation permits further consideration reunification.
                            They were firm that National Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>) merely creature of Hanoi and <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> cannot accept NLF as element in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> administration; that is, as a bloc or political force
                            or organization. However, they acknowledged provision would have to be
                            made for integration returnees into national life as individuals. Agreed
                            that major steps need be taken to revitalize and expand Chieu Hoi
                            program and to promote defections.</p>
                        <p>We responded with statement general political objectives as set forth in
                            answer to question 1, <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 3678,
                            noting these interrelated and <pb xml:id="pg_696" n="696" facs="0728"/>that “security guarantee” is theme running through all objectives and
                            raises basic questions as to whether <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US should seek restoration status quo ante or seek new
                            international framework. This promoted lengthy discussion of: (A)
                            suitability of Geneva Accords as basis for eventual settlement; and (B)
                            importance and nature of security guarantees. Regarding (A) initial
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction strongly negative with
                            their citing problem of elections, ineffectiveness of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, prohibition of alliances, and their
                            desire interpret Accords as armistice between French and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> but not as political document governing
                            future <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. They saw advantage of
                            Accords in designation of 17th parallel as boundary and possibly with
                            respect to eventual regroupment and repatriation of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. However, in the ensuing discussion they
                            came around considerably and agreed that elections really presented
                            little difficulty, that ICC problem secondary one, and problem of
                            prohibition of alliances presented greatest difficulty but not
                            impossible of solution. Question was raised whether a security guarantee
                            by US need be considered an alliance. Quat himself suggested further
                            consideration of formula using Geneva Accords as acceptable basis for
                            settlement providing certain provisions of Accords are modified or
                            reinterpreted to bring them in line with current realities. We will
                            return to this in later discussions.</p>
                        <p>With respect to security guarantees they drew parallel between
                            “guaranteed or armed peace” under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            after World War II and situation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            where no muscle provided to guarantee peace postulated under Geneva
                            Accords. They felt <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> ineffective
                            to date and felt something strong essential. While they dwelt on
                            multilateral guarantees, it was clear that they were primarily
                            interested in obtaining bilateral security guarantee from the United
                            States. They indicated this might take form of bilateral arrangements
                            under which US would intervene at request of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the event <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            security were threatened. We pointed out that problem of SEATO unanimity
                            was dealt with in <persName>Rusk</persName>-Thanat communiqué of

                            Without commitment, we undertook to examine with Washington whether that

                            necessity of pushing on all fronts to convince Hanoi that everything of

                            developments as recent moratorium on air attacks,

                            sensitivity also displayed over when and how US troops might be

                        <p>Extended discussion involved modalities reaching eventual settlement
                            either through tacit arrangement or through more formal discussions or
                            negotiations of an official character. They saw distinct advantages in
                            tacit arrangement but acknowledged difficulties in predicting how
                            confrontation of viewpoints with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            could be arranged, as indicated Embtel 3914,<note n="7" xml:id="d319fn7">Dated May 27. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> they felt it was in many ways desirable for
                            US initiate contacts with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Here
                            again they expressed concern because of sensitivity of Vietnamese
                            political situation and public opinion. With respect to more open
                            official contacts the following were discussed briefly: (A) Direct
                            negotiations between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; (B) direct negotiations between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> accompanied by US and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Communist China; and (C) a larger formal conference
                            of Geneva type. While recognizing that ultimate choice of means would
                            depend on situation as it evolves, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would prefer the order as listed above. The larger conference was
                            considered least desirable since question <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representation would prove most difficult to handle
                            under this formula. However, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            representatives indicated they could live with <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives as an integral part of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> delegation.</p>
                        <p>Considerable discussion revolved around question 3 A on what we should

                            and eventual reduction US forces. While it agreed that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US basically desired cessation of

                            our side in exchange in view of difficulties in verifying <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> performance. Agreed we should not trade

                            inconclusive and marked again by sensitivity that US would at some stage
                            expect to withdraw troops.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of question 3 B confirmed judgment that in general it
                            desirable to probe DRV attitudes and intentions and perhaps easier for
                            us to do this. Agreed that such contacts should proceed from solid,
                            agreed US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position. Radhakhrishnan
                            proposals discussed under this heading which reported separately (Embtel

                        </p>
                        <p>Regarding question 3 C <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reps expressed
                            general preference for matching specific offers to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to evidence of good <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> behavior, although GVN could say
                            publicly that it is prepared to study at proper time general types of
                            exchanges (commercial, cultural, individuals, etc.) with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. They noted difficulty speaking out on
                            this subject at early stage since Quat's opponents likely to label
                            speakers as “neutralists”. <pb xml:id="pg_698" n="698" facs="0730"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> confirmed it could accept principle
                            of reunification but stated that reunification would have to await more
                            favorable international political climate. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can accept co-existence with DRV but not
                            co-habitation.</p>
                        <p>Questions 3 D, 3 E, and 3 F were explored during above discussions but no
                            specific conclusions were reached.</p>
                        <p>Under question 3 G importance of Afro-Asian conference stressed. Agreed
                            that additional measures which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could
                            take would be to dramatically increase its diplomatic and public
                            information efforts abroad. In general believed that continued display
                            our determination and firm adherence to our course of action against
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would have greater impact on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> than public statements.</p>
                        <p>Questions 3 H, 3 I, and 3 J having been explored generally were held over
                            for subsequent amplification.</p>
                        <p>In discussion question 3 K, it was agreed that not necessary for US and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> say precisely the same things
                            but that we should consult closely and in particular coordinate
                            positions on any new departures.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, agreed that fundamental point regarding further discussion
                            was following: Assuming desire on part of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to reach agreement up to what point can <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/US justify continued bombing of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> as means of forcing dissolution of VC
                            structure in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>

                            has had to be postponed, we are sending following observations which may
                            be helpful in preparing thoughts you will be presenting to us on
                            rescheduled visit.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_699" n="699" facs="0731"/>
                        <p>In general we see little serious disparity between position <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> leaders and ourselves. We agree with
                            penultimate paragraph that it in fact important for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> posture as sovereign independent
                            government that it take its own position, as long as we are in close and
                            constant consultation and understand each other on important
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>Specific comments follow:</p>
                        <p>1. There continues to be active interest here in making of Chieu Hoi
                            program as effective instrument as possible in pursuing struggle against
                            Communists. We will be anxious to learn of conclusions Mission reaches
                            in consultation with special group from Washington which has been
                            looking into problem and we still ready to help with personnel or funds
                            as necessary to maximize program's effectiveness. We realize one central
                            problem related to Chieu Hoi is probably that of effecting major reform
                            in prisoner treatment and rehabilitation and we will be interested in
                            your recommendations as to how top government officials and military can
                            be persuaded this must be done.</p>
                        <p>2. Re Geneva Accords, you should of course continue pursue line that
                            these should form basis for eventual settlement, since any other line
                            would be politically damaging and in fact we feel that Accords offer us
                            several advantages and pose no insuperable problems. We are looking into
                            possible application <persName>Rusk</persName>-Thanat communiqué to
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and will let you know
                            results.</p>
                        <p>3. Ref to “pushing on all fronts to convince Hanoi that everything of
                            value in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will be destroyed” not
                            clear. Is it meant to refer to importance of credibility of threat as
                            influence on Hanoi's readiness turn to negotiations or does it relate to
                            judgment about how military action against North should develop in
                            future, with regard to intensity as well as location and character of
                            targets?</p>
                        <p>4. Believe you can adequately reassure <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on question US troop withdrawal since this is an action
                            which we would not be taking without full consultation with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and not until we are satisfied that
                            northern aggression no longer a threat and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capable handling security problem in South. In any case
                            we envisage phased withdrawal capable being timed or even reversed in
                            response developments.</p>
                        <p>5. Re modalities for reaching settlement we can envisage, if tacit
                            arrangement being pursued, situations in which it might at no point be
                            necessary to have confrontation of viewpoints with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> even though some formal meeting to put
                            international stamp of approval on settlement might be required.</p>
                        <p>6. With reference question 3G agree that actions will certainly speak
                            louder than words with <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. However,
                            their own statements make it quite clear that Viet Cong and Peking and
                            almost surely Hanoi as well are counting on governmental pressure
                            (abroad) and private protest (at home) against US policies and actions
                            to deter us from pursuing our <pb xml:id="pg_700" n="700" facs="0732"/>objectives as fully and vigorously as may be necessary. More effective
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efforts around the world, if
                            such did not too seriously tax personal resources needed at home, could
                            make significant contribution to our joint efforts. As you are aware,
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Embassy Washington virtually a
                            cipher and we are contemplating measures to bring about improvement. In
                            considering public relations problem either here or in Saigon we are
                            reminded again of Dang Duc Khoi and wonder if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> prepared put him back to work.</p>

                        <p>On May 31 Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi called in British Charge
                            Hopson in Peking and delivered a verbal message to be transmitted to the
                            United States. This was the same message, Chen explained, that Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had asked
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Ayub Khan</persName> of Pakistan to
                            deliver when they met in Peking on April 2. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Ayub</persName>'s scheduled trip to Washington had been postponed
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was concerned that the
                            message had not been transmitted. Consequently, Chen asked Hopson to
                            transmit the four-point message through London to Washington:</p>
                        <p>1. China will not provoke war with the United States</p>
                        <p>2. What China says counts</p>
                        <p>3. China is prepared</p>
                        <p>4. If the United States bombs China that would mean war and there would
                            be no limits to the war.</p>
                        <p>Chen expanded upon these four points in an interview of over an hour. He
                            indicated that China supported Vietnam unconditionally and viewed
                            aggression against Vietnam as aggression against China. But he added
                            that China would take direct part in the conflict only “if the war was
                            expanded to Chinese territory.” Hopson reported the message and the
                            interview in telegrams to London on May 31 and June 1.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy in Washington passed copies of the telegrams to the
                            Department of State on June 2. (Department of State, Ball Papers: Lot 72
                            D 272, Vietnam (Misc IV)) On June 4 <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> sent copies of the telegrams to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> with a covering note indicating
                            that the Chinese message was so interesting that the President would <pb xml:id="pg_701" n="701" facs="0733"/>want to read the telegrams
                            himself. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s impression was that it
                            was a relatively defensive message, and <persName>Bundy</persName> added
                            that his own appreciation was mixed: “The basic trouble with the message
                            is that it does not tell us at all at what point the Chinese might move
                            in Vietnam itself in a way which would force us to act against China.
                            And that of course is the $64 question.” (Johnson Library, National
                            Security File, Memos to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, Vol. XI) On June 5
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> also sent the President an assessment of
                            the message prepared in the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence
                            and Research. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In a June 4 memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 5,
                            to discuss developments in Vietnam and “the appropriate shape of an
                            answer to the Chinese.” <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that, in
                            addition to the President and himself, participation in the meeting be
                            limited to <persName>Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                            and possibly Raborn. (Ibid.) According to the log maintained in the
                            White House, such a meeting took place on June 5 at the Department of
                            State over lunch. (Ibid., President's Daily Diary) No other record of
                            that meeting has been found. In a memorandum to

                            informed the British Embassy that Hopson should be authorized to reply
                            to the Chinese that the United States had received the message. (Ibid.,

                        <p>3989. For the President. We have spent most of the last week trying to
                            work out a solution to the political impasse which arose when Quat tried
                            to reorganize his cabinet.<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">The developing
                                political crisis in Saigon prompted extensive reporting from the
                                Embassy during the last week in May. Telegrams 3902 from Saigon, May
                                26; 2712 to Saigon, May 26; 3931 from Saigon, May 28; 3953 from
                                Saigon, May 29; and 3978 from Saigon, May 31 all dealt with the
                                political impasse. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15

                            Quat evidently did not have his ducks properly aligned when he held a
                            public ceremony last Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d322fn3">May 25.</note>
                            to introduce the new members of this cabinet to the National Legislative
                            Council and Chief of State Suu. He had neglected to obtain the
                            resignations of two ministers he was dropping for incompetence and
                                incompatibility,<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">Minister of Economy
                                Vinh and Minister of Interior Hiep.</note> and he had not
                            anticipated that Suu would yield to the urgings of disaffected
                            southerners, militant refugee Catholics, and out-politicians to
                            interpose constitutional objections to the PriMin's right to fire
                            Cabinet members. The provisional Charter of October 20, 1964,<note n="5" xml:id="d322fn5">The text of the provisional charter was transmitted

                            it seems pretty clearly the intent of the drafters that the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would have the right to choose
                            and dismiss his ministers and that the Chief of State would have no
                            right of interposition. The confrontation between <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> which at the outset seemed little more than a
                            misunderstanding susceptible of prompt settlement has now become an open
                            battle between the followers of the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and the Chief of State with the goal of the latter
                            the fall of the Quat Govt.</p>
                        <p>Because of this situation, I felt obliged to postpone my return to
                            Washington until it can be resolved—how long or how short this delay
                            will be is hard to say. We have been meeting with the principal
                            contenders daily to urge that the crisis be solved quickly and to
                            impress on all concerned the over-riding importance of political
                            stability at this time of increasing U.S. commitment and support.</p>
                        <p>The impasse has been another reminder of the basic lack of cohesion among
                            the Vietnamese and of the irresponsibility of many of their leaders.</p>
                        <p>The impatience of the military with this state of affairs was made clear
                            by Air Force Commander General <persName corresp="#p_Ky1">Ky</persName>
                            in an after-dinner speech made in the presence of Quat and other
                            civilian leaders; in effect, Ky warned that the generals would feel
                            forced to resume political power if the civilians did not soon resolve
                            their differences. The danger of military intervention will grow the
                            longer the confrontation drags on.</p>
                        <p>A hopeful sign in this otherwise darkened political scene was the
                            generally successful carrying out of municipal and provincial elections
                            on Sunday. Although results from the provinces are not yet all in, it
                            looks as though about 70 per cent of those registered exercised their
                            vote. I visited some of the polling places in Saigon and while there was
                            no air of great excitement, the voting was orderly and seemed well
                            conducted. Present plans call for an electoral law to be promulgated by
                            the end of <pb xml:id="pg_703" n="703" facs="0735"/>June for elections
                            to a national assembly to be held in October. Reports from Sunday's
                            elections seem to show that voting in populated areas is feasible and
                            that the Viet Cong are not a serious obstacle to balloting.</p>
                        <p>The upward trend in military activity which began last month continued
                            during the early part of the week and peaked sharply at its end. There
                            was a general increase of attacks, ambushes and sabotage of roads and
                            bridges. Most of the increased activity occurred in the I and II Corps
                            areas and reached a climax two days ago in the combat near Ba Gia, not
                            far from Quang Ngai city. This was a sharp fight in which govt forces
                            came out second best with two <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            battalions decimated. There were disturbing indications of failures of
                            leadership on the part of a number of key officers in the second
                            division from which the troops came. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> is having a close
                            analysis made of this action to learn all possible from it. It may prove
                            to be the opening engagement of the offensive which we have suspected
                            the VC to be preparing during recent quiet weeks.</p>

                            additional $89 million for fiscal year 1966 for the Agency for
                            International Development. The additional funds were requested for the
                            expanded program of economic and social development in Southeast Asia
                            that had been outlined in the President's speech at Johns Hopkins

                            additional appropriation, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> noted that his personal representative, former

                        <p>2769. To Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> only from Under Secretary. We have now
                            reached a point in planning for successive Rolling Thunder operations
                            where we must be clear as to precisely what we are trying to do.</p>
                        <p>In broad terms, there are two possible approaches to the Vietnamese
                            struggle:</p>
                        <p>I. The major premise of the first approach is that the war must be won in
                            the South. Under this approach, airstrikes in the North should be
                            regarded as ancillary to our operations in the principal theater. Such
                            air strikes should be designed to achieve three purposes:</p>
                        <p>A. To raise morale in South Viet-Nam and give credibility to our
                            intention to stay the course.</p>
                        <p>B. To lower the morale of the North Vietnamese and to create concern in
                            Hanoi that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might extend its
                            bombing so as greatly to increase the costs of trying to overrun <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> by military means.</p>
                        <p>C. To harass supply lines and reduce the ability of North Viet-Nam to
                            conduct effective infiltration of men and materials.</p>
                        <p>II. The second approach places much greater emphasis on the total
                            contribution of the air attacks in the North to the ultimate decision.
                            Under this approach our air offensive would so be designed as to impose
                            increasing pressure on the North Vietnamese until they stopped their
                            action against the South even though we might not be winning the war in
                            the South.</p>
                        <p>The distinction between these two approaches has direct relevance to the
                            conduct of the air offensive. Since, under the first approach, it is
                            assumed that the war must ultimately be decided in the South, we should
                            avoid those North Vietnamese targets (such as those in the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong area) that would be most likely to trigger a greater
                            Chinese and Soviet intervention. If, as suggested in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 768,<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">Reference is to telegram 3768 from Saigon, May 15, in which the
                                Embassy reported that Buddhist leader <persName corresp="#p_TQ1">Tri
                                    Quang</persName> had told Embassy officers that he believed that
                                the psychological lift achieved by the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam
                                and the landing of U.S. troops in South Vietnam was wearing off.
                                (Ibid.)</note> the tonic effect of bombing on South Viet-Nam morale
                            is wearing off, do you believe that this effect would be heightened by
                            intensifying the bombing of North Viet-Nam even though it might bring a
                            larger Chinese and Soviet involvement?</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_705" n="705" facs="0737"/>
                        <p>If on the other hand, we accept the logic of the second proposal, we
                            should presumably be prepared to assume greater risks of Chinese and
                            Soviet involvement in an effort to persuade Hanoi to stop. This means
                            that we might logically proceed, within the relatively near future, to
                            bomb the military installations in the Hanoi-Haiphong area. Such an
                            action would seek to achieve the ultimate US objective without the need
                            to depend on victory in the South which would make the risks of a
                            greater Moscow-Peiping involvement worth assuming.</p>
                        <p>The relevance of all this to the present situation is obvious. Action
                            against <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> by US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces has now reached a critical
                            point. We must decide whether to proceed on one of the three following
                            courses:</p>
                        <p>The first is to continue progressively to move northward in our air
                            attacks, recognizing that any further movement nearer the Hanoi-Haiphong
                            area poses grave danger of a serious encounter with <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>s that could draw us into attacks on
                                <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> bases and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites and the attendant possibility of
                            greater Chinese and Russian involvement. In fact, the Rolling Thunder
                            operations, for several weeks, have been in areas where the MIGs might
                            easily have engaged. Their failure to do so (except once) may well be
                            because they are waiting for the early activation of the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites. Attacks on Haiphong and Hanoi
                            could be expected to offer the same dangers as strikes on the <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> bases.</p>
                        <p>A second possibility is to move northward but keep far enough west of the
                            Hanoi-Haiphong area to avoid the range of the SAMs. This would be on the
                            assumption—not yet proven—that this course would offer less danger of
                            escalation. We would like your comments on the validity of this
                            assumption. Would the Chinese permit us to approach nearer their
                            territory without reacting?</p>
                        <p>A third possibility is to expand the present rules to include industrial
                            and other non-military targets that would not entail high civilian
                            casualty rates. This course would permit a continuation of bombing south
                            of the 20th Parallel without providing reactions appreciably different
                            from attacks on the present target systems.</p>
                        <p>In order to make these decisions we need your answers to the following
                            questions:</p>
                        <p>1. Do you believe that our best hope is to seek to win the war in the
                            South while employing air attacks in the North for the ancillary
                            purposes outlined in assumption I above maintaining approximately the
                            same level and geographical scope of bombing as Rolling Thunder programs
                            to date?</p>
                        <p>2. Do you now believe that, in view of the military and political
                            difficulties in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> we should begin to
                            shape our air effort against the North more in the direction of
                            assumption II above?</p>
                        <p>3. Do you believe that we would have a reasonable chance of persuading
                            Hanoi to quit by increasing the destructiveness of our air attacks <pb xml:id="pg_706" n="706" facs="0738"/>so long as the Viet Cong were
                            winning or at least holding their own in the South? If so, do you
                            believe that such pressure could be mounted without unacceptable risks
                            to the United States from an enlarged Soviet/Chinese involvement?</p>
                        <p>4. Taking into account your answers to the above questions, how do you
                            apply these answers to the requested authorization for Rolling Thunder

                            North be run daily or intermittently?</p>

                                North Vietnam.</note> Their views follow:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>: He does not
                            believe that it is necessary for either political or military reasons to
                            strike the bombers now or in the immediate future. Such an action would
                            carry with it a high risk of escalation. He suggests it would be well
                            for the U.S. to inform the Soviets, through appropriate private
                            channels, that we view the introduction of these aircraft with great
                            concern, and if they are used to strike our forces or military or
                            civilian centers of the South Vietnamese, we would find it necessary to
                            respond with great force. He emphasized the absolute necessity of “prior
                            consultation” with the British in the event we do carry out a strike on
                            Phuc Yen.</p>
                        <p>General Lemnitzer: So long as there are no more than a small number of
                            IL28's in North Vietnam (I reported to him that at present we estimate
                            there are approximately 9 aircraft at Phuc Yen), he would be inclined to
                            defer a strike against them. When the number becomes large and
                            militarily significant General Lemnitzer would strike to destroy them.
                            In his opinion, the Soviets would not respond to a U.S. strike against
                            Phuc Yen with overt military action in Western Europe—they might harass
                            the corridors to Berlin, and in that event General Lemnitzer would
                            suggest we harass their seaborne commerce.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>: He does not
                            believe the Soviets will allow the bombers to be used initially against
                            Saigon or other civilian targets in South Vietnam. For this and other
                            reasons, he recommends against attacking the IL28's until they move
                            south of the 17th parallel. If and when they do so, we should hit back
                            hard. He said it would be a tossup as to how the Soviets would react if
                            we strike the IL28's before they move south of the demarcation line. He
                            pointed out the Soviets are in a bad spot: They do not want to become
                            involved in the war in Southeast Asia, but they do have to protect their
                            position in the Communist world, and the current regime does not have
                            the stability of Khrushchev's. In the event we did strike first, he
                            doubts that the Soviets would start any military action in Europe
                            because they would recognize that to do so “would be committing suicide
                            for fear of death.” And he does not believe they would go to war in the
                            Far East because they would think such action would lead to war in
                            Europe. Their military reaction would probably be slight, but the
                            international reaction to our move would be very bad, e.g., we would
                            probably lose the support of the British. He made exactly the same
                            suggestion as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>,
                            i.e., couldn't we get word to the Soviets that if the IL28's are used
                            against us or against the South Vietnamese, “we will blast you.”</p>

                            for the fact that the thrust of the bombings from this time onward ran

                        <p>At the Leadership meeting this morning, the President was quite
                            optimistic about settling the Dominican situation but very pessimistic
                            about Viet Nam. He said the Joint Chiefs and others within his circle
                            have advocated the bombing of Hanoi and he has stalled them off for a
                            week, at least, because he wants to wait until <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> gets back and get his
                            recommendations, and also because he fears this would bring China into
                            the struggle. He said that this would create, almost literally, a Cuba
                            for China and I agreed with him.</p>
                        <p>He said that there are no indications of any feelers from the other side,
                            that the Russians are shipping a lot of stuff, some of which is getting
                            through to North Viet Nam but the Chinese are holding up a good deal of
                            the material. He said we haven't got many more targets left to bomb,
                            that, in fact, they got most of them on the first strike and that the
                            difficult period was now beginning with the monsoons.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_LRB1">Long</persName> spoke up and said we
                            have to face up to the $64.00 question and bomb China. I said as
                            emphatically as I could, “I disagree with you completely and
                            absolutely.”</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to another subject.</p>
                        <p>After watching the blast-off and a discussion of a few legislative
                            matters, I started to leave and the President said, “When <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> gets back I want to talk to you
                            about that area.” I said I would be delighted and left.<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">An additional sentence is handwritten at the bottom

                                <ref target="#d324">Document 324</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. In answer to your questions, we do not see here that the line between
                            the two possible approaches set forth in reftel is quite as sharp as it
                            comes out in that telegram. The air campaign in the North and the
                            anti-Viet Cong campaign in the South are, in our thinking, two parts of
                            a single coherent program. The air attacks have as their primary
                            objectives the termination of Hanoi's support for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> whereas the campaign in South Vietnam has
                            as its primary objective the destruction of the Viet Cong military
                            apparatus within the country. In addition to their primary objectives,
                            each program reacts upon the other. Thus, the anti-Viet Cong effort is
                            made easier by any reduction of infiltration, and the will of Hanoi is
                            sapped by evidence of failure of the Viet Cong effort in the South.
                            Viewed in this light, there should be no question of holding back the
                            air strikes in the North while maximizing the in-country campaign
                            against the Viet Cong (Approach I) or of stepping up the air strikes to
                            compensate for the deficiencies of the in-country program (Approach II).
                            Rather, both should be maximized concurrently, not only for the purpose
                            of attaining their primary objectives, but for the collateral effects in
                            support of one another.</p>
                        <p>2. In further comment on Approach II, we should like to make very clear
                            that we do not believe that any feasible amount of bombing of the North
                            is of itself likely to cause the DRV to cease and desist in its actions
                            in the South. Such a change in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            attitudes can probably be brought about only when, along with a sense of
                            mounting pain from the bombings, there is also a conviction on their
                            part that the tide has turned or soon will turn against them in the
                            South. Obviously these two conditions have not yet been met and our job
                            in the coming months will be to bring them about. This may take a long
                            time and we should not expect quick results. Holding this view, we do
                            not here sense that our action against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces has
                            yet reached a “critical point” in the sense that we must sharply change
                            the pattern and objectives of our attacks against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We do think, however, that the pattern
                            should be constantly evolving. Our air actions against Hanoi should
                            always be on an ascending scale expressed both in weight of effort and
                            geographical <pb xml:id="pg_711" n="711" facs="0743"/>location of
                            targets. It is true that the last two Rolling Thunders have had single
                            targets progressively somewhat closer to the Hanoi-Haiphong area, but in
                            general after commencing Rolling Thunder attacks, we quickly reached a
                            plateau which is still being maintained. Also as set forth in our <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 3753,<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">Dated May 13. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country
                                File, Vietnam, Vol. XXXIV, Cables)</note> we feel that the pattern
                            should be somewhat more random. This thought was to some extent
                            incorporated in Rolling Thunder 16 and weather has also contributed by
                            forcing on us a more random pattern. We understand that weather will be
                            an increasing factor in the coming months.</p>
                        <p>3. If our assumptions with respect to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            reactions are correct, there is no strategy that can bring about a quick
                            solution, but rather our strategy must be based upon a patient and
                            steady increase of pressure following an escalating pattern while making
                            maximum effort to turn the tide here in the South. This does not mean
                            that we must “win” in the South to bring about a change in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attitudes, but rather the DRV must
                            perceive that the tide has turned or is likely soon to turn. Hopefully
                            at this point the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will seek to find
                            some way out, and if and when it does, there could be a “bandwagon”
                            effect that would so lower VC morale and so raise that of South Vietnam
                            as to permit bringing major hostilities to a reasonable early
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>4. In extension of the foregoing observations, we would answer your
                            questions as follows:</p>
                        <p>(A) Question No. 1—We do not believe in employing air attacks in the
                            North for purposes precisely as expressed in Approach I. In particular,
                            with regard to No. I-B, we would not take as our purpose to “create
                            concern in Hanoi that the U.S. Government might extend its bombing so as
                            greatly to increase the costs of trying to overrun South Vietnam by
                            military means”. This statement suggests that a fear of possible
                            consequences alone is our main purpose, whereas it seems to us that
                            there must be actual pain inflicted by attacks and, in addition, the
                            fear of increased pain in order to have maximum effect in changing
                            Hanoi's behavior. Of course, we would also like to raise morale in the
                            South and lower morale in the North, but these benefits are coincidental
                            to the drive on the Hanoi will to continue to support the Viet Cong.
                            Also, we would like to do as much as possible in the harassment of
                            supply lines to reduce effective infiltration, but we recognize and
                            accept the impossibility of attaining this objective except to a limited
                            degree.</p>
                        <p>(B) Question No. 2—We do not believe that we should re-shape our air
                            effort with the idea that increased bombing will compensate for losses
                            on the military and political fronts in the South. On the other hand, we
                            would not cease to apply the kind of mounting pressure described in <pb xml:id="pg_712" n="712" facs="0744"/>paragraph 2 above. While we
                            should do everything possible to win on both fronts, North and South, we
                            should not let up in the North because things are not going well in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>(C) Question No. 3—As we have indicated above, the chance of persuading
                            Hanoi to lay off while the Viet Cong are winning or holding their own in
                            the South is obviously not good. However, we repeat that this fact is no
                            reason to limit the bombing effort in the North. It simply means that we
                            must try harder in the South while bearing down on the North. It is
                            impossible to say whether added pressure would create unacceptable risks
                            of an enlarged Soviet-Chinese involvement except in terms of specific
                            targets. Obviously, any extension of the present target system should be
                            examined closely for [<hi rend="italic">from</hi>] this point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>(D) Question No. 4—In consideration of our views expressed above, we have
                            recommended the approval of Rolling Thunder 17 (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 4004).<note n="4" xml:id="d328fn4">Dated June 2. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        </p>
                        <p>5. With respect to the method of carrying out authorized strikes, the
                            present pattern is generally satisfactory to us. We need approximately
                            48 hours, from receipt of the execution order to bombs on target, for me
                            to clear with the Prime Minister and General Westmoreland the Minister
                            of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. A two-week program is preferable to a one-week
                            program. Desirably, operating units should receive the warning order one
                            week prior to execution in order to permit adequate planning. A two-week
                            program with execution delegated to the operation level would provide
                            flexibility in coping with the vagaries of the weather and other
                            factors, including in-country competition for sorties. Whether strikes
                            are made daily or intermittently would not seem to be significant, but
                            experience suggests that more frequent strikes by fewer aircraft reduces
                            losses. Additionally, varied and repeated strikes serve to complicate
                            the problem for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> defenses.</p>
                        <p>6. In addition to answering your questions, we would like to make some
                            specific comments on targeting, derived from the three courses of action
                            discussed in reftel. As we understand these three courses of action, the
                            first involves a progressive movement northward without consideration
                            for the sensitivity of the Hanoi/Haiphong area; the second moves
                            northward but sideslips to the west, and perhaps to the east, to avoid
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s; and the third confines our
                            efforts south of the 20th parallel but includes industrial or
                            non-military targets.</p>
                        <p>7. In consonance with the concept earlier expressed, it is important that
                            we constantly add to the pressure on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. If we continue to concentrate on lines of
                            communications as in the past, the very repetition of our actions
                            designed to disrupt and maintain the disruption of these <pb xml:id="pg_713" n="713" facs="0745"/>communications is in itself a
                            form of escalation. In addition, while maintaining this interdiction
                            program, we would like to introduce variety by occasionally striking a
                            target on a random basis outside of the LOONC [<hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>
                            </hi>?] pattern, such as a power plant, military installation, dam site,
                            supply area, industrial complex. By so doing, we complicate the DRV
                            defense problem and make it clear that we are limited to no single
                            target plan. Thus, nothing other than populated areas is immune to
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>8. Under this concept, we would avoid the sensitive area of
                            Hanoi/Haiphong except for an occasional well selected target within the
                            area struck to show that we can penetrate and that there is no sure
                            sanctuary. We do not feel that an occasional selective intrusion into
                            this area is likely to invoke a Chinese reaction even though we tangle
                            with <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p>9. The number of industrial and other significant non-military targets
                            below the 20th parallel are few and far between. In fact there are very
                            few such targets outside of the Hanoi/Haiphong complex. We agree that
                            non-military targets should be struck as a variation from the LOC
                            pattern, but only occasionally and selectively, both North and South of
                            the 20th parallel.</p>
                        <p>10. In summary we recommend a basic pattern of <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> targets varied occasionally by other kinds of targets
                            both South and North of the 20th parallel to include the Hanoi/Haiphong
                            area. Upon this pattern, we would superimpose a program of full fledged
                            psywar operations as an integral part of Rolling Thunder. This would
                            require only a slight increase in air effort. Leaflet drops should
                            precede and sometimes accompany strikes, having the primary purpose of
                            explaining the cause and nature of Rolling Thunder and of magnifying
                            popular anxiety.</p>
                        <p>11. We appreciate this opportunity to present our views on these
                            important subjects.</p>

                                indicated that the problem of the two contested ministerial

                            outlined to us the outcome of today's long and generally fruitless
                            discussions aimed at restoring normalcy to the internal political
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>At 10 AM this morning, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> met
                            with most of the former members of the Armed Forces Council. He
                            explained to them the political situation and the constitutional impasse
                            reached between him and the Chief of State. According to one of the
                            military participants, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            asked for the General's support, but they withheld any commitment,
                            preferring to hear also the other side of the case from <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and the Legislative Council.</p>
                        <p>In order to broaden the discussion in conformance with the Generals'
                            request, at 14:30 <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, the Cabinet, the Generals, and
                            the Legislative Council all met at Gia Long Palace where they palavered
                            for most of the day. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            himself left the meeting at about 19:00 whereas some of the participants
                            were still hanging about two hours later.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> summarized the
                            accomplishments of the meetings as follows. It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> would put out an appeal to the
                            population in the name of the government, the Generals, and the
                            Legislative Council for the purpose of urging greater national unity in
                            these critical times. It is my understanding that this appeal has been
                            made by radio, although I have not yet been able to verify the fact.</p>
                        <p>Vice Premier <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> has
                            undertaken to settle the matter of the two reluctant ministers who do
                            not wish to resign. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> is
                            strangely vague as to what he expects <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> will do. However, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui
                                Diem</persName> seems sure that <persName corresp="#p_TUYEN1">Tuyen</persName> is basically on <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s side.</p>
                        <p>In view of the lack of enthusiasm of the Legislative Council to come to
                            grips with the constitutional issue, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> seems to consider it to have been satisfactorily
                            arranged to let this matter drag on unsettled.</p>
                        <p>In order to satisfy the Generals who were very vocal in criticizing the
                            civilians (and particularly but obliquely Suu) for their political
                            bickering <pb xml:id="pg_715" n="715" facs="0747"/>while the troops are
                            dying on the battlefield, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>
                            has undertaken to formulate a statement of stronger policy which will
                            guarantee a more energetic conduct of the war. He obviously did not know
                            what kind of specific measures he might propose: his vagueness suggests
                            that this will probably be more of a literary exercise than a change of
                            behavior.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> finished this summary of
                            the outcome of today's session, Bui Diem came in, having lingered behind
                            at Gia Long Palace. In response to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s question as to what had happened since <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s departure from the meeting,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui Diem</persName> announced that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> wanted a meeting at 15:00
                            tomorrow with the Prime Minister and General <persName corresp="#p_CHIEU1">Chieu</persName> of the Legislative Council to
                            discuss the current crisis. This surprised us as we assumed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s resume represented
                            the consensus of action required to meet the crisis. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> said that he thought <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> had primarily in mind discussing
                            the Catholic issue and the possibility that the military will return to
                            power if the civilians do not perform better. <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_Thi1">Thi</persName> in particular had become very
                            emotional over the ineffectiveness of the civilian government and had
                            left the meeting early in a rage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> and I then started asking questions
                            designed to bring out the unsatisfactory nature of the day's events. I
                            pointed out that there was a contradiction in striving for a stronger
                            policy and a more effective conduct of the war with a decision to stall
                            off a resolution of the constitutional powers of the Prime Minister. The
                            latter could hardly be expected to do better in the conduct of the war
                            with his powers clouded by the present controversy.</p>
                        <p>We asked why there had been no follow-up on the gambit started yesterday
                            when <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> wrote his letter to
                            the Chief of State, asking for agreement in the dismissal of the
                            Ministers of National Economy and Interior (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 4003). <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bui
                                Diem</persName> said that this partially completed action had been
                            overtaken by events, but when we pressed him, he conceded that there was
                            considerable merit in trying to carry it through as an easy, face-saving
                            way of resolving the constitutional issue.<note n="3" xml:id="d329fn3">According to a memorandum of a telephone conversation between
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in Saigon

                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> estimated at that point that the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government had only
                                a 50–50 chance of emerging from the constitutional crisis with its

                        <p>In spite of the general inconclusiveness of today's conferrings, there is
                            a new, important factor emerging in the form of the reappearance of the
                            Generals on the political scene. They appear to have shown themselves
                            genuinely reluctant to take sides in the Quat-Suu controversy, although
                            their sympathies seem to have been on the Prime Minister's side. One of
                            them has indicated that they would have declared for <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> had he <pb xml:id="pg_716" n="716" facs="0748"/>directly requested it, but no such request was
                            made. While being sharply critical of the civilian politicians, the
                            Generals limited themselves to offering to serve as arbitrators between

                            another of us has remarked that the British have been very solid and
                            helpful on Vietnam. And of course you have recollections, which the <pb xml:id="pg_717" n="717" facs="0749"/>rest of us only have at second
                            hand, of <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Harold Wilson</persName>'s effort to
                            telephone his way into a fancy trip to the White House at just the wrong
                                moment.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">See <ref target="#d103">Document
                                    103</ref>.</note> Moreover, you feel the wounds of what Home
                            said about busses and what <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Michael
                                Stewart</persName> said about gas, although everyone else has long
                            since forgotten those particular episodes.</p>
                        <p>It remains a fact that every experienced observer from <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName> on down has been
                            astonished by the overall strength and skill of
                                <persName>Wilson</persName>'s defense of our policy in Vietnam and
                            his mastery of his own left wing in the process. The support of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has been of real value
                            internationally—and perhaps of even more value in limiting the howls of
                            our own liberals. It is quite true, of course, that we would get this
                            kind of backing more or less automatically from a Conservative
                            government, but support from Labour is not only harder to get but
                            somewhat more valuable in international terms.</p>
                        <p>The only price we have paid for this support is the price of keeping them
                            reasonably well informed and fending off one ill-advised plan for
                            travel. This is not a very great cost. Moreover, we have had no leaks
                            from the British, and no public expression of worry about the length of
                            the pause. It is true that Gordon Walker has been making some moderately
                            foolish noises lately, but he is not a member of the government.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that it is well worth our while to keep the British on
                            board as long as it can be done simply by keeping them fully informed
                            and giving them the feeling that they are in the know as we go ahead. To
                            put it another way, I see no advantage at all in putting them at arms
                            length and thus increasing the risk that they will be tempted to
                                criticize.<note n="3" xml:id="d330fn3">On June 3 Prime Minister

                        <p>The President asked the Chancellor about the attitude of the German
                            people with regard to South Viet-Nam. Did they understand what was going
                            on there or was it for them just a faraway country?</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor replied that, although not everybody was concerned with
                            it, Viet-Nam was important to most Germans because they regarded it as a
                            kind of testing ground as to how firmly the US honors its commitments.
                            In that respect there existed a parallel between Saigon and Berlin. He
                            assured the President of his sympathies and understanding and stressed
                            that the Federal Republic would always work closely together with the US
                            and stand by it on these problems.</p>
                        <p>The President thanked the Chancellor for his understanding attitude. He
                            observed that the US had serious commitments under the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Pact and other treaties, and that
                            it would raise serious doubts in other parts of the world if the US did
                            not stand by its commitments in SE Asia. He told the Chancellor he could
                            go home and tell his people that the US would firmly stand by its
                            commitments.</p>

                        <p>Political Situation</p>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, the current unsettled political situation is a
                            reflection of the traditional divisive force at work in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> (particularly the religious and
                            regional clevages), the inexperience of the Vietnamese with practical
                            political processes, the frustrations of two decades of war without
                            victory in sight, and the predominant weight of the Saigon
                            “intellectuals” in the political equation. The <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> government did not create these
                            difficulties but rather is a victim of them. Quat and his associates
                            have failed as have past regimes to neutralize or balance the opposing
                            forces before they reached such proportions as to constitute a strong
                            challenge to his government. In the current confrontation <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s opposition is composed
                            primarily of the Sudistes, militant Catholic elements, and
                            out-politicians seeking to improve their lot in any change of
                            government. Fundamentally, the Sudistes and the militant Catholic
                            elements have been opposed to <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> from the date of his investiture but have lacked
                            the issues with which to mount a real confrontation. In seeking to
                            render his government more acceptable to the opposition elements,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> presented them with an
                            opportunity to organize and orchestrate a campaign to bring him down. In
                            this, they had enlisted the support of a pliable Chief of State and of
                            elements of the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects motivated primarily by
                            regional and political sentiments.</p>
                        <p>The role of Chief of State <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> has
                            been crucial and [in] the present confrontation he has provided both the
                            issue (in the interpretation of the provisional charter) and the means
                            to focus the political opposition. Suu's actions may well be motivated
                            by long-term political ambitions as well as the short-term political
                            considerations. He is strongly influenced by the Sudiste groups (Le Van
                            Thu, Hoang Ho, Tran Van Van, etc.) <pb xml:id="pg_720" n="720" facs="0752"/>responsible for his election as Chief of State. He is
                            undoubtedly being used by this group. The more readily since he foresees
                            for himself a more exalted and powerful role than that which he now
                            enjoys as Chief of State with nominal powers. These ambitions are
                            reflected in the projected draft constitution providing for a strong
                            Chief of State along de Gaulle lines, which <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> has announced that he wishes to submit for
                            referendum to the people, and by his call for early national elections.
                            In the immediate situation he has been a willing tool of the opposition
                            in raising constitutional and procedural questions in their
                            confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The position of the military has been to withdraw progressively from the
                            active political scene and to devote their efforts to fighting the war
                            and putting their own house in order. The military appeared content with
                            civilian rule so long as the government gave evidence that it could
                            effectively maintain a degree of political stability and direct the
                            affairs of state. Having withdrawn from the political scene under strong
                            urging from <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, the military
                            have been loath to intervene actively in the current crisis. They much
                            prefer to remain aloof in the current situation unless their
                            intervention is officially requested or should prove necessary as they
                            view the situation. However, the military leaders are upset and
                            increasingly impatient at the apparent inability of the civilian
                            elements to solve the current impasse. They desire above all a strong
                            effective government and if prospects for this appear dim, they will
                            undoubtedly move to assume power.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s performance
                            in the current crisis has not been reassuring. He has not projected an
                            image either as a forceful leader or as an astute politician. In
                            advancing his proposed cabinet reshuffle, he did not prepare the ground
                            either with the Chief of State, the <gloss target="#t_NLC1">NLC</gloss>,
                            or the ministers concerned. When faced with the “constitutional issue,”,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> did not seize the
                            initiative nor utilize his strong assets. Had he done so, at the outset
                            he could have forced the pace and probably achieved his objectives
                            before the opposition was strongly organized. His failure to act
                            decisively has fed the opposition and allowed them valuable time to
                            develop their campaign. His chief asset has been support from the
                            military. Quite understandably, he did not wish to inject the military
                            into the picture during the early stages of the confrontation; however,
                            he has not played this card effectively when events appeared to be
                            running against him. In short, when faced with his first real challenge,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> has been found to be
                            indecisive—an almost fatal posture in the arena of jugular-vein politics
                            in Saigon. Having said this, any realistic assessment must admit that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and his close
                            associates constitute perhaps the best group on the scene at present. No
                            single leader stands out as a clear alternative and no group exists
                            which shows promise of handling the affairs of state much better.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_721" n="721" facs="0753"/>
                        <p>Until late on 4 June, <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> faced
                            two general orders of problems: (1) the constitutional challenge posed
                            by Suu to his right to dismiss cabinet ministers, and (2) the vocal
                            opposition to his government articulated by the Catholics, Cao Dai, Hoa
                            Hao, and Sudiste politicians. Although the second order of problem was
                            brought to a focus by the [garble], the fact of public opposition
                            remains, even though the constitutional problem appears to be on the way
                            to settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of State has been asked to intercede with the religious groups
                            on <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>'s behalf, but it is not
                            yet clear whether he will in fact do so, or if he does, whether he will
                            pursue the task with energy and with the Prime Minister's interests in
                            mind. Nor is it clear how receptive the respective opposition groups
                            will be to his approaches and those of Quat. The Catholics, for example,
                            have up to the present given every evidence of implacable hostility to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName>, with indication that
                            this disaffection exists to a degree within the Catholic hierarchy
                            itself. The southern Catholics seem to be united with northern Catholics
                            on this issue.</p>
                        <p>In considering our own options, it will be important to determine the
                            depth and extent of the opposition to Quat now that the constitutional
                            deadlock has been broken and after soundings have been taken with these
                            groups by <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to determine whether their grievances
                            can be satisfied. In the interim period, our course of action should be
                            to urge on all sides (the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the
                            religions) the importance of arriving at an amicable accommodation. We
                            will also have to bear in mind the interests of such groups as the
                            United Buddhist Association, who will not be direct parties, to be sure
                            that they are not given a cause for grievance.</p>
                        <p>If such an accommodation—imperfect and vulnerable though it be—can be
                            reached, the immediate obstacle will have been surmounted and we can
                            perhaps look forward to this government surviving for some time more.
                            If, on the other hand, the opposing interests prove irreconcilable, or
                            the military situation continues seriously to deteriorate, we will have
                            to assess the situation in the light of the facts as they emerge and
                            consider various alternatives, of which a more active military
                            involvement in the political situation may be best from both political
                            and military points of view.</p>
                        <p>Military Situation</p>
                        <p>After a two-month relative lull, evidently spent in regrouping,
                            re-equipping and training, the Viet Cong have quickened the tempo of the
                            fighting. Since early May, main force units have returned to the
                            battlefield in increasing numbers, engaging in a number of attacks and
                            ambushes with forces up to regimental size. While the months of March
                            and April were relatively favorable for the government forces in terms
                            of casualty and weapons loss ratios, the trend in May became less
                            favorable as Viet Cong pressure mounted.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_722" n="722" facs="0754"/>
                        <p>Captured documents indicate the Viet Cong have embarked on a new military
                            campaign which will probably extend through the summer. Both Hanoi and
                            Liberation Front broadcasts have heralded this new campaign as a
                            demonstration of the Communists' will and determination to continue to
                            press the war despite increased U.S. involvement in both North and South
                            Vietnam. The apparent aims of this campaign are to alter the balance of
                            military forces in favor of the Viet Cong by inflicting maximum
                            attrition on the government forces, including specifically the piecemeal
                            destruction of regular ARVN ground combat units where possible, and to
                            extend Viet Cong control in rural areas by constricting <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces to the principal towns and
                            cities. The pattern of Viet Cong operations to date indicates the
                            campaign will be pressed vigorously in all military regions, the major
                            attacks and ambushes will be accompanied by intensified, small-scale
                            guerrilla activity, particularly sabotage and harassment of lines of
                            communication, and that the Viet Cong intend to consolidate their rural
                            gains through intensified subversion and political action. Increased
                            terrorist attacks against U.S. personnel and installations in urban
                            areas are also likely.</p>
                        <p>So far, the enemy has not employed his full capabilities in this
                            campaign. Only two of the nine Viet Cong regiments have been heavily
                            engaged (one in Phuoc Long and one in Quang Ngai), and probably only a
                            similar proportion of their separate battalions has been committed. In
                            most engagements, their main force units have displayed improved
                            training and discipline, heavier firepower, and a willingness to take
                            heavy losses if necessary to achieve their objectives. Their healthy
                            respect for the effectiveness of U.S. and GVN tactical air support is
                            reflected, however, in their reliance on ambush tactics instead of open
                            assaults.</p>
                        <p>In pressing their campaign, the Viet Cong are capable of mounting
                            regimental-size operations in all four <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Corps areas, and at least battalion-sized attacks in
                            virtually any province. The larger attacks can be supported by a limited
                            number of 70-mm or 75-mm artillery pieces. Known dispositions indicate
                            major actions are likely in the near future in the Binh Duong-Phuoc
                            Thanh-Phuoc Long area north of Saigon, in the Quang Ngai-Quang Tin area
                            in central Vietnam, and in Kontum Province. Major attacks could occur
                            also in other areas, since the Viet Cong have shown that they are
                            capable of concentrating in regimental strength without giving
                            significant warning.</p>
                        <p>While the Viet Cong remain numerically inferior in over-all strength,
                            they can achieve temporary local superiority at times and places of
                            their selection. Their ability to do this is facilitated by the
                            commitment of a large portion of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> infantry-type battalions to relatively static
                            missions, while the Viet Cong main force and local battalions are
                            employed only in an offensive role. During periods of intensive
                            activity, <pb xml:id="pg_723" n="723" facs="0755"/>the Viet Cong thus
                            enjoy the initiative in that they can choose the time, conditions, and
                            place of engagement; significant contacts rarely occur, even when RVNAF
                            units are engaged in aggressive operations, unless the Viet Cong elect
                            to engage. By posing simultaneous or successive threats in widely
                            separated areas, the Viet Cong have demonstated an ability to offset
                            [to] some extent <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>'s superior
                            transportation resources.</p>
                        <p>Despite severe losses on occasion, Viet Cong forces have shown a
                            remarkable recuperative ability. This has been facilitated by a
                            systematic recruiting effort and an evidently effective replacement
                            system, supplemented by the infiltration of northern draftees who have
                            been integrated into Viet Cong units in the northern provinces. Access
                            for recruiting purposes to the major portion of the population has
                            enabled the Viet Cong not only to replace their losses but to continue
                            to form new units. In addition to elements of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> 325th Division already identified in
                            the South, other units of this division and the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> 304th Division may already have entered or are
                            stationed in the Laos border area. These elements represent a
                            significant reinforcement capability for Viet Cong units in the I and II
                            Corps areas.</p>
                        <p>Although <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces generally have
                            responded well to the increased Viet Cong pressure, there have been
                            several disturbing instances of poor performance in critical situations.
                            Some units have broken under pressure and fled from the battlefield.
                            These manifestations, coupled with the continuing high desertion rate in
                            many units, reflect a generally marginal state of morale. The morale and
                            confidence of the Officer Corps were buoyed up by the more direct
                            involvement of U.S. forces since February. This improved spirit was
                            enhanced by the period of relative inactivity of the Viet Cong main
                            force units. The growing realization, however, that the increased U.S.
                            commitment would not produce an immediate end to the war, together with
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>'s apparent inability to cope
                            decisively as yet with the renewed Viet Cong offensive, apparently has
                            caused morale to sag again. Unless the anticipated Viet Cong major
                            attacks are effectively countered, morale will deteriorate further.
                            Indeed, the cumulative psychological impact of a series of significant
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> defeats could lead to a
                            collapse in ARVN's will to continue to fight, despite the presence in
                            South Vietnam of U.S. forces. To ward against the possibility of such a
                            collapse, it will probably be necessary to commit US ground forces to
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. The Communist leadership in Hanoi has not yet been shaken in its
                            determination to continue the war. It apparently has elected to respond
                            to the growing commitment of U.S. military resources in Vietnam by
                            employing their principal weapon—the Viet Cong ground force reinforced
                            by PAVN—in intensified operations in the South.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_724" n="724" facs="0756"/>
                        <p>2. Having resumed major offensive actions in South Vietnam, the enemy is
                            capable of continuing the recent pace of attacks and ambushes over the
                            next several months, although there will probably be local cyclical
                            fluctuations in the level activity. While the Viet Cong have suffered
                            heavy losses, they have generally achieved their objectives in actions
                            to date.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> general reserves have been
                            barely adequate to deal with any one major thrust and are inadequate to
                            counter simultaneous or successive thrusts in widely separated areas.
                            Taking advantage of terrain and weather conditions, the Viet Cong appear
                            likely to achieve further successes. To meet the shortage of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> reserves, it will probably be
                            necessary to commit U.S. ground forces to action.</p>
                        <p>4. Further military reverses, coupled with the economic disruption caused
                            by the harassment and blocking of lines of communication, will have a
                            serious adverse impact on popular confidence and morale, exacerbating
                            political instability in Sagion.</p>
                        <p>5. The political situation remains essentially unstable. Although the
                            constitutional impasse appears to have been resolved, the Quat
                            government continues to be faced with the difficult task of reaching an
                            accommodation with strong opposition groups seeking its ouster and its
                            life line is of uncertain length. The military and political situations
                            are closely interrelated, and reverses in either area will have an
                            adverse reaction in the other.</p>

                            pressure by air attacks as well as by efforts in the South. They would
                            avoid the Hanoi-Haiphong area except for an occasional selected
                            target—and they believe a little more than we do that pain in the North
                            will help bring a change of heart in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>2. I share Bob McNamara's view that we can readily frame a specific
                            program over the next month that will be acceptable to the Embassy
                            without unacceptable risks of escalation. I myself am more attracted
                            than <persName>Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> by the notion of an occasional limited attack
                            inside the Hanoi perimeter—probably in the Haiphong port area.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to Thursday's Leadership meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">See <ref target="#d326">Document 326</ref>.</note> I want to stress
                            my support for your resistance to pressures for an irreversible
                            extension of the war in Asia. That is what the bombing of Hanoi-Haiphong
                            could well amount to. I say that because the bombing would be more than
                            just another military measure. It would also be a political act of the
                            first magnitude.</p>
                        <p>In keeping the lid on these pressures you are on sound historic and
                            realistic grounds in terms of the vital interests of the United States.
                            The word “vital” is used most advisedly because the following is what I
                            believe would result from the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.</p>
                        <p>1. The bombing is likely to have no significant value to us in the
                            military situation because the Communists in Hanoi and Peking have long
                            expected it and have undoubtedly made their plans accordingly.</p>
                        <p>2. The bombing is likely to forestall indefinitely any prospects of
                            discussions with the other side, unconditional or otherwise.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_726" n="726" facs="0758"/>
                        <p>3. The bombing is likely to provide another world-wide impetus to nations
                            to disassociate themselves from the American position and, in Asia, this
                            separation could begin to extend to Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. The bombing is likely to insure the irreversibility of the Chinese
                            involvement and will act to seal Chinese domination over North Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>5. The bombing is likely to freeze Russia into the role, at least, of
                            principal outside supplier of military equipment for North Viet Nam and
                            China.</p>
                        <p>6. The bombing is likely to bring about an enlargement and acceleration
                            of the ground war in South Viet Nam and, hence, it will compel the rapid
                            injection of more American forces on the ground, even to hold the
                            situation in that region.</p>
                        <p>7. The bombing is likely to insure that the war eventually will have to
                            be carried, in the search for decision, into North Viet Nam, into other
                            parts of Southeast Asia, and probably into China itself. And who is
                            going to carry the main burden of this extension if not United States
                            ground forces? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> spoke of 300,000 Americans to deal with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GIAP1">Giap</persName>'s forces if they came
                            south. That is but a beginning. If the expansion goes on to include
                            combat with Chinese forces all over Southeast Asia, we had better start
                            thinking in terms of millions.</p>
                        <p>These consequences of a bombing of Hanoi-Haiphong would do violence to
                            the vital interests of the United States. For, at the end of the line,
                            even if there is something which could be called a victory, we would be
                            faced with a cost of an occupation and reconstruction in Asia which
                            would dwarf anything which has yet been seen.</p>
                        <p>Getting in deep on the Asian mainland is a course which has been rejected
                            repeatedly throughout our history and most emphatically by <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> at the other
                            extremity of Asia. As President, the choice was his to make in Korea. He
                            could have pushed the air-war in the search for a clear-cut decision. He
                            chose, instead, to negotiate a cease-fire in Korea, rather than to
                            proceed to deepen the involvement by bombing beyond the Yalu. On the
                            basis of that cease-fire in Korea, we held what was, in fact, already
                            held on the ground and yielded to them what they already held on the
                            ground.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that our side does not have much on the ground, even in South
                            Viet Nam. But if we are determined to hold that entire region on our
                            terms, it is going to have to be in South Viet Nam and not in the air
                            over North Viet Nam that the ground has to be won. Indeed, the bombing
                            of the North, after the initial sallies, appears to have made the
                            military task in the South more difficult and costly. Certainly, it is
                            related to the rapid expansion of our own ground forces in the South.
                            And it would be my judgment that if we bomb Hanoi-Haiphong it will serve
                            to raise the ante to us on the ground in South Viet Nam once again.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_727" n="727" facs="0759"/>
                        <p>I think it is about time you got an accounting from those who have
                            pressured you in the past to embark on this course and continue to
                            pressure you to stay on it. It is time to ask, not only what immediate
                            advantages it has in a narrow military sense, but where does it lead in
                            the end: What was promised by the initial extension of the war in the
                            air over the North? And what, in fact, has it produced to date?</p>
                        <p>As I see it, and you know it is a view which I have long held, there are
                            no significant American interests which dictate an essentially massive,
                            unilateral American military effort to control the flow of events in
                            Viet Nam or even on the Southeast Asian mainland as a whole. There is,
                            on the contrary, only a general interest, shared with many other
                            outsiders, in the stability, peace and progress of the region. That is
                            not the kind of interest which we can serve by overwhelming the region
                            with either our military strength or our substance. It is the kind of
                            interest which requires us to do a share, along with the other outsiders
                            whose tangible, political and economic and commercial stake in the
                            region is in some cases much larger than our own. It is the kind of
                            interest which, it would seem to me, calls for the minimum military
                            effort which is necessary to hold the situation in the South from
                            falling apart altogether and a maximum initiative on our part to get
                            this whole sorry business to a conference table as soon as
                                possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3">

                                agreed with him on the importance of limiting the bombing campaign

                                Vietnam, and did not feel that an effective cease-fire would be as

                        <p>Meanwhile, the French have reported the approach to the British, who in

                        <p>More basically, Hanoi propaganda is now going all out to play up the four
                            points, while Peking has flatly stated their acceptance is a

                            more than ever sure in retrospect that Hanoi was playing just for the
                            French gloss they appear to be getting, while not in fact committing
                            itself, and of course denouncing the pause in their public

                        <p>This took place on May 31, and was obviously meant to be conveyed to us.
                            I told the British yesterday they could tell Chen Yi we had received the
                            message. Hopson is seeing Chen Yi again soon.</p>
                        <p>On substance, Tab B is Lindsey Grant's analysis,<note n="11" xml:id="d335fn11">Dated June 3.</note> with which I agree. Chen Yi
                            was apparently being (a) tough about <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            resolve; (b) mild in the sense that he appeared to be saying China would
                            not come in unless China itself were attacked; (c) tough as to China
                            going all the way if it did come in.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most interesting thing is that Peiping was so forthcoming to
                            Hopson on his first call. While the substance was nothing new, the
                            repetition of a specific message, allegedly sent once through <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Ayub</persName> though not clearly conveyed to us
                            through that channel, plus the length of the discussion, does indicate
                            Peiping wants a channel and has perhaps chosen this one at least for the
                            time being.</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of the Chen Yi approach is confined to the UKG and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> among allies. It was held very close
                            when first received but [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text
                                not declassified</hi>]. Thus, it is more widely known within the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> than it should be, but I hope we
                            do not have a leak problem.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, Hanoi is blasting away at the Indian proposal almost daily,
                            usually pairing this with its play-up of the four points (The Bo message
                            also contained a more measured rejection, with reasons.) The purpose is
                            obviously to move the Algiers nations to adopt the four points.</p>

                            (b) and (c) would have particular appeal to the world, since Pham Van
                            Dong's four points would simply put the Liberation Front in at once
                            without elections, and the fourth point on reunification likewise makes
                            no reference to elections.</p>

                            thoughts. However, if the Ambassador comes back over the weekend, we
                            probably want to await his return. Moreover, we have the imponderable

                            they will be in a bad way at Algiers if we do not have a summary
                            statement by the middle of the month, to compete with the four

                            which repeats publicly that he will allow any <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> representation the great powers agree on, but is also
                            remarkably frank that he would be swallowed by China if it got power in
                            the area. (We have sent this out to posts, particularly for New Delhi
                            use, in their soft approach to Nong Kimny.) The letter has an air of
                            genuineness, almost of despair; maybe he is now hoping for mercy from
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, but he could be extending a

                        <p>One interesting feature of Hanoi's latest propaganda<note n="17" xml:id="d335fn17">Not further identified.</note> is that it groups
                            the four points with the Liberation Front statement of March 22 (which
                            is harder on its face). This could be an attempt to build up the Front
                            more—again with an eye to Algiers. One of the shoes that could drop at

                            they might be waiting to capture a provincial capital to do this (Pleiku

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName> said that he is persuaded
                            from his conversations with diplomats and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> officials that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is
                            not now interested in any negotiations. He said that he was able to see

                            that discussion had revealed nothing new. Trinh followed standard line
                            that US offer of unconditional discussions was “deceitful” since US
                            continued build-up in South Vietnam and bombing of North. Seaborn
                            pressed <persName corresp="#p_Trinh1">Trinh</persName> to elaborate on
                            “four points,” asking whether points intended to be seen as

                            vague and gave no clear answers. <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName> pressed specifically on point about withdrawal
                            of US troops, but also only received vague and indefinite reply.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJB1">Seaborn</persName> said his discussion with

                        </p>
                        <p>1. As indicated Ref A, a broad review of force requirements has been
                            conducted in light of the changing situation in Southeast Asia and
                            within <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. There are indications that the conflict in Southeast Asia is in the
                            process of moving to a higher level. Some <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces have entered <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and more may well be on the way. Additional jet
                            fighters and some jet light bombers have been deployed in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Specifically, elements of the 325th <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> division are in the northern zone of II Corps. It is
                            quite possible that the major portion, if not all of the division is now
                            deployed in the Kontum, Pleiku, Phu Bon area. Elements of the 304th
                                <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> division are suspected to be
                            in the panhandle and, therefore, capable of following the 325th. The
                            recent heavy actions in Phuoc Long and Quang Ngai, and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> initiatives in Pleiku, Kontum, Phu Bon
                            and Thua Thien are demonstrations of VC strength and their apparent
                            determination to employ their forces aggressively. Recent events as well
                            as captured <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prisoners and documents
                            suggest that a summer campaign is now underway to destroy government
                            forces and concurrently, to first isolate and then attack district and
                            province towns.</p>
                        <p>4. So far the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have not employed their
                            full capabilities in this campaign. Only two of the nine Viet Cong
                            regiments have been heavily engaged (one in Phuoc Long and one in Quang
                            Ngai), and probably only a similar proportion of their separate
                            battalions has been committed. In most engagements, <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> main force units have displayed improved
                            training and discipline, heavier firepower from the new family of
                            weapons with which most main force units have been equipped, and a
                            willingness to take heavy losses in order to achieve objectives.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_734" n="734" facs="0766"/>
                        <p>5. In pressing their campaign, the Viet Cong are capable of mounting
                            regimental-size operations in all four <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Corps areas, and at least battalion-sized attacks in
                            virtually all provinces. Known dispositions indicate major actions are
                            likely in the near future in the Binh Duong-Phuoc Thanh-Phuoc Long area
                            north of Saigon, in the Quang Ngai-Quang Tin area in Central Vietnam,
                            and in Kontum, Pleiku, Phu Bon and Binh Dinh Provinces. Major attacks
                            could occur also in other areas; the Viet Cong have shown that they are
                            capable of concentrating in regimental strength with little or no
                            warning. Whether or not the 304th Div is in, or moving toward <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has a “doorstep” capability to reinforce the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with sizable forces.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces on the other hand are
                            already experiencing difficulty in coping with this increased <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capability. Desertion rates are
                            inordinately high. Battle losses have been higher than expected; in
                            fact, four <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions have been
                            rendered ineffective by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> action in the
                            I and II Corps zones. Therefore, effective fighting strength of many
                            infantry and ranger battalions is unacceptably low. As a result, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops are beginning to show signs of
                            reluctance to assume the offensive and in some cases their steadfastness
                            under fire is coming into doubt. In order to bring existing battalions
                            up to acceptable battlefield strength, it will be necessary to declare
                            at least a temporary moratorium on the activation of new battalions.
                            Thus, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> force ratios upon which we based our
                            estimate of the situation in March have taken an adverse trend. You will
                            recall that I recommended the deployment of a U.S. division in II Corps
                            to cover the period of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            buildup and to weigh the force ratios in that important area. We assumed
                            at that time that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions
                            would be brought to full strength by now and that the force buildup
                            would proceed on schedule. Neither of these assumptions has
                            materialized.</p>
                        <p>7. The problem of low battlefield strength in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has forced us to plan the use of personnel now
                            training in 11 new battalions as fillers for old battalions. In effect,
                            these 11 battalions will be deferred and during the period from mid-July
                            to early November no new <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            battalions will become available. Thus the gap to be filled is both
                            deeper and wider.</p>
                        <p>8. In summary, the force ratios continue to change in favor of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. I believe that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will commit whatever forces it deems
                            necessary to tip the balance and that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot stand up successfully to this kind of pressure
                            without reinforcement. Even if <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> intentions are debatable, their
                            capabilities must be acknowledged and faced. Additionally, it is prudent
                            to consider possible enemy air action, leading to <pb xml:id="pg_735" n="735" facs="0767"/>significant escalation and a broadening of the
                            arena of conflict. We must be prepared to face such a contingency.<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">In telegram 2873 to Saigon, June 11, the
                                Department of State noted that <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>
                                and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had assessed the military
                                appraisal of the situation in South Vietnam provided in telegram
                                19118. While agreeing that it was serious, the intelligence analysts
                                questioned the implication that there was a serious danger of
                                complete military collapse within a relatively short period of time.
                                This impression, the Department noted, was not supported by
                                reporting from Saigon, and telegram 19118 did not reinforce the
                                impression with reference to a dramatic or unexpected development in
                                the military situation. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. In order to cope with the situation outlined above, I see no course of
                            action open to us except to reinforce our efforts in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> with additional U.S. or third country
                            forces as rapidly as is practical during the critical weeks ahead.
                            Additionally, studies must continue and plans developed to deploy even
                            greater forces, if and when required, to attain our objectives or
                            counter enemy initiatives. Ground forces deployed to selected areas
                            along the coast and inland will be used both offensively and
                            defensively. U.S. ground troops are gaining experience and thus far have
                            performed well. Although they have not yet engaged the enemy in
                            strength, I am convinced that U.S. troops with their energy, mobility,
                            and firepower can successfully take the fight to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. The basic purpose of the additional
                            deployments recommended below is to give us a substantial and hard
                            hitting offensive capability on the ground to convince the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> that they cannot win.</p>
                        <p>10. In sub-paragraph “A” below, deployments and actions are recommended
                            on which decisions should be made now. In subpara “B” we have identified
                            further actions on which planning should start and on which separate
                            recommendations will be forthcoming:</p>
                        <p>A. Actions recommended:</p>
                        <p>(1) Deploy at once to I <gloss target="#t_CTZ1">CTZ</gloss> the remaining
                            two BLTs of the 3d Mar Div and appropriate supporting division and air
                            elements (approximately 8,000 personnel). Reconstitute the <gloss target="#t_SLF1">SLF</gloss> as a floating reserve.</p>
                        <p>(2) Deploy balance of increment 1 and all of increment 2 (as defined in
                            Ref C) of army logistic and other support units in accordance with
                            schedule set out in Ref D. (Approximately 8,000 personnel.)</p>
                        <p>(3) Deploy the US Army Air Mobile Division (and logistic increment 3)
                            through Qui Nhon to An Ke, Pleiku and Kontum (approximately 21,000
                            personnel). Qui Nhon will be ready to receive the division approximately
                            1 August, upon the closure of increment 2 forces.</p>
                        <p>(4) Concurrently with the Air Mobile Division, deploy I Corps
                            Headquarters (approximately 1,500 personnel).</p>
                        <p>(5) Deploy the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Marine <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> to Cam Ranh Bay as soon after 1 July as
                            the unit can be readied for movement (approximately 4,000 personnel).
                            Deploy balance of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Division force
                            (approximately 14,500 personnel) plus US logistic increment 4 (1,500
                            personnel), starting 15 September to the general area of Qui Nhon. (This
                            answers Ref E in part—separate message on F86F will follow.)<note n="4" xml:id="d337fn4">Not found.</note>

                        <p>(6) Deploy additional tactical fighter squadrons to Cam Ranh Bay when
                            expeditionary landing field complete at that location. Also provide
                            naval aircraft carrier support of in-country operations as required; we
                            believe this latter will engage one carrier full time.</p>
                        <p>(7) Hold the 173d Airborne Brigade in-country until the Air Mobile
                            Division has deployed and is ready for operations.</p>
                        <p>(8) Continue air attacks against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.
                            (Ref F applies.)</p>
                        <p>B. Additional deployment that may be required and on which planning
                            should begin:</p>
                        <p>(1) Three U.S. Army Hawk battalions to TN Bien Hoa, Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh
                            in that priority.</p>
                        <p>(2) The remainder of the 1st Infantry Division or the 101st Airborne
                            Division begining 1 October.</p>
                        <p>(3) One additional <gloss target="#t_MAB1">MAB</gloss> to reinforce the
                            III <gloss target="#t_MAF1">MAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(4) Tactical air units for support of increased U.S. force (additional
                            airfields in SVN and Thailand may be required).</p>
                        <p>(5) Required combat and logistic support forces to include helicopter
                            units to support the foregoing.</p>
                        <p>11. Message has been discussed with Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and

                                He expressed apprehension, however, over the proposed deployment of
                                the U.S. Air Mobile Division to the central highlands. <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> argued that limited U.S.
                                combat forces should be used to secure the more populous coastal

                        <p>With regard to the first subject, when I left Washington following the

                            Instead, it would be retained on the coast for reaction employment
                            elsewhere within the country. The third proposal was Secretary

                            add to the present approved deployments a total of five battalions, two

                            the remainder was a brigade of three Army battalions to be located on

                            (already approved) totalling 18,000 men, thus raising our overall
                            strength to about 70,000. The four battalions were assumed to be a
                            brigade of three to Qui Nhon and a fourth battalion to the Saigon area
                            to raise the strength of the Army troops there from two to three

                        <p>On June 8, 1965, Department of State Spokesman <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">Robert J. McCloskey</persName> acknowledged, in
                            response to questions from reporters, that U.S. forces in South Vietnam
                            “would be available for combat support together with the Vietnamese
                            forces as and when necessary.” (The Washington Post, June 10, 1965)
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McCloskey</persName>'s statement
                            followed a joint State-Defense message to Saigon, June 5, which
                            reconfirmed General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s authority to commit U.S. ground forces to
                            combat support operations:</p>

                        <p>On June 9 <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> ran a lead story,
                            based upon <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McCloskey</persName>'s
                            statement, which observed that a new phase in the Vietnamese war had
                            been signaled with the announcement that United States ground forces
                            could be used in a combat role in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The White House issued a statement on June 9 that indicated that there
                            had been no change in the mission of United States ground combat units
                            in Vietnam:</p>
                        <p>“The primary mission of these troops is to secure and safeguard important
                            military installations like the air base at Danang. They have the
                            associated mission of active patrolling and securing action in and near
                            the areas thus safeguarded. If help is requested by appropriate
                            Vietnamese commanders, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> also has authority within the assigned
                            mission to employ these troops in support of Vietnamese forces faced
                            with aggressive attack when other effective reserves are not available
                            and when, in his judgement, the general military situation urgently
                            requires it.” (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                        <p>The text of the statement was conveyed to Saigon in circular telegram
                            2470, June 9.

                        <p>1. This meeting which ran from 1300 to 1430, with the President joining
                            it at 1330, consisted of a rather wide-ranging discussion of the
                            Vietnamese problem. No decisions were made, it being agreed that Mr.
                            Bundy would convene a meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> on Wednesday afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">June 9.</note> to prepare points for decision which
                            could be raised with the President at a session to be held on Thursday
                                morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d340fn3">See <ref target="#d343">Document 343</ref>.</note> This procedure may, of course, be
                            changed, but this was what was forecast as of 1430, 8 June.</p>
                        <p>2. There was considerable discussion of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s recommendations for
                            United States military increases contained in telegram <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>-19118 of 7 June.<note n="4" xml:id="d340fn4">
                                <ref target="#d337">Document 337</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> informed the President that
                            if these recommended increases were put into effect, it would raise the
                            total of United States forces in Vietnam to 151,000. This figure is made
                            up of 70,000 in place by the end of August, plus 46,000 more requested
                            in the <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> telegram,
                            plus 35,000 recommended for later decision. This total figure would go
                            up to 170,000 if Korean, Australian, and other national units were
                            included. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            explained that the Westmoreland telegram grew out of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s concern over the poor fighting
                            performance of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in recent
                            battles and fear that a break-down of fighting morale might occur among
                            the South Vietnamese. He pointed out that the principal failure was on
                            the part of the Second Division and that steps had already been taken to
                            relieve its commander. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> also noted that desertions in the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> were of such a rate that between
                            mid-February and mid-May there had been a net gain of only 11,000 in
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> total strength. In other <pb xml:id="pg_740" n="740" facs="0772"/>words, desertions were
                            off-setting recruitments to a degree which had not been accurately
                            forecast. (There seemed to be some disagreement between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> over the monthly rate of
                            desertions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> using
                            the figure of 10,000 and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            using the figure of from 3,000 to 4,000.) By the end of the meeting, it
                            seemed to be reasonably agreed that the logistics of the situation were
                            such that only a certain number of American troops could be introduced
                            into South Vietnam prior to September and that this in and of itself
                            would tend to defer and to limit the basic decision as the whether the
                            strength of American forces should be allowed to climb to any figure
                            like 150,000. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was
                            advocating what he referred to as a “limited cost and limited risk”
                            option, and this turns out to be almost identical with what the
                            logistics will in any event permit.</p>
                        <p>3. The Department of State representatives asked at what point in a
                            build-up of United States forces does this war become a “white man's
                            war”. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> replied
                            that he did not know and that it was for this reason that he preferred a
                            slow, “incremental” build-up. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out
                            that a progressive build-up might develop to a size that was
                            unacceptable, at which point the President discussed the problems we
                            will have with the Congress and with our allies as we add substantial
                            numbers of troops.</p>
                        <p>4. On the political side, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> discussed the current squabble between <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and indicated that he could well do without
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> right now. He said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suu1">Suu</persName> was constantly welshing
                            on agreements, that he had no particular attributes or political base.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> indicated that if
                            the present government were to fall, the next one would doubtless be a
                            military dictatorship.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> received approval
                            for Rolling Thunder XVIII. One question was raised as to whether this
                            should include Target 43 or Target 28. It was decided to go for Target
                            28. Otherwise, there was no disagreement on targets.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName>Rusk</persName> asked if there was any evidence of
                            substantial military movements in either Communist China or North Korea.
                            I answered in the negative. (I have asked Mr. Jack Smith to report
                            regularly on this query.)</p>
                        <p>7. The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, upon his return to Saigon, to get the South
                            Vietnam Government “on the record” as being opposed to any negotiation
                            between it and the Viet Cong. In response to a question as to what the
                            bombing in the North has achieved aside from giving the South Vietnamese
                            Government some stability for the last ninety days, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that there has
                            been a sizable military benefit in the form of the difficulties which
                            the North Vietnamese have had in moving men and supplies into the South.
                            He said he was convinced that it had thrown a distinct block into the
                            time-table of Viet Cong attacks.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_741" n="741" facs="0773"/>
                        <p>8. The President asked that all options be reviewed, that our objectives
                            in Vietnam be specified, and that recommendations be made later in the
                            week as to how we should proceed with the Vietnamese war.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to our telephone conversation last night,<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">The President telephoned Mansfield at 5:05 p.m. on

                            here are some additional thoughts.</p>
                        <p>The formal delegation of authority to <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> to commit American combat troops comes at a
                            time when the last semblance of constituted government (the <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> group) in Saigon is disappearing.
                            As I understand it, Westmoreland will respond to requests from the
                            Vietnamese military not the Vietnamese government. This underscores the
                            fact that there is not a government to speak of in Saigon. In short we
                            are now at the point where we are no longer dealing with anyone who
                            represents anybody in a political sense. We are simply acting to prevent
                            a collapse of the Vietnamese military forces which we pay for and supply
                            in any event and who presumably are going in the same direction we are
                            going. That reality is not going to be lost on any government—friend or
                            foe—anywhere in the world.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_742" n="742" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>It raises again the question, and it is a crucial one: In what direction
                            are we going in Viet Nam? We can talk of negotiations, conferences and
                            peace. We can talk of the independence and welfare of the people of
                            South Viet Nam. We can talk of unconditional discussions. But the
                            question is going to be asked increasingly: What do we mean when we say
                            we are going to stay in South Viet Nam and for what specific United
                            States or Vietnamese ends are we going to stay there? The question will
                            be asked increasingly at home no less than abroad.</p>
                        <p>And it is the crucial question because the answer to it should control
                            the extent and nature of our military involvement in Viet Nam. As I see
                            it, at this point, we can mean one of three things when we say we are
                            going to stay in South Viet Nam. I am no military expert but, on the
                            basis of our past experience elsewhere and developments in Viet Nam
                            since the first of the year, it seems to me that the military costs of
                            each of these three alternatives would look something like this:</p>
                        <p>1. Do we mean that we are going to stay in Viet Nam until we or our
                            Vietnamese military allies prevail everywhere south of the 17th parallel
                            down to the smallest hamlet? If that is what we mean, we are talking in
                            terms of years or decades, and upwards of a million American soldiers on
                            the ground in South Viet Nam, assuming that the Chinese do not become
                            involved with men.</p>
                        <p>2. Or are we talking about holding the military situation about where it
                            is now? So far as I can judge, from second hand reports, this would mean
                            that our side must retain the provincial capitals, the larger towns in
                            the interior, Saigon, and the coastal cities and we must be able to
                            maintain at least tenuous lines of communication on the ground in
                            between. If that is what we are talking about when we say we are going
                            to stay in Viet Nam, then the 300,000 <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> estimate is probably too low but something in
                            the range of 500,000 might do it, at least if <persName corresp="#p_GIAP1">Giap</persName>'s army does not move in full and
                            open force across the 17th parallel.</p>
                        <p>3. Or are we talking about staying in Viet Nam in order to hold a
                            bargaining position for negotiations which might be expected to permit
                            some reasonable choice—self-determination—on the part of the South
                            Vietnamese people as to their political future, some protection for
                            Vietnamese who have been on our side and some prospect of a bona fide
                            peace based on eventual withdrawal of all foreign forces. If that is
                            what we are talking about, then it would appear to me that instead of
                            committing United States combat forces to the difficult-to-defend
                            Vietnamese outpost cities and towns scattered in the interior, we ought
                            to be drawing the Vietnamese garrisons in those towns into the coastal
                            bases and into Saigon where they would add to our strength, rather than
                            the reverse. And at the same time, we should stop waiting for signals
                            but rather launch a powerful diplomatic peace-offensive to try to get to
                            a conference table. Unless the situation is already totally hopeless,
                            this kind of <pb xml:id="pg_743" n="743" facs="0775"/>holding of South
                            Viet Nam may be feasible—at least for a year or so with something on the
                            order of 100,000 or less United States combat forces on the ground
                            backed by powerful naval and air units.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if a sustained peace offensive, simultaneously, succeeds in
                            bringing about a conference during the next six months, new elements
                            will inevitably be introduced into the situation and it is conceivable
                            that they could begin to point the way to a resolution of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The absence of a decision as to which of the above approaches really
                            serves our national interests, seems to me to be the crux of the
                            difficulty which has confronted us all along. I think you know my
                            personal view as to which course is preferable in the national interest.
                            But as things are now going, it is apparent that you are being advised
                            to continue to take at least the second course. The rate of commitment
                            is accelerating and it is quite likely that it will lead rapidly to
                            pressure to follow the first course, if not to go beyond it to all-out
                            war with China. That may not be the way it looks now but a course once
                            set in motion, as you know, often develops its own momentum and
                            rationale whatever the initial intentions.</p>
                        <p>As for the question of Taylor's replacement, as I told you, Lodge's name
                            may set off an immediate and hostile debate of the whole situation in
                            the Senate. You have got <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                                Johnson</persName> out there already. He has played a major role and
                            has had a major responsibility in this situation for years. It would
                            seem to me that if we are going to continue on the course of getting in
                            deeper he is the logical man to continue with it.</p>
                        <p>With respect to another Congressional resolution on the situation, I
                            cannot see the value of it at this point whether it originates here or
                            with you. The Senate cannot direct you in the conduct of foreign
                            relations even if it wanted to and I think you know that there is no
                            substantial group in the Senate which is going to take the initiative in
                            urging you to put more American ground forces into South Viet Nam. I
                            think you know too, that what has been done to date in the way of
                            resolutions, however one-sided the votes, has been done with grave
                            doubts and much trepidation on the part of many Senators. It has been
                            done largely on faith, out of loyalty to you and on the basis of the
                            general view that when the President has the responsibility and when he
                            requests legislative support in a crisis, he should have it.</p>
                        <p>But if you make another request, at this time, in connection specifically
                            with the use of ground forces, I am concerned at the possible reaction.
                            It is not nearly as predictable as in the past when the requests have
                            been for support of policy in general terms or for funds. A request at
                            this time could set off a wave of criticism and of demands for inquiries
                            which, in the end, even though a resolution were overwhelmingly
                            approved, <pb xml:id="pg_744" n="744" facs="0776"/>would not in any way
                            strengthen your hand, render your task easier or make your burden of
                            responsibility lighter.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">

                            from Secretary. We are considering here proposal to knock out IL-28's
                            and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites nearest completion through
                            major single air strike including use of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> B-52's. We would like your personal reaction, in
                            consultation with Westmoreland only, if he is available, concerning such
                            a course of action.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence community estimates that such attack would cause <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to believe future attacks on urban
                            centers much more likely and that general US actions might be stepped
                            up. However, conclusion is that Hanoi would accept punishment as long as
                            it believes it is winning in SVN and would not be led to make
                            conciliatory gestures. Retaliatory <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            raids and even possibly air strikes would be considered by Hanoi, but
                            intelligence community does not believe <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would react by overt invasion of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> although it might step up <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> support and increase <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> line units in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Estimate is that ChiComs would furnish additional support, which <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would probably request, including
                            additional fighter aircraft. Majority believe ChiComs would not engage
                            in air combat over DRV from ChiCom bases but minority thinks this
                            probable. Sovs would be put on major spot but would probably react
                            initially by replacing most of destroyed equipment, though perhaps not
                                <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>'s themselves at once. Sovs
                            would probably reach general conclusion they had little choice but to
                            increase aid to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, intelligence community estimates that not attacking these
                            targets might lead to Communist conclusion US, at least for time being,
                            has accepted certain limitations and ground rules in bombing of <pb xml:id="pg_745" n="745" facs="0777"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Sovs might take somewhat more rigid
                            position though still hoping for negotiated settlement and Hanoi might
                            conclude it could press war in South at no greater risk to key <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> areas. Intelligence community does not
                            believe Sovs would necessarily increase build-up of offensive weapons,
                            although they might do so. Also conclude that it is unlikely <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> now intends to use <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>'s in offensive operations with or
                            without attack, although special circumstances might arise or Hanoi
                            might conceivably try an individual raid with them.</p>

                                to the Secretary. Johnson noted that he considered the <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s to be differing problems, in that the bomber was
                                an offensive weapon and the missiles had a strictly defensive
                                capability. On balance, taking into account the danger of involving
                                Chinese forces in the conflict, Johnson concluded that the purpose
                                of demonstrating U.S. resolve without broadening the war could be
                                achieved by limited, selective attacks on <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> missile sites. He noted that Westmoreland concurred
                                in this recommendation. <persName>Johnson</persName> added: “This is
                                going to be a long war and there are no shortcuts yet in sight. We
                                should not let our natural frustrations and impatience mislead us
                                into ill considered efforts to find shortcuts.” (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. We take US objectives in Vietnam to be the reduction of Viet Cong
                            insurgency to manageable levels and, as part of this, forcing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease promoting that insurgency.
                            More specific and limited objectives are dealt with in the following
                            discussion of the particular options which appear to be open to the US

                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option A</p>
                        <p>2. Course of Action: To continue with essentially our present course and
                            objectives: that is, to bomb selected targets in the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (but not population centers, economic
                            targets, <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites, and jet-capable
                            airfields in the Hanoi-Haiphong area), and to build up US combat
                            strength considerably in the South.</p>
                        <p>3. Objectives: To give the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> sufficient stiffening support to
                            permit the reduction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            insurrection to manageable proportions; to lessen the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> supporting increment to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength; and to cause <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            leadership to cease or to tamp down the war, at least for some time.</p>
                        <p>4. Consequences: In our view, this will probably not permit us to impose
                            our will on the enemy. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would
                            continue to reinforce the <pb xml:id="pg_750" n="750" facs="0782"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and we doubt that US/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces could soon produce any
                            decisive improvement in the military situation. The most likely results
                            would be heavy US casualties, an over-emphasis on the military aspects
                            of the conflict to the detriment of the political, and bogging-down of
                            the war at higher levels of commitment and intensity, and, perhaps
                            ultimately, a petering out of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> determination and intensity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option B</p>
                        <p>5. Course of Action: To continue to increase US forces to the extent
                            necessary to defeat the Viet Cong, to increase sharply our weight of
                            attack on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, bombing virtually all
                            targets; to impose a naval quarantine; to accept further difficulties
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the possibility of
                            major hostilities with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>6. Objectives: Raised from those of a<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">Reference in the source text is unclear.</note> above, to compel
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease and desist in the
                            South; to coerce Communist China into acquiescing in such a DRV decision
                            lest it incur attacks on its own territory, perhaps including
                            destruction of its nascent advanced weapons capability.</p>
                        <p>7. Consequences: This would risk convincing the Communists that the US
                            intended to destroy the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regime and
                            thus bring us close to the “flash-point” of Chinese Communist
                            intervention. If they judged that the Hanoi regime was losing control of
                            the country, they would probably enter the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> unilaterally and might engage US air forces with their
                            own.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option C</p>
                        <p>8. Course of Action: To cease bombing in the North, to hold on in the
                            South, and to seek to negotiate as good a Vietnam settlement as we can
                            get.</p>
                        <p>9. Objectives: To settle for a Laos-type “neutralist” solution—guaranteed
                            by other powers and by a continuing, but markedly lessened, US presence
                            in South Vietnam—on the grounds that we cannot, at an acceptable cost,
                            “win” militarily or impose our will on Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>10. Consequences: US overtures for negotiation would probably be rejected
                            and, the enemy, scenting a weakening in US determination, would probably
                            fight on, while raising his terms. Also, a sudden US turning in this
                            direction, without punishing the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            above present levels, would have a seriously dispiriting effect upon
                            non-Communists in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option D</p>
                        <p>11. Course of Action: To increase our weight of attack on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; to increase US forces up to the 70,000
                            man strength already authorized; <pb xml:id="pg_751" n="751" facs="0783"/>and, most importantly, to place major stress on a program of
                            political, social, and economic action in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>12. Objectives: To prevent a collapse in South Vietnamese morale and
                            military capabilities during the next few months; to accomplish certain
                            improvements basic to the creation of a viable non-Communist state in
                            the South, and, meanwhile, to keep open the preceding options.</p>
                        <p>13. Consequences: Though Option D also has its drawbacks, it has the
                            following relative merits:</p>
                        <p>a. Heightened US pressure on North Vietnam would increase the difficulty
                            of supporting the Viet Cong and make Hanoi pay an ever heavier price for
                            continuing that support. Furthermore, it would demonstrate our
                            willingness to accept heightened political risks.</p>
                        <p>b. It would involve the deployment of substantial US ground forces in the
                            South—a prime requirement for the immediate future. Further, it would
                            not convey to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> the notion that the US was taking
                            over the war.</p>
                        <p>c. It would give the US time and opportunity to increase the civic
                            action, political, paramilitary, local defense, and administrative
                            improvements which are needed to create a viable non-Communist state in
                            the South.</p>
                        <p>d. The net effect of the foregoing would have some chance of persuading
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> that time was no longer running
                            their way and that they should move to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>e. The US would avoid the negative reactions abroad and at home which
                            would be produced by all-out bombings of the DRV and ever-increasing US
                            troop commitments.</p>

                        <p>RE</p>
                        <p>Whether further Congressional approval is necessary or desirable in
                            connection with proposed deployment and use of troops in South
                            Vietnam</p>
                        <p>You have asked for my views as to whether further Congressional approval
                            should be sought in connection with the proposed deployment <pb xml:id="pg_752" n="752" facs="0784"/>and use of troops in South
                            Vietnam. What is contemplated, as I understand it, is (1) an increase of
                            30 to 40,000 in the number of troops stationed in South Vietnam, now
                            approximately 50,000 and (2) the use of such troops, in one to
                            two-battalion strength, for attacks on concentrations of Viet Cong
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The use of troops being contemplated would involve some departure from
                            the functions generally served by U.S. ground forces previously, i.e.,
                            as “advisers” accompanying South Vietnamese forces, or as guards engaged
                            in protecting U.S. installations and forces against attack. The
                            operations being contemplated would involve attacks on “targets of
                            opportunity” located as much as 150 miles distant from U.S.
                            installations. The objective would be to have the U.S. forces act as a
                            light, mobile reserve to South Vietnamese ground forces, able to strike
                            quickly at the request of such forces when heavy concentrations of Viet
                            Cong forces are detected. All of the activities being contemplated would
                            be undertaken with the consent of the government of South Vietnam and
                            would be limited to the territory of that country.</p>
                        <p>It is my view that, as a matter of law, further Congressional approval at
                            this time is not necessary.</p>

                            of the armed forces (Article II, section 2), and as the sole organ of
                            the United States in the field of foreign relations (United States v.
                            Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)), to deploy and use the
                            armed forces abroad. This authority has generally been broadly
                            interpreted, and the armed forces have been used without legislative
                            authority on scores of occasions including those involving “acts of
                            war.”</p>
                        <p>In the absence of some action by Congress, the only legal limitation on
                            the power of the President to commit the armed forces arises by
                            implication from Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, under which
                            only Congress is authorized to “declare war.” I believe it is a fair,
                            although not uncontroversial, summary of nearly two centuries of history
                            to say that the power to “declare war” is the power to confer
                            substantially unlimited authority to use the armed forces to conquer
                            and, if necessary, subdue a foreign nation. Unless such unlimited
                            authority is exercised by the President, his legal position in using the
                            armed forces is sustainable. It has been argued that the President may,
                            without Congressional approval, take only urgent defensive measures, or
                            that he may take only minor police measures that are not likely to
                            commit the United States to full scale war. However, the action taken by
                            President Truman in Korea, which is not widely regarded as having been
                            illegal, shows how extensive the powers of the President may be. The
                            same illustration also <pb xml:id="pg_753" n="753" facs="0785"/>shows
                            how inextricably tied together the legal and policy issues involved in
                            such a situation necessarily are.</p>
                        <p>On many occasions the President has asked for Congressional approval of
                            his action. When Congress responds to such a request the strictly legal
                            effects of its action, if short of a declaration of war, are likely to
                            be to limit rather than extend his authority. In the absence of
                            Congressional action, the President's legal position is sustainable so
                            long as it is consistent with the Constitution, i.e., so long as his
                            action does not amount to an infringement of the power of Congress to
                            declare all-out war. There is authority, however, indicating that in
                            areas where both Executive and Congressional powers are operative, the
                            Executive must observe the limits of any Congressional authorization
                            that may be enacted even though, in the absence of any authorization,
                            his Executive powers under the Constitution would clearly go beyond the
                            Congressional grant. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
                            U.S. 579, 637, 661–662 (Justices Jackson and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark</persName>); Little v. Barreme, 2 Cranch 170, 177–178 (Chief
                            Justice <persName>Marshall</persName>). The Congressional authorization
                            obviously can serve indispensable political purposes and it may serve to
                            allay the legal doubts of narrow constructionists. These advantages must
                            be weighed, however, against the legal limitations that may be
                            effectively imposed by a Congressional authorization and its legislative
                            history.</p>
                        <p>It is my view that as President you would have the authority, in the
                            absence of any action by Congress, to use the armed forces in the manner
                            now proposed. The commitment involved is certainly far less than all-out
                            war, and the likelihood of involving the United States in all-out war as
                            a result of the proposed moves, assuming that to be a relevant
                            consideration, is relatively slight in view of the limitations on both
                            the size of the force committed and the nature of the mission. It should
                            be noted also that none of the acts proposed is an act of war against a
                            foreign nation; that is to say, the activity involved would take place
                            solely within the territory of South Vietnam and at the invitation of
                            its government, and would be directed against forces claiming to be
                            insurgents rather than the forces of a foreign nation.</p>
                        <p>I also believe it is clear that you have the legal authority to take the
                            proposed measures under the terms and legislative history of the Vietnam
                            Resolution of August 10, 1964 (P.L. 88–408, 78 Stat. 384),<note n="2" xml:id="d345fn2">This Resolution provides: <p>“The Congress approves

                                    against the forces of the United States and to prevent further

                            It was repeatedly <pb xml:id="pg_754" n="754" facs="0786"/>stated in
                            connection with those enactments that the military measures previously
                            taken, including the bombing of targets in North Vietnam, were being
                            approved by Congress. In my judgment the steps now proposed, being
                            confined to South Vietnamese territory, are of a kind with the steps
                            already approved. There is some legislative history to the effect that
                            the Congressional approval did not extend to involvement in large-scale
                            land war in Asia. In this regard, however, there were repeated
                            references to war in “division strength.” These limitations—if they
                            exist—are not infringed by the limited measures now contemplated.</p>
                        <p>“Sec. 2. The United States regards as vital to its national interest and
                            to world peace the maintenance of international peace and security in
                            Southeast Asia. Consonant with the Constitution of the United States and
                            the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with its obligations
                            under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States
                            is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all
                            necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member
                            or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty
                            requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.</p>
                        <p>“Sec. 3. This resolution shall expire when the President shall determine
                            that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by
                            international conditions created by action of the United Nations or
                            otherwise, except that it may be terminated earlier by concurrent
                            resolution of the Congress.” [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        <p>I therefore conclude that, from a legal standpoint, there is no need to
                            seek further Congressional approval at this time.</p>

                            threshold of moving the conflict in Southeast Asia to a new and higher

                            of their views that the deployment of increased numbers of jet fighters,
                            some jet light bombers, and SA–2 surface-to-air missiles to North
                            Vietnam shows a communist decision to add a new dimension to the
                            situation in Southeast Asia. Further, with respect to land combat, the
                            Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) have been engaged in a
                            build-up of their forces and are capable of mounting regimental-size
                            operations in all four corps areas and at least battalion-size
                            operations in virtually all provinces. Many <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units are well trained and equipped and some are
                            equipped with a new family of weapons. Elements of the 101st Regiment of
                            the 325th North Vietnamese Army (<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>)
                            Division are in the northern zone of II Corps area, and it is possible
                            that elements of two other regiments of the division are now deployed
                            within the provinces of Kontum-Pleiku and Phu Bon or in nearby Laos.
                            Elements of the 304th <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> Division are
                            suspected to be in Southern Laos, capable of early movement into the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. The communists recently have
                            shown a willingness to take heavy losses to achieve their objectives. So
                            far, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have not employed their full
                            capabilities. Only two of the nine <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            regiments have been heavily engaged and probably only a similar
                            proportion of their separate battalions have been committed. Recent
                            events as well as captured VC prisoners and documents suggest that a
                            summer campaign is now underway to destroy government forces and,
                            concurrently, first to isolate and then attack district and province
                            towns.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> ground forces are in a precarious
                            position as to their capability to withstand such an offensive. As a
                            result of recent heavy engagements with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> reports
                            that some <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units are beginning to
                            show signs of reluctance to take necessary offensive actions and, in
                            some areas, their steadfastness under fire is coming into doubt. Planned
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> force build-ups have been
                            suspended until November, because of the requirement to allocate
                            available resources toward reconstituting units recently combat-attired.
                            Thus, it is estimated that a further deterioration in the near term will
                            occur through change of force ratios in favor of the communist units in
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. While a formal appraisal in the form of a <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> has not
                            been conducted, informal polling of the intelligence community <pb xml:id="pg_756" n="756" facs="0788"/>indicates general agreement
                            with the <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> views regarding
                            the enemy and friendly situation in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>5. In this unstable military situation, appropriate countermeasures are
                            required. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the ground forces
                            situation requires a substantial further build-up of US and Allied
                            forces in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, at the most rapid
                            rate feasible on an orderly basis. The Appendix hereto<note n="4" xml:id="d346fn4">Not printed.</note> summarizes US and Allied forces
                            required now for this build-up, designed to provide a substantial and
                            necessary increase in offensive capability. The recommended deployments

                            foresees no political problems with the Government of Vietnam in the
                            introduction of these forces. Lists in the appendix may be further

                        <p>6. In addition to the above deployments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider that air action against North Vietnam should be intensified to
                            include increased armed reconnaissance of LOCs and strikes against
                            militarily important targets. Such action is necessary to reduce <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> capabilities to support the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>, further punish the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and further establish US intent to prevent a communist

                        <p>7. In addition to the actions recommended in <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–415–65, <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–442–65,
                            and paragraph 6, above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the
                            deployments shown in the Appendix be approved now for
                            implementation.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by discussing the Administration's
                            authority to act in Vietnam which is now based on the Gulf of Tonkin
                                resolution.<note n="2" xml:id="d347fn2">Reference is to the Joint
                                Resolution To Promote the Maintenance of International Peace and
                                Security in Southeast Asia, August 10, 1964, P.L. 88–408. See <ref target="#d345fn2">footnote 2, Document 345</ref>.</note> The
                            debate now going on in the Senate was referred to.</p>
                        <p>The President: We have a treaty obligation and we intend to keep our
                            commitment. Some say we should get out of Vietnam while others say we
                            should do more. We should seek ways of holding the situation so that we
                            can carry out what we are committed to do.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: It has been two
                            months since my last personal report to you. General Quat is still in
                            power. He managed to handle the South Vietnamese generals in such a way
                            as to get General Khanh ousted and to end the Military Council.
                            Political life is still determined by three groups—the generals, the
                            southerners, and the Catholics. Minor or even major changes are possible
                            because the political impasse still continues. Elections last
                                Sunday<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">June 6.</note> turned out well,
                            with a large number of voters registering. There was no effective <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> opposition.</p>
                        <p>As to the military situation, the recent tranquility was due to
                            retraining and re-equipping. Ten days ago, the monsoon campaign began.
                            Its intensity will be greater than in years past. The South Vietnamese
                            manpower shortage in their military forces is serious. Their problem is
                            to raise the total military force and substantially decrease desertions.
                            The superiority of South Vietnamese military forces over the Viet Cong
                            has dropped from 5.4 : 1 to 3.9 : 1. This lower ratio is the
                            justification for the introduction of additional U.S. forces. There are
                            about 50,000 U.S. forces which will soon go to 70,000.</p>
                        <p>The present <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> campaign will be terminated
                            without serious losses. With more U.S. combat troops and more U.S. air
                            power, the hope is that we will be able to push Hanoi into
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: U.S. force
                            levels are now: 12,000 ground combat men; 7,000 attached to air combat;
                            and 30,000 supporting including advisers, communication forces and
                            logistic support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: We estimate the
                            Viet Cong forces at 42–50,000.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Our estimate
                            of the future Viet Cong strength is 64,000—a huge increase over last
                            year.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: The increase in
                            the Viet Cong forces came before our bombing. North Vietnam infiltration
                            has been slowed down by our bombing.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Our bombing has
                            slowed down the entire North Vietnamese transportation system.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We have listed 13
                            channels which have been used to probe enemy intentions. There are now
                            few tracks open or operating. A Geneva type conference proposal is still
                            alive. One thought would be to have the seventeen-nations<note n="4" xml:id="d347fn4">See <ref target="#d228fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    228</ref>.</note> issue invitations to a conference of
                            governments for talks without preconditions. The other side will turn
                            down such a proposal, awaiting the outcome of the monsoon campaign.</p>
                        <p>Today we see no possibility of talks. Although we are alert to all
                            tracks, none appear promising. We should not be too timid about the
                            present U.S. position on North Vietnam. We have more support than the
                            Communists say we have. (Summary of the peace probes<note n="5" xml:id="d347fn5">A copy of this summary was sent to Bromley Smith at

                            by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to several
                            Council members, including the President.)</p>
                        <p>The President: We should get out the contents of this summary to the
                            public by means of speeches and TV appearances. We should show what we
                            have tried to do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General should be asked to call
                            for a cease-fire during negotiations. The Secretary General's proposal
                            would probably be turned down by Hanoi. Even so, taking this initiative
                            would prove that we have tried everything.</p>
                        <p>The President: This proposal should be explored with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. When we tried a bombing pause, I
                            didn't believe it would work, and it didn't. It did relieve the pressure
                            of public opinion.</p>

                            battalions—123,000 men. The Chiefs are opposed to the <pb xml:id="pg_759" n="759" facs="0791"/>deployment of U.S. forces in
                            the highlands of South Vietnam and want the new forces to be used as a

                        </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces did not do as well as we
                            expected. The Chiefs are impressed by General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s presentation of the
                            need for more U.S. forces. The ratio between friendly plus U.S. forces
                            as opposed to Viet Cong forces is now unfavorable. The Defense
                            Department's proposal calls for deploying fewer troops now than either
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> or the
                            Joint Chiefs recommend. The Chiefs favor taking a decision now on
                            sending the number of troops recommended by General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. The <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> plan<note n="8" xml:id="d347fn8">See <ref target="#d343fn2">Document 343 and

                            keep our option open to send additional forces later.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary [Attorney General] <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: There is no doubt of our legal position to
                            increase force deployments in Vietnam. It is doubtful that we should go
                            back to Congress to get additional authority every time we take a new
                            action. The President already has, under the Constitution, all the power
                            he needs to deploy additional forces abroad.<note n="9" xml:id="d347fn9">Legal opinions supporting this conclusion were submitted to the

                        <p>The President: We must delay and deter the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
                            as much as we can, and as simply as we can, without going all out. When
                            we grant General Westmoreland's request, it means that we get in deeper
                            and it is harder to get out. They think they are winning and we think
                            they are. We must determine which course gives us the maximum protection

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Begin Text.</hi> The United States Government is
                            gravely concerned by the continuing political instability of the
                            Government of Viet-Nam. In recent weeks there have been particular
                            difficulties in this area which we would like to bring quite informally
                            to the attention of the appropriate authorities of the Vatican. We
                            recognize entirely that the Church would not wish to take a direct part
                            in any merely political difference, but it does appear to us that the
                            current difficulties could easily have results which would be deeply
                            damaging to the interests of the Catholic community in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The current situation is not that there is political pressure against
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> and that
                            much of it is under the leadership of Catholics, including especially a
                            group of Northern Catholic refugee priests. While we see no intent on
                            the part of the Prime Minister to repress any religion or to pose any
                            threat to the general position of Catholics, we of course recognize the
                            intense feelings which animate many of these Catholic refugees, who have
                            been through great suffering and provocation in the past.</p>
                        <p>But the present danger of their pressures is that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_Quat1">Quat</persName> may be forced to seek
                            military intervention—or that the military themselves may lose patience
                            and reestablish direct military rule. It is also quiet possible that the
                            position now being taken by some of the Northern Catholic leaders may
                            provoke a very strong reaction from the Buddhist majority. Explosive
                            developments of this sort would not be in the interest of the Catholic
                            community or of Viet-Nam as a whole. This kind of bitter division among
                            free citizens of Viet-Nam can only serve the purpose of the Communists
                            who are seeking to take over the whole country.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that this general situation is very well and clearly
                            understood by Archbishop Palmas, the Apostolic Delegate. He is a strong
                            man, and he understands the situation clearly. We believe it would be
                            greatly in the interest of the Catholic community in Viet-Nam if the
                            authorities in Rome were able to give Archbishop Palmas unusually <pb xml:id="pg_761" n="761" facs="0793"/>wide discretion and authority
                            in his relations with local Catholic leaders at this critical time.</p>
                        <p>We repeat that we understand clearly the sensitivity of this problem.
                            These comments are forwarded only because of our deep conviction that
                            the true interests of Catholics and the interests of the United States
                            in Viet-Nam are the same. End Text.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>The attached was prepared to assist me in pulling together some of my
                            thoughts on the situation in Vietnam. It was also designed to serve me
                            as a resume of intelligence community views which have been set forth in
                            the recent National Intelligence Estimates. Because every effort was
                            made to keep the present document to minimum length, departures from the
                            full texts—as agreed—were unavoidable. Even though there are numerous
                            estimates on the subject, they do not cover all of the major points
                            presently under discussion. Accordingly, my staff has supplemented
                            community findings with judgments very generally agreed to within the
                            Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                        <p>I myself have found the document useful and forward it to you for your
                            information, emphasizing again that you should consider it a
                            special-purpose briefing note and in no sense an agreed pronouncement of
                            the United States Intelligence Board.</p>

                        <p>I. The Communists think they are winning the war in South Vietnam,
                            because:</p>
                        <p>(a) It is a guerrilla war, of small-scale operations, in jungle and
                            difficult terrain, where advanced weapons, air power, and large-unit
                            formations are not of decisive importance;</p>
                        <p>The main judgments here are found most recently in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–6–65 of 2 June 1965<note n="5" xml:id="d350fn5">See <ref target="#d318">Document 318</ref>.</note>
                            (para. 3 for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, para. 7 for the
                            Chinese).</p>
                        <p>(b) it is a “war of national liberation”—a political and social
                            struggle—the kind of struggle which they believe they will inevitably
                            win;</p>
                        <p>Virtually all the Estimates stress Communist confidence in ultimate
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>(c) they think the US does not understand how to fight such a war;</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_765" n="765" facs="0797"/>
                        <p>(d) they perceive the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese government;</p>
                        <p>(e) they remember that they defeated the French;</p>
                        <p>(f) finally, they think they are winning because in fact they are
                            winning. (See General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s recent cable.)<note n="6" xml:id="d350fn6">

                        <p>No <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> would declare that the Communists
                            are winning the war, and none does.</p>
                        <p>II. As long as the Communists think they are winning in South Vietnam,
                            bombing of North Vietnam is unlikely to lead them to make conciliatory
                            gestures.</p>
                        <p>This proposition is most recently in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–6–65, 2 June 1965, applying, however, only to
                            bombing as in (a) and (b).</p>
                        <p>Bombing of North Vietnam could be:</p>
                        <p>(a) limited to targets and areas approximately as at present;</p>
                        <p>Since February 1965, <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s have stated
                            that this degree of bombing would not lead Hanoi to make conciliatory
                            gestures.</p>
                        <p>(b) extended to airfields and <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> sites
                            near Hanoi (and done with <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            aircraft);</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–6–65 (2 June 1965) says odds
                            are against this leading Hanoi to conciliatory gestures. (Air Force
                            dissents)</p>
                        <p>(c) extended (gradually) to North Vietnamese industrial and economic
                            targets (not population centers as such);</p>

                            dissenting) that “if the US vigorously continued in its attacks and
                            damaged some important economic or military assets the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>…might decide to intensify the struggle,
                            but…it seems to us somewhat more likely that they would decide to make
                            some effort to secure a respite from US attack. …”</p>
                        <p>The 2 June <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>, however, in effect
                            though not specifically, reversed this judgment.</p>

                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic">As long as the Communists think they are winning
                                in South Vietnam it is unlikely that Chinese Communists or Soviets
                                will intervene with substantial military forces of their own, in
                                combat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The message of all recent <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s is in
                            agreement with this proposition, for three main reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. Such intervention would not be necessary.</p>
                        <p>2. It would involve China and Russia in undesired risk of larger war with
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>3. The North Vietnamese do not want a massive Chinese Communist presence
                            in their country, at least not until their regime is facing severe
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>Note however that continuance of the flow of military supplies,
                            equipment, and probably small numbers of technical and training
                            personnel from China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            North Vietnam is virtually certain.</p>
                        <p>The chances of large-scale <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> invasion,
                            of attacks on US aircraft carriers or bases, or of large-scale Chinese
                            Communist military intervention call for further consideration, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">Contingencies</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Large-scale, overt, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> invasion of South Vietnam—on the “Korean”
                                model.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(a) Appears to us to be militarily imprudent. The only north-south road
                            is the coast road, open to US air and naval bombardment.</p>
                        <p>Estimated in 10–6–65, 2 June, as unlikely in response to <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bombings of North Vietnamese airfields
                            and SAM sites, because of the risks to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> in such an invasion.</p>
                        <pb xml:id="pg_767" n="767" facs="0799"/>
                        <p>(b) Caution. This does not rule out accelerated and substantial
                            infiltration of regular <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces along
                            trails west of the coastal plain. This is occurring and probably will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>But <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 10–5–65, 28 April,<note n="8" xml:id="d350fn8">Not printed. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/EAP Files: Lot 90 D 99)</note> says
                            that if the US bombed China in sustained fashion “the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> armed forces, with Chinese support,
                            would probably open an offensive against South Vietnam.” (This may not
                            mean a “Korean style” offensive, however, but a greatly intensified
                            insurgency effort within South Vietnam.)</p>
                        <p>All Estimates on the matter allow for the possibility of such an
                            invasion. State consistently has judged it more likely, in certain
                            contingencies, than have the other Agencies.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Attacks on US carriers or on US air bases in South
                                Vietnam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Attacks on carriers are barely possible with Chinese Communist
                            submarines, possible with Soviet submarines, possible but almost
                            suicidal with IL-28's.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of such attacks is recognized in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s, but (except for sabotage or sneak attacks on US
                            airfields) they are deemed unlikely.</p>
                        <p>Attacks on airfields in South Vietnam are possible but very dangerous
                            with IL-28's from North Vietnam; are highly likely by sabotage
                            teams.</p>

                            of North Vietnamese airfields, especially if these airfields were under

                        <p>(b) Chinese Communist aircraft from bases in China. State considered this
                            likely if US bombing extended to northern North Vietnam. All other

                            would probably move forces “into North Vietnam” and Northern Laos, and

                            as obdurate as the Chinese, and have apparently grown more so in recent

                            cannot force the DRV to a settlement, and there is no reason to suppose
                            that they feel either the necessity or the desire to work towards a
                            settlement on US terms. Their attitude has hardened in recent weeks. It
                            is worth noting that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> have reversed
                            Khrushchev's policy of disengagement from the Vietnam problem.</p>
                        <p>All this is in accord with <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s and
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>'s.</p>

                        <p>IV. The Sino-Soviet quarrel is a factor of first importance. Much
                            simplified:</p>
                        <p>(a) The Chinese maintain their extreme revolutionary posture, expecting
                            that a successful outcome in Vietnam (from their point of view) will
                            enhance their position in the Communist world and among underdeveloped
                            nations. They wish to maximize their influence in North Vietnam, at
                            Soviet expense.</p>
                        <p>(b) The Soviets cannot afford (even if they wish) to appear backward in
                            their support of a “revolutionary struggle.” But they are challenging
                            Chinese influence in North Vietnam by supplying things (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>'s, <gloss target="#t_IL281">IL-28</gloss>'s) which the Chinese cannot produce.</p>
                        <p>(c) The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> appears eager to balance the
                            overwhelming Chinese presence (owing to size and proximity) in their
                            affairs with a growing Soviet involvement.</p>
                        <p>Generally in accord with various <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>
                            pronouncements.</p>
                        <p>V. The fragility of the governmental structure in South Vietnam is also
                            an important factor in Communist calculations.</p>
                        <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Free World Attitudes</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is widespread disapproval of US actions in Vietnam in the Free
                            World generally, including the US itself.</p>

                        <p>We believe that the Communists rely heavily on this feeling to restrain
                            the US from (1) anything approaching unrestricted bombing of North
                            Vietnam and (2) widening the area and scope of the war.</p>
                        <p>Emphasized in all <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p>Communist diplomacy and propaganda are vigorous in encouraging the
                            disapproval of US policy. It is an extremely important element in their
                            general line of policy.</p>
                        <p>Emphasized in all <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>'s.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>One Estimate—that on reactions to US bombing of China—deals in its final
                            section with a situation of general war in the Far East—perhaps in the
                            world. We note that except for this, all the Estimates deal with
                            situations of moderate or limited escalation (or no escalation). The
                            general proposition is that the Communists will try to restrain further
                            expansion of military conflict—if only because they are doing well in
                            conflict on the present scale.</p>

                            issued letters of instruction2 to the III Marine Amphibious Force and to
                            the 173d Airborne Brigade <pb xml:id="pg_773" n="773" facs="0805"/>after
                            full coordination with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which
                            sets forth three stages through which US would progress. Stage 1 was
                            related to the security of the base area and included active patrolling.
                            Stage 2 included deep patrolling and offensive operations. Initial
                            offensive operations were to be unilateral and then combined in order to
                            iron out coordination procedures with the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. The III <gloss target="#t_MAF1">MAF</gloss> has
                            already conducted some such combined operations. The 173d Airborne
                            Brigade was scheduled to conduct its combined operation on 11 June.
                            However, this operation was postponed owing to the commitment of
                            helicopters and III Corps troops to the relief of Dong Oai. Stage 3
                            involves commitment of US forces in reserve reaction operations in
                            conjunction with RVNAF as necessary and also includes offensive
                            operations or search and destroy operations in coordination with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. In full coordination with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            Headquarters, both the 173d and III <gloss target="#t_MAF1">MAF</gloss>
                            were to enter Stage 3 about 15 June. Instructions to this effect have
                            already been issued by the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> Joint
                            General Staff to their corps commanders. In view of the statements made
                            in Washington by the Secretary of State and at the White House,<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">See <ref target="#d339">Document
                                339</ref>.</note> we have, of course, deferred the movement from
                            Stage 2 to Stage 3 and, in addition, we have restricted US combat troops
                            to their tactical areas of responsibility which are associated directly
                            with the defense of the installations near which they are located.</p>
                        <p>3. The fact is, we have moved some distance down the road toward the
                            active commitment of US combat forces and we have done so hand-in-hand
                            with our Vietnamese ally. They now expect and anticipate this kind of
                            participation. They and we recognize that the time has come when such
                            support is essential to the survival of any government of South Vietnam
                            and the integrity of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore, we recommend that the concept for employment and the
                            letters of instruction be modified as follows and approved as a matter
                            of urgency:</p>
                        <p>A. The tactical areas of responsibility around air bases and base areas
                            where US troops are located will be extended or expanded into all
                            adjacent <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> concentrations or base areas
                            which threaten the installations in question. This will permit offensive
                            operations, combined or unilateral, in direct relation to the defensive
                            mission. This seems to us fully compatible with para 1 of State
                            Department Circular 2483 of 10 June<note n="4" xml:id="d351fn4">Not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> in which the Secretary of State is quoted as
                            follows: “Now obviously we don't expect these men to sit there like
                            hypnotized rabbits waiting for the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to
                            strike. They are now in the surrounding countryside to be sure that <pb xml:id="pg_774" n="774" facs="0806"/>the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are kept off balance and a strong striking force is not
                            organized in the neighborhood to strike these installations.”</p>
                        <p>B. We will organize and plan with the Vietnamese for the commitment of US
                            reserve reaction forces to be called upon by the Vietnamese when in
                            their opinion and ours the general reserve of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> has been committed or is not immediately available.
                            This we regard as entirely compatible with the statement issued from the
                            White House on 9 June which says: “General Westmoreland also has
                            authority within the assigned mission to employ these troops in support
                            of Vietnamese forces faced with aggressive attacks when other effective
                            reserves are not available and when in his judgment the general military
                            situation urgently requires it.”</p>
                        <p>5. We have reached a point in Vietnam where we cannot avoid the
                            commitment to combat of US ground troops. Our objective is to maintain
                            intact the Government of South Vietnam and its armed forces. They can no
                            longer cope alone with the increased VC DRV threat. They (the
                            Vietnamese) are fully aware of this fact and need and expect US support.
                            We see no difficulty in explaining the actions described above in
                            accordance with the terms set forth in the White House and the State
                            Department messages.</p>
                        <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has read and

                                added that “it seems inevitable that further definition may serve to
