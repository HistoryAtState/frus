                <head>Message of the president of the United States to Congress, December 6,
                    1927</head>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Members of the Congress</hi>: It is gratifying to report
                    that for the fourth consecutive year the state of the Union in general is good.
                    We are at peace. The country as a whole has had a prosperity never exceeded.
                    Wages are at their highest range, employment is plentiful. Some parts of
                    agriculture and industry have lagged; some localities have suffered from storm
                    and flood. But such losses have been absorbed without serious detriment to our
                    great economic structure. Stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution
                    is prevalent. Rates of interest for industry, agriculture, and government have
                    been reduced. Savers and investors are providing capital for new construction in
                    industry and public works. The purchasing power of agriculture has increased. If
                    the people maintain that confidence which they are entitled to have in
                    themselves, in each other, and in America, a comfortable prosperity will
                    continue.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Constructive Economy</hi></p>
                <p>Without constructive economy in Government expenditures we should not now be
                    enjoying these results or these prospects. Because we are not now physically at
                    war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debt still remains. The
                    Nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by a stern self-denial in
                    public expenditures, until we have conquered the disabilities of our public
                    finance. While our obligation to veterans and dependents is large and
                    continuing, the heavier burden of the national debt is being steadily
                    eliminated. At the end of this fiscal year it will be reduced from about
                    $26,600,000,000 to about $17,975,000,000. Annual interest, including war
                    savings, will have been reduced from $1,055,000,000 to $670,000,000. The
                    sacrifices of the people, the economy of the Government, are showing remarkable
                    results. They should be continued for the purpose of relieving the Nation of the
                    burden of interest and debt and releasing revenue for internal improvements and
                    national development.</p>
                <p>Not only the amount, but the rate, of Government interest has been reduced.
                    Callable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year the average
                    rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell below 4
                    percent. Keeping the credit of the Nation high is a tremendously profitable
                    operation.</p>
                <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Tax Reduction</hi></p>
                <p>The immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax
                    reduction. The annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is $212,000,000.
                    Without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth proposing. The
                    three measures already enacted leave our Government revenues where they are not
                    oppressive. Exemptions have been increased until 115,000,000 people make but
                    2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so that further reduction should be mainly
                    for the purpose of removing inequalities. The Secretary of the Treasury has
                    recommended a measure which would give us a much better balanced system of
                    taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue. It has my complete
                    support.</p>
                <p>Unforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. Our probable surplus
                    for June 30, 1929, is small. A slight depression in business would greatly
                    reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation. The people ought
                    to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate and fair taxes
                    which might produce a deficit. We must keep our budget balanced for each year.
                    That is the corner stone of our national credit, the trifling price we pay to
                    command the lowest rate of interest of any great power in the world. Any surplus
                    can be applied to debt reduction, and debt reduction is tax reduction. Under the
                    present circumstances it would be far better to leave the rates as they are than
                    to enact a bill carrying the peril of a deficit. This is not a problem to be
                    approached in a narrow or partisan spirit. All of those who participate in
                    finding a reasonable solution will be entitled to participate in any credit that
                    accrues from it without regard to party. The Congress has already demonstrated
                    that tax legislation can be removed from purely political consideration into the
                    realm of patriotic business principles.</p>
                <p>Any bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible for
                    raising, managing, and expending the finances of the Government. If special
                    interests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the national needs as a
                    whole, with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of
                    propaganda, are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from
                    taxation, we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust, bad for business,
                    bad for the country, probably resulting in a deficit, with disastrous financial
                    consequences. The Constitution has given the Members of the Congress sole
                    authority to decide what tax measures shall be presented for approval. While
                    welcoming information from any quarter, the Congress should continue to exercise
                    its own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interests of the
                    country as taxation.</p>
                <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">National Defense</hi></p>
                <p>Being a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, to
                    maintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in a form
                    adapted solely to defense. It should be continued with a very generous supply of
                    officers and with the present base of personnel, subject to fluctuations which
                    may be temporarily desirable.</p>
                <p>The five-year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same policy and
                    commensurate with the notable contributions of America to the science of
                    aeronautics. The provisions of the law lately enacted are being executed as fast
                    as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable development permit.</p>
                <p>While our Army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a high state
                    of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its immediate
                    expansion. The garrison ration has lately been increased. Recommendations for an
                    appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made to the previous Congress failed
                    to pass. While most of the Army is well housed, some of it which is quartered in
                    war-time training camps is becoming poorly housed. In the past three years
                    $12,533,000 have been appropriated for reconstruction and repairs, and an
                    authorization has been approved of $22,301,000 for new housing, under which
                    $8,070,000 has already been appropriated. A law has also been passed, complying
                    with the request of the War Department, allocating funds received from the sale
                    of buildings and land for housing purposes. The work, however, is not completed,
                    so that other appropriations are being recommended.</p>
                <p>Our Navy is likewise a weapon of defense. We have a foreign commerce and ocean
                    lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. We have outlying territory in
                    the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded with the richest
                    cities in the world. We are responsible for the protection of a large population
                    and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any people. We are charged with an
                    international duty of defending the Panama Canal. To meet these responsibilities
                    we need a very substantial sea armament. It needs aircraft development, which is
                    being provided under the five-year program. It needs submarines as soon as the
                    department decides upon the best type of construction. It needs airplane
                    carriers and a material addition to its force of cruisers. We can plan for the
                    future and begin a moderate building program.</p>
                <p>This country has put away the Old World policy of competitive armaments. It can
                    never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense. We have
                    one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part for a
                    limitation in naval <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>armament. After
                    most careful preparation, extending over months, we recently made every effort
                    to secure a three-power treaty to the same end. We were granted much cooperation
                    by Japan, but we were unable to come to an agreement with Great Britain. While
                    the results of the conference were of considerable value, they were mostly of a
                    negative character. We know now that no agreement can be reached which will be
                    inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part. We are ready and
                    willing to continue the preparatory investigations on the general subject of
                    limitation of armaments which have been started under the auspices of the League
                    of Nations.</p>
                <p>We have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete. Everyone
                    knew that had a three-power agreement been reached it would have left us with
                    the necessity of continuing our building program. The failure to agree should
                    not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise should. Any future
                    treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. We should enter on no
                    competition. We should refrain from no needful program. It should be made clear
                    to all the world that lacking a definite agreement, the attitude of any other
                    country is not to be permitted to alter our own policy. It should especially be
                    demonstrated that propaganda will not cause us to change our course. Where there
                    is no treaty limitation, the size of the Navy which America is to have will be
                    solely for America to determine. No outside influence should enlarge it or
                    diminish it. But it should be known to all that our military power holds no
                    threat of aggrandizement. It is a guaranty of peace and security at home, and
                    when it goes abroad it is an instrument for the protection of the legal rights
                    of our citizens under international law, a refuge in time of disorder, and
                    always the servant of world peace. Wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity
                    increase.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Merchant Marine</hi></p>
                <p>The United States Government fleet is transporting a large amount of freight and
                    reducing its drain on the Treasury. The Shipping Board is constantly under
                    pressure, to which it too often yields, to protect private interests, rather
                    than serve the public welfare. More attention should be given to merchant ships
                    as an auxiliary of the Navy. The possibility of including their masters and
                    crews in the Naval Reserve, with some reasonable compensation, should be
                    thoroughly explored as a method of encouraging private operation of shipping.
                    Public operation is not a success. No investigation, of which I have caused
                    several to be made, has failed to report that it could not succeed or to
                    recommend speedy transfer to private ownership. Our exporters and importers are
                    both indifferent about using <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0013"/>American
                    ships. It should be our policy to keep our present vessels in repair and dispose
                    of them as rapidly as possible, rather than undertake any new construction.
                    Their operation is a burden on the National Treasury, for which we are not
                    receiving sufficient benefits.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Commercial Aviation</hi></p>
                <p>A rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. The Department of Commerce has
                    charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national
                    airways. Almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000 miles more
                    contemplated. Nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000 miles more will
                    have lighting and emergency landing fields by next July. Air mail contracts are
                    expected to cover 24 of these lines. Daily airway flying is nearly 15,000 miles
                    and is expected to reach 25,000 miles early next year.</p>
                <p>Flights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. Over 900 airports,
                    completed and uncompleted, have been laid out. The demand for aircraft has
                    greatly increased. The policy already adopted by the Congress is producing the
                    sound development of this coming industry.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Western Hemisphere Air Mail</hi></p>
                <p>Private enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service to
                    Mexico and Central and South America. We are particularly solicitous to have the
                    United States take a leading part in this development. It is understood that the
                    governments of our sister countries would be willing to cooperate. Their
                    physical features, the undeveloped state of their transportation, make an air
                    service especially adaptable to their usage. The Post Office Department should
                    be granted power to make liberal long-term contracts for carrying our mail, and
                    authority should be given to the Army and the Navy to detail aviators and planes
                    to cooperate with private enterprise in establishing such mail service with the
                    consent of the countries concerned. A committee of the Cabinet will later
                    present a report on this subject.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Good Roads</hi></p>
                <p>The importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be
                    appreciated. The National Government has been making liberal contributions to
                    encourage their construction. The results and benefits have been very
                    gratifying. National participation, however, should be confined to trunk-line
                    systems. The national tax on automobiles is now nearly sufficient to meet this
                    outlay. This tax is very small, and on low-priced cars is not more than $2 or $3
                    each year.</p>
                <p>While the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire for improved
                    highways is not limited to our own country. It should <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X"

                    points in Canada are already accessible. We ought to lend our encouragement in
                    any way we can for more good roads to all the principal points in this
                    hemisphere south of the Rio Grande. It has been our practice to supply these
                    countries with military and naval advisers, when they have requested it, to
                    assist them in national defense. The arts of peace are even more important to
                    them and to us. Authority should be given by law to provide them at their
                    request with engineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges. In
                    some of these countries already wonderful progress is being made in road
                    building, but the engineering features are often very exacting and the financing
                    difficult. Private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loans
                    sought by these countries to open such main lines of travel.</p>
                <p>This general subject has been promoted by the Pan American Congress of Highways,
                    which will convene again at Rio de Janeiro in July, 1928. It is desirable that
                    the Congress should provide for the appointment of delegates to represent the
                    Government of the United States.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Cuban Parcel Post</hi></p>
                <p>We have a temporary parcel-post convention with Cuba. The advantage of it is all
                    on our side. During 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels, weighing
                    twenty-four times as much, as we received. This convention was made on the
                    understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting the importation of
                    cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3,000 enacted in 1866 to
                    discourage smuggling, for which it has long been unnecessary. This law unjustly
                    discriminates against an important industry of Cuba. Its repeal has been
                    recommended by the Treasury and Post Office Departments. Unless this is done our
                    merchants and railroads will find themselves deprived of this large parcel-post
                    business after the 1st of next March, the date of the expiration of the
                    convention, which has been extended upon the specific understanding that it
                    would expire at that time unless this legislation was enacted. We purchase large
                    quantities of tobacco made in Cuba. It is not probable that our purchases would
                    be any larger if this law was repealed, while it would be an advantage to many
                    other industries in the United States.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Insular Possessions</hi></p>
                <p>Conditions in the Philippine Islands have been steadily improved. Contentment and
                    good order prevail. Roads, irrigation works, harbor improvements, and public
                    buildings are being constructed. Public education and sanitation have been
                    advanced. The Government <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0015"/>is in a sound
                    financial condition. These immediate results were especially due to the
                    administration of Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood. The six years of his governorship
                    marked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of the outstanding
                    accomplishments of this distinguished man. His death is a loss to the Nation and
                    the islands.</p>
                <p>Greater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put into administration,
                    if the Congress would undertake to expend, through its appropriating power, all
                    or a part of the customs revenues which are now turned over to the Philippine
                    treasury. The powers of the auditor of the islands also need revision and
                    clarification. The government of the islands is about 98 per cent in the hands
                    of the Filipinos. An extension of the policy of self-government will be hastened
                    by the demonstration on their part of their desire and their ability to carry
                    out cordially and efficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the
                    Congress for the government of the islands. It would be well for a committee of
                    the Congress to visit the islands every two years.</p>
                <p>A fair degree of progress is being made in Porto Rico. Its agricultural products
                    are increasing; its treasury position, which has given much concern, shows
                    improvement. I am advised by the governor that educational facilities are still
                    lacking. Roads are being constructed, which he represents are the first
                    requisite for building schoolhouses. The loyalty of the island to the United
                    States is exceedingly gratifying. A memorial will be presented to you requesting
                    authority to have the governor elected by the people of Porto Rico. This was
                    never done in the case of our own Territories. It is admitted that education
                    outside of the towns is as yet very deficient. Until it has progressed further
                    the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the
                    guiding hand of an appointed governor. As it is not contemplated that any change
                    should be made immediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful
                    study of the Congress.</p>

                    yielded a surplus of about $80,000,000. In order to provide additional storage
                    of water and give some control over the floods of the Chagres River, it is
                    proposed to erect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 at Alhajuela. It will take

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture</hi></p>
                <p>The past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of
                    agriculture. Production is better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy
                    surplus. Costs have been reduced and the average output of the worker increased.
                    The level of farm prices has risen, while others have fallen, so that the
                    purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure. The individual
                    farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since 1921. He has
                    adjusted his production and through cooperative organizations and other methods
                    improved his marketing. He is using authenticated facts and employing sound
                    methods which other industries are obliged to use to secure stability and
                    prosperity. The old-fashioned haphazard system is being abandoned, economics are
                    being applied to ascertain the best adapted unit of land, diversification is
                    being promoted, and scientific methods are being used in production, and
                    business principles in marketing.</p>
                <p>Agriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. The fact is that
                    economic progress never marches forward in a straight line. It goes in waves.
                    One part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes. Everybody wishes
                    agriculture to prosper. Any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will
                    have the earnest support of the Government. Their interests are not all
                    identical. Legislation should assist as many producers in as many regions as
                    possible. It should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own
                    salvation socially and economically. No plan will be of any permanent value to
                    him which does not leave him standing on his own foundation.</p>
                <p>In the past the Government has spent vast sums to bring land under cultivation.
                    It is apparent that this has reached temporarily the saturation point. We have
                    had a surplus of production and a poor market for land, which has only lately
                    shown signs of improvement. The main problem which is presented for solution is
                    one of dealing with a surplus of production. It is useless to propose a
                    temporary expedient. What is needed is permanency and stability. Government
                    price fixing is known to be unsound and bound to result in disaster. A
                    Government subsidy would work out in the same way. It can not be sound for all
                    of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the
                    producers nor the rest of the people want.</p>
                <p>Price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead of diminishing
                    it. Putting the Government directly into business is merely a combination of
                    subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure. These expedients
                    would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and how much he should
                    plant and where he <pb n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0017"/>should plant it,
                    and what and how much he should sell and where he should sell it. The most
                    effective means of dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage.
                    While this can not be done by the individual farmer, it can be done through the
                    organizations already in existence, through the information published by the
                    Department of Agriculture, and especially through banks and others who supply
                    credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all
                    those who engage in farming. If acreage becomes overextended, the Government can
                    not assume responsibility for it. The Government can, however, assist
                    cooperative associations and other organizations in orderly marketing and
                    handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions, in order to
                    save the producer from preventable loss. While it is probably impossible to
                    secure this result at a single step, and much will have to be worked out by
                    trial and rejection, a beginning could be made by setting up a Federal board or
                    commission of able and experienced men in marketing, granting equal advantages
                    under this board to the various agricultural commodities and sections of the
                    country, giving encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture, and
                    providing a revolving loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary
                    financing. Such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of
                    the surplus problem.</p>
                <p>This is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is already fairly
                    well financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing
                    associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by the regularly
                    established banks, as were the temporary operations of the War Finance
                    Corporation. Cooperative marketing especially would be provided with means of
                    buying or building physical properties.</p>
                <p>The National Government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income taxes
                    by successive tax reductions, but State and local taxes have increased, putting
                    on him a grievous burden. A policy of rigid economy should be applied to State
                    and local expenditures. This is clearly within the legislative domain of the
                    States. The Federal Government has also improved our banking structure and
                    system of agricultural credits. The farmer will be greatly benefited by similar
                    action in many States. The Department of Agriculture is undergoing changes in
                    organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory
                    divisions, that each may be better administered. More emphasis is being placed
                    on the research program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for State
                    experiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work of
                    the department. It is in this direction that much future progress can be
                    expected.</p>

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Protective Tariff</hi></p>
                <p>The present tariff rates supply the National Treasury with well over $600,000,000
                    of annual revenue. Yet, about 65 per cent of our imports come in duty free. Of
                    the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are laid about 23 per cent
                    consists of luxuries and agricultural products, and the balance of about 12 per
                    cent, amounting to around $560,000,000, is made up of manufactures and
                    merchandise. As no one is advocating any material reduction in the rates on
                    agriculture or luxuries, it is only the comparatively small amount of about
                    $560,000,000 of other imports that are really considered in any discussion of
                    reducing tariff rates. While this amount, duty free, would be large enough
                    seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country, it is of small
                    importance when spread over the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>It is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would benefit
                    agriculture. It would be interesting to know to what commodities it is thought
                    this could be applied. Everything the farmer uses in farming is already on the
                    free list. Nearly everything he sells is protected. It would seem to be obvious
                    that it is better for the country to have the farmer raise food to supply the
                    domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer. In one case our country
                    would have only the farmer; in the other it would have the farmer and the
                    manufacturer. Assuming that Europe would have more money if it sold us larger
                    amounts of merchandise, it is not certain it would consume more food, or, if it
                    did, that its purchases would be made in this country. Undoubtedly it would
                    resort to the cheapest market, which is by no means ours. The largest and best
                    and most profitable market for the farmer in the world is our own domestic
                    market. Any great increase in manufactured imports means the closing of our own
                    plants. Nothing could be worse for agriculture.</p>
                <p>Probably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures while
                    maintaining the rates on agriculture. A material reduction in either would be
                    disastrous to the farmer. It would mean a general shrinkage of values, a
                    deflation of prices, a reduction of wages, a general depression carrying our
                    people down to the low standard of living in our competing countries. It is
                    obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market for imports, which is
                    best served by maintaining our present high purchasing power under which in the
                    past five years imports have increased 63 per cent.</p>

                <p>It is exceedingly important that the Federal land and joint-stock land banks
                    should furnish the best possible service for agriculture. Certain joint-stock
                    banks have fallen into improper and unsound <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV"
                        facs="0019"/>practices, resulting in the indictment of the officials of
                    three of them. More money has been provided for examinations, and at the
                    instance of the Treasury rules and regulations of the Federal Farm Board have
                    been revised. Early last May three of its members resigned. Their places were
                    filled with men connected with the War Finance Corporation, Eugene Meyer being
                    designated as Farm Loan Commissioner. The new members have demonstrated their
                    ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of the
                    War Finance Corporation. Three joint-stock banks have gone into receivership. It
                    is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a
                    market for their bonds. A recent flotation was made at a record low rate of 4
                    percent. Careful supervision is absolutely necessary to protect the investor and
                    enable these banks to exercise their chief function in serving agriculture.</p>

                <p>The last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of Muscle Shoals.
                    Development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be produced at less
                    cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. Extensive investigation made by the
                    Department of War indicates that the nitrate plants on this project are of
                    little value for national defense and can probably be disposed of within two
                    years. The oxidation part of the plants, however, should be retained
                    indefinitely. This leaves this project mostly concerned with power. It should,
                    nevertheless, continue to be dedicated to agriculture. It is probable that this
                    desire can be best served by disposing of the plant and applying the revenues
                    received from it to research for methods of more economical production of
                    concentrated fertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating
                    its use on the farm. But in disposing of the property preference should be given
                    to proposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer
                    manufacturing.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Flood Control</hi></p>
                <p>For many years the Federal Government has been building a system of dikes along
                    the Mississippi River for protection against high water. During the past season
                    the lower States were overcome by a most disastrous flood. Many thousands of
                    square miles were inundated, a great many lives were lost, much livestock was
                    drowned, and a very heavy destruction of property was inflicted upon the
                    inhabitants. The American Red Cross at once went to the relief of the stricken
                    communities. Appeals for contributions have brought in over $17,000,000. The
                    Federal Government has provided services, equipment, and supplies probably
                    amounting to about $7,000,000 more. <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0020"
                    />Between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by local
                    railroads, the States, and their political units. Credits have been arranged by
                    the Farm Loan Board, and three emergency finance corporations with a total
                    capital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to the extent of
                    $12,000,000. Through these means the 700,000 people in the flooded areas have
                    been adequately supported. Provision has been made to care for those in need
                    until after the 1st of January.</p>
                <p>The Engineer Corps of the Army has contracted to close all breaks in the dike
                    system before the next season of high water. A most thorough and elaborate
                    survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a report with
                    recommendations for future flood control, which will be presented to the
                    Congress. The carrying out of their plans will necessarily extend over a series
                    of years. They will call for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with
                    provision for emergency spillways and improvements for the benefit of
                    navigation.</p>
                <p>Under the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one-third of the
                    cost of their construction. This has been a most extraordinary concession from
                    the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where the general rule has been that
                    the land benefited should bear the entire expense. It is true, of course, that
                    the troublesome waters do not originate on the land to be reclaimed, but it is
                    also true that such waters have a right of way through that section of the
                    country and the land there is charged with that easement. It is the land of this
                    region that is to be benefited. To say that it is unable to bear any expense of
                    reclamation is the same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. Because
                    of expenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it seems
                    probable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion of
                    cost which it should bear. But it is extremely important that it should pay
                    enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some
                    responsibility for their cost, and the neighborhood where works are constructed
                    have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravagance and securing a
                    wise and economical expenditure of public funds.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. It has been
                    so treated from its inception. Our whole people have provided with great
                    generosity for its relief. Most of the departments of the Federal Government
                    have been engaged in the same effort. The governments of the afflicted areas,
                    both State and municipal, can not be given too high praise for the courageous
                    and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people. If the
                    sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, the National Government
                    should not fail to provide generous relief. This, however, does not mean
                    restoration. The Government is not an insurer of its citizens <pb n="XVII"
                        xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0021"/>against the hazard of the elements. We shall
                    always have flood and drought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, lightning and
                    tidal wave, which are all too constant in their afflictions. The Government does
                    not undertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under such
                    circumstances. It is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding of public works
                    and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress.</p>
                <p>The people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached this
                    problem in the most generous and broad-minded way. They should be met with a
                    like spirit on the part of the National Government. This is all one country. The
                    public needs of each part must be provided for by the public at large. No
                    required relief should be refused. An adequate plan should be adopted to prevent
                    a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to
                    productivity and comfort their fields and their towns.</p>
                <p>Legislation by this Congress should be confined to our principal and most
                    pressing problem, the lower Mississippi, considering tributaries only so far as
                    they materially affect the main flood problem. A definite Federal program
                    relating to our waterways was proposed when the last Congress authorized a
                    comprehensive survey of all the important streams of the country in order to
                    provide for their improvement, including flood control, navigation, power, and
                    irrigation. Other legislation should wait pending a report on this survey. The
                    recognized needs of the Mississippi should not be made a vehicle for carrying
                    other projects. All proposals for development should stand on their own merits.
                    Any other method would result in ill-advised conclusions, great waste of money,
                    and instead of promoting would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our
                    water resources.</p>
                <p>Very recently several of the New England States have suffered somewhat similarly
                    from heavy rainfall and high water. No reliable estimate of damage has yet been
                    computed, but it is very large to private and public property. The Red Cross is
                    generously undertaking what is needed for immediate relief, repair and
                    reconstruction of houses, restocking of domestic animals, and food, clothing,
                    and shelter. A considerable sum of money will be available through the regular
                    channels in the Department of Agriculture for reconstruction of highways. It may
                    be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose. Complete reports of what is
                    required will undoubtedly be available early in the session.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Inland Navigation</hi></p>
                <p>The Congress in its last session authorized the general improvements necessary to
                    provide the Mississippi waterway system with <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII"
                        facs="0022"/>better transportation. Stabilization of the levels of the Great
                    Lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be
                    considered. Since the last session the Board of Engineers of the War Department
                    has made a report on the proposal for a canal through the State of New York, and
                    the Joint Board of Engineers, representing Canada and the United States, has
                    finished a report on the St. Lawrence River. Both of these boards conclude that
                    the St. Lawrence project is cheaper, affords a more expeditious method of
                    placing western products in European markets, and will cost less to operate. The
                    State Department has requested the Canadian Government to negotiate treaties
                    necessary to provide for this improvement. It will also be necessary to secure
                    an agreement with Canada to put in works necessary to prevent fluctuation in the
                    levels of the Great Lakes.</p>
                <p>Legislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at Boulder Canyon on the
                    Colorado River, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation. A
                    secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of
                    domestic water supply for southern California. Flood control is clearly a
                    national problem, and water supply is a Government problem, but every other
                    possibility should be exhausted before the Federal Government becomes engaged in
                    the power business. The States which are interested ought to reach mutual
                    agreement. This project is in reality their work. If they wish the Federal
                    Government to undertake it, they should not hesitate to make the necessary
                    concessions to each other. This subject is fully discussed in the annual report
                    of the Secretary of the Interior. The Columbia River Basin project is being
                    studied and will be one to be considered at some future time.</p>
                <p>The Inland Waterways Corporation is proving successful and especially beneficial
                    to agriculture. A survey is being made to determine its future needs. It has
                    never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to navigation it would
                    then be necessary for the Federal Government to provide the navigation. Such a
                    request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation is
                    not profitable, that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken at a
                    cheaper rate by some other method, in which case the hundreds of millions of
                    dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be not
                    only wasted, but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the
                    commodities of private persons for less than cost.</p>
                <p>The policy is well established that the Government should open public highways on
                    land and on water, but for use of the public in their private capacity. It has
                    put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with the expectation that if
                    they prove profitable they would pass into private hands and if they do not
                    prove profitable <pb n="XIX" xml:id="pg_XIX" facs="0023"/>they will be
                    withdrawn. The problems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken
                    up by private enterprise, so that the public will have the advantage of
                    competition in service. It is expected that some of our lines can be sold, some
                    more demonstration work done, and that with the completion of the Ohio project a
                    policy of private operation can be fully developed.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Prohibition</hi></p>
                <p>After more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted a system
                    of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an amendment to
                    the Federal Constitution. In obedience to this mandate the Congress and the
                    States, with one or two notable exceptions, have passed required laws for its
                    administration and enforcement. This imposes upon the citizenship of the
                    country, and especially on all public officers, not only the duty to enforce,
                    but the obligation to observe the sanctions of this constitutional provision and
                    its resulting laws. If this condition could be secured, all question concerning
                    prohibition would cease. The Federal Government is making every effort to
                    accomplish these results through careful organization, large appropriations, and
                    administrative effort. Smuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources
                    of supply for illegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and
                    criminal prosecution the process of enforcement is being applied. The same
                    vigilance on the part of local governments would render these efforts much more
                    successful. The Federal authorities propose to discharge their obligation for
                    enforcement to the full extent of their ability.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Negro</hi></p>
                <p>History does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length of time
                    as that which has been accomplished by the Negro race in the United States since
                    the Emancipation Proclamation. They have come up from slavery to be prominent in
                    education, the professions, art, science, agriculture, banking, and commerce. It
                    is estimated that 50,000 of them are on the Government pay rolls, drawing about
                    $50,000,000 each year. They have been the recipients of presidential
                    appointments and their professional ability has arisen to a sufficiently high
                    plane so that they have been intrusted with the entire management and control of
                    the great veterans’ hospital at Tuskegee, where their conduct has taken high
                    rank. They have shown that they have been worthy of all the encouragement which
                    they have received. Nevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless
                    and inconsiderate treatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. They
                    have especially been made the target of the <pb n="XX" xml:id="pg_XX"
                        facs="0024"/>foul crime of lynching. For several years these acts of
                    unlawful violence had been diminishing. In the last year they have shown an
                    increase. Every principle of order and law and liberty is opposed to this crime.
                    The Congress should enact any legislation it can under the Constitution to
                    provide for its elimination.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">American Indian</hi></p>
                <p>The condition of the American Indian has much improved in recent years. Full
                    citizenship was bestowed upon them on June 2, 1924, and appropriations for their
                    care and advancement have been increased. Still there remains much to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>Notable increases in appropriations for the several major functions performed by
                    the Department of the Interior on behalf of the Indians have marked the last
                    five years. In that time, successive annual increases in appropriations for
                    their education total $1,804,325; for medical care, $578,000; and for industrial
                    advancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more than would have been spent in the same
                    period on the basis of appropriations for 1923 and the preceding years.</p>
                <p>The needs along health, educational, industrial, and social lines, however, are
                    great, and the Budget estimates for 1929 include still further increases for
                    Indian administration.</p>
                <p>To advance the time when the Indians may become self-sustaining, it is my belief
                    that the Federal Government should continue to improve the facilities for their
                    care, and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the States.</p>

                <p>Legislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment by
                    the President of a Board of Mediation and Conciliation in case of actual or
                    threatened interruption of production is needed. The miners themselves are now
                    seeking information and action from the Government, which could readily be
                    secured through such a board. It is believed that a thorough investigation and
                    reconsideration of this proposed policy by the Congress will demonstrate that
                    this recommendation is sound and should be adopted.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Petroleum Conservation</hi></p>
                <p>The National Government is undertaking to join in the formation of a cooperative
                    committee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, to consider what
                    legislation by the States or by the Congress can be adopted for the preservation
                    and conservation of our supply of petroleum. This has come to be one of the main
                    dependencies for transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and
                    industrial <pb n="XXI" xml:id="pg_XXI" facs="0025"/>life. It is expected the
                    report of this committee will be available for later congressional action.
                    Meantime, the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior should make certain
                    leases of land belonging to the Osage Indians, in accordance with the act of
                    March 3, 1921, should be repealed. The authority to lease should be
                    discretionary, in order that the property of the Indians may not be wasted and
                    the public suffer a future lack of supply.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Alien Property</hi></p>
                <p>Under treaty the property held by the Alien Property Custodian was to be retained
                    until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of American claims.
                    While still protecting the American claimants, in order to afford every possible
                    accommodation to the nationals of the countries whose property was held, the
                    Congress has made liberal provision for the return of a large part of the
                    property. All trusts under $10,000 were returned in full, and partial returns
                    were made on the others. The total returned was approximately $350,000,000.</p>
                <p>There is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. The Mixed Claims
                    Commissions has made such progress in the adjudication of claims that
                    legislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property, which
                    should be done under conditions which will protect our Government and our
                    claimants. Such a measure will be proposed, and I recommend its enactment.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Railroad Consolidation</hi></p>
                <p>In order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost to
                    the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. Legislation is needed to
                    simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and arrangements for
                    consolidation, always under the control and with the approval of the Interstate
                    Commerce Commission. Pending this, no adequate or permanent reorganization can
                    be made of the freight-rate structure. Meantime, both agriculture and industry
                    are compelled to wait for needed relief. This is purely a business question,
                    which should be stripped of all local and partisan bias and decided on broad
                    principles and its merits in order to promote the public welfare. A large amount
                    of new construction and equipment, which will furnish employment for labor and
                    markets for commodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of this
                    important question. Delay is holding back the progress of our country.</p>
                <p>Many of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the Washington

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Veterans</hi></p>
                <p>The care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all men. The
                    yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about the cost of
                    running the Federal Government, outside of the Post Office Department, before
                    the World War. The Congress will have before it recommendations of the American
                    Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other like organizations, which should
                    receive candid consideration. We should continue to foster our system of
                    compensation and rehabilitation, and provide hospitals and insurance. The
                    magnitude of the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for
                    further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny. Our present system
                    of pensions is already sufficiently liberal. It was increased by the last
                    Congress for Civil and Spanish War veterans and widows and for some
                    dependents.</p>
                <p>It has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing with
                    veterans’ relief be consolidated. This would bring many advantages. It is
                    recommended that the proper committees of the Congress make a thorough survey of
                    this subject, in order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation
                    is desirable.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Education</hi></p>
                <p>For many years it has been the policy of the Federal Government to encourage and
                    foster the cause of education. Large sums of money are annually appropriated to
                    carry on vocational training. Many millions go into agricultural schools. The
                    general subject is under the immediate direction of a Commissioner of Education.
                    While this subject is strictly a State and local function, it should continue to
                    have the encouragement of the National Government. I am still of the opinion
                    that much good could be accomplished through the establishment of a Department
                    of Education and Relief, into which would be gathered all of these functions
                    under one directing member of the Cabinet.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Department of Labor</hi></p>
                <p>Industrial relations have never been more peaceful. In recent months they have
                    suffered from only one serious controversy. In all others difficulties have been
                    adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settle controversies by friendly
                    agreement rather than by compulsion. The welfare of women and children is being
                    especially guarded by our Department of Labor. Its Children’s Bureau is in
                    cooperation with 26 State boards and 80 juvenile courts.</p>
                <p>Through its Bureau of Immigration it has been found that medical examination
                    abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much <pb n="XXIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XXIII" facs="0027"/>hardship. Some further legislation to provide
                    for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in this country,
                    and granting more freedom for the migration of the North American Indian tribes
                    is desirable.</p>
                <p>The United States Employment Service has enabled about 2,000,000 men and women to
                    gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. Particular attention has been
                    given to assisting men past middle life and in providing field labor for
                    harvesting agricultural crops. This has been made possible in part through the
                    service of the Federal Board for Vocational Education, which is cooperating with
                    the States in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the
                    wage earner.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Public Buildings</hi></p>
                <p>Construction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for carrying
                    out a public-building program for Washington. We have reached a time when not
                    only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the public buildings of
                    the Capital City should be given much attention. It will be necessary to
                    purchase further land and provide the required continuing appropriations.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Historical Celebrations</hi></p>
                <p>Provision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth
                    of George Washington. Suggestion has been made for the construction of a
                    memorial road leading from the Capital to Mount Vernon, which may well have the
                    consideration of the Congress, and the commission intrusted with preparations
                    for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete
                    writings of Washington and a series of writings by different authors relating to
                    him.</p>
                <p>February 25, 1929, is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the capture of
                    Fort Sackville, at Vincennes, in the State of Indiana. This eventually brought
                    into the Union what was known as the Northwest Territory, embracing the region
                    north of the Ohio River between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi River. This
                    expedition was led by George Rogers Clark. His heroic character and the
                    importance of his victory are too little known and understood. They gave us not
                    only this Northwest Territory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the
                    Pacific. The State of Indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of Fort
                    Sackville as a national shrine. The Federal Government may well make some
                    provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at
                    that point.</p>
                <pb n="XXIV" xml:id="pg_XXIV" facs="0028"/>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Foreign Relations</hi></p>
                <p>It is the policy of the United States to promote peace. We are a peaceful people
                    and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment rather than by
                    force. We have believed that peace can best be secured by a faithful observance
                    on our part of the principles of international law, accompanied by patience and
                    conciliation, and requiring of others a like treatment for ourselves. We have
                    lately had some difference with Mexico relative to the injuries inflicted upon
                    our nationals and their property within that country. A firm adherence to our
                    rights and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of Mexico, both in
                    accordance with the law of nations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it is
                    hoped will resolve all our differences without interfering with the friendly
                    relationship between the two Governments.</p>
                <p>We have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to China to protect the
                    lives and property of our citizens. Fortunately their simple presence there has
                    been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. But there has been
                    considerable loss of property. That unhappy country is torn by factions and
                    revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period. Meanwhile we are
                    protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with any government which
                    may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of China. They have always had
                    our friendship, and they should especially merit our consideration in these days
                    of their distraction and distress.</p>
                <p>We were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in Nicaragua. Our marine
                    and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and prevented a heavy
                    sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion to a state
                    of revolution. Henry L. Stimson, former Secretary of War, was sent there to
                    cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers in effecting a settlement
                    between the contending parties. This was done on the assurance that we would
                    cooperate in restoring a state of peace where our rights would be protected by
                    giving our assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election, which
                    occurs in a few months. With this assurance the population returned to their
                    peace-time pursuits, with the exception of some small roving bands of
                    outlaws.</p>
                <p>In general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improved
                    within the year. While having a due regard for our own affairs, the protection
                    of our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we can afford to be
                    liberal toward others. Our example has become of great importance in the world.
                    It is recognized that we are independent, detached, and can and do take a
                    disinterested position in relation to international affairs. Our charity <pb
                        n="XXV" xml:id="pg_XXV" facs="0029"/>embraces the earth. Our trade is far
                    flung. Our financial favors are widespread. Those who are peaceful and
                    law-abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, but that
                    they can rely on our moral support. Proposals for promoting the peace of the
                    world will have careful consideration. But we are not a people who are always
                    seeking for a sign. We know that peace comes from honesty and fair dealing, from
                    moderation, and a generous regard for the rights of others. The heart of the
                    Nation is more important than treaties. A spirit of generous consideration is a
                    more certain defense than great armaments. We should continue to promote peace
                    by our example, and fortify it by such international covenants against war as we
                    are permitted under our Constitution to make.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">American Progress</hi></p>
                <p>Our country has made much progress. But it has taken, and will continue to take,
                    much effort. Competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishness and
                    arrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weaker peoples
                    will be many. All of these are embraced in the opportunity for true greatness.
                    They will be overbalanced by cooperation, by generosity, and a spirit of
                    neighborly kindness. The forces of the universe are taking humanity in that
                    direction. In doing good, in walking humbly, in sustaining its own people, in
                    ministering to other nations, America will work out its own mighty destiny.</p>

                        <p>24. The Department’s telegram No. 25 will transmit to you the text of a
                            memorandum which you are desired to present on Thursday, February 10, to
                            the Government of France. It is also to be presented to the Governments
                            of Great Britain, Italy, and Japan. The Department will also transmit,
                            in its telegram No. 26, the text of a message which President Coolidge
                            proposes addressing to Congress at noon, Eastern Standard Time, on
                            Thursday, February 10. Since the Department will make public the full
                            text immediately after the message has been delivered to Congress, it is
                            important for advance arrangements to be made by you to deliver to the
                            Foreign Office this memorandum either at 4 o’clock or as close to that
                            hour as possible. It is hoped that you will be able to give both this
                            message and the memorandum the widest publicity. Prior to the delivery
                            of the message, however, there should be no communication to any press
                            representative.</p>

                                    concluded that it can helpfully make certain observations at
                                    this time which, it hopes, may contribute materially to the
                                    success of that Commission—a success earnestly desired by the
                                    Government and people of the United States.</p>
                                <p>The conviction that the competitive augmentation of national
                                    armaments has been one of the principal causes of international
                                    suspicion and ill-will, leading to war, is firmly held by the
                                    American Government and people. Hence, the American Government
                                    has neglected no opportunity to lend its sympathy and support to
                                    international efforts to reduce and limit armaments.</p>
                                <p>The success of the Washington Conference of 1921–22 demonstrated
                                    that other Powers were animated with a similar desire to do away
                                    with this dangerous source of international discord. The
                                    Washington Conference made a beginning, however, and it has been
                                    the continued hope of the American Government, since 1922, that
                                    the task, undertaken at Washington by the group of Naval Powers
                                    could be resumed and completed.</p>
                                <p>For this reason, the American Government was happy to observe
                                    that the efforts looking towards the holding of a general
                                    international conference for the limitation of armament, which
                                    had been in progress for several years under the auspices of the
                                    League of Nations, had reached, in December, 1925, a stage
                                    sufficiently advanced, in the opinion of the Council of the
                                    League of Nations, to warrant the establishment of the
                                    Preparatory Commission, to meet in 1926, to prepare the ground
                                    for an international conference at an early date. The American
                                    Government, pursuant to its policy of cooperation with all
                                    efforts calculated to bring about an actual limitation of
                                    armament, accepted the invitation of the Council to be
                                    represented on the Preparatory Commission. The American
                                    representatives on that Commission have endeavored to play a
                                    helpful part in its discussions, and they will continue to be
                                    guided by that policy.</p>
                                <p>The American Government believes that the discussions of the
                                    Commission have been most valuable in making clear the views of
                                    the various governments as to the problems presented, and in
                                    demonstrating the complexity and diversity of the obstacles to
                                    be overcome in the preparation and conclusion of a general
                                    agreement for the limitation of all armament.</p>
                                <p>At the same time, these very complexities and difficulties, as
                                    brought out in the Preparatory Commission, have clearly pointed
                                    out that a final solution for the problem of armament may not be
                                    immediately practicable. Indeed, at the latest meeting of the
                                    Council of the League of Nations, several distinguished
                                    statesmen, leaders in the movement for the limitation of
                                    armament, sounded a note of warning against too great optimism
                                    of immediate success.</p>
                                <p>The American Government is most anxious that concrete results in
                                    the limitation of armament may be achieved. The discussions of
                                    the Preparatory Commission have emphasized the fact that a
                                    number of governments consider that one of the chief present
                                    obstacles to <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0089"/>the general
                                    reduction and limitation of armaments lies in the
                                    interdependence of land, sea, and air armaments, and in the
                                    consequent impossibility of reducing or limiting one of these
                                    categories without dealing simultaneously with the others. On
                                    the other hand, the discussions have demonstrated even more
                                    emphatically that, should all effort to bring about the
                                    reduction or limitation of armament be conditioned upon the
                                    acceptance by all the world of a comprehensive plan covering all
                                    classes and types of armament, there would be little, if any,
                                    prospect of actual progress towards arms limitation in the near
                                    future.</p>
                                <p>The above difficulties must be frankly recognized. The American
                                    Government believes that they can be overcome and that they must
                                    be overcome, since the consequences of a failure to overcome
                                    them, and to make some definite, if only partial, agreement for
                                    the limitation of armament, would constitute a setback to the
                                    cause of international peace too great to deserve serious
                                    contemplation as a possibility.</p>
                                <p>Admitting reluctantly that the existing political situations in
                                    certain parts of the world may render the problem of universal
                                    limitation incapable of immediate solution as a whole, the
                                    American Government believes that it is entirely practicable for
                                    the nations of the world to proceed at once to the isolation and
                                    separate solution of such problems as may appear susceptible of
                                    such treatment, meanwhile continuing to give sympathetic
                                    consideration and discussion to comprehensive proposals aimed at
                                    the simultaneous limitation of land, sea, and air armaments by a
                                    general agreement when such an agreement may be warranted by
                                    existing world conditions. The American Government believes that
                                    the adoption of such a course is the duty of the governments
                                    represented on the Preparatory Commission, and that by so doing,
                                    they will ensure the achievement by the Commission and by the
                                    general conference of concrete, even though perhaps only partial
                                    results, thus facilitating progress towards the final solution
                                    of the general problem.</p>
                                <p>The American Government, as its representatives on the
                                    Preparatory Commission have repeatedly stated, feels that land
                                    and air armaments constitute essentially regional problems to be
                                    solved primarily by regional agreements. The American army and
                                    air force are at minimum strength. Agreement for land and air
                                    limitation in other regions of the world would not be dependent
                                    upon the reduction or limitation of American land and air
                                    forces. Therefore, the American Government does not feel that it
                                    can appropriately offer definite suggestions to other powers in
                                    regard to the limitation of these categories of armament.</p>
                                <p>The problem of the limitation of naval armament, while not
                                    regional in character, can be dealt with as a practical matter
                                    by measures affecting the navies of a limited group of Powers.
                                    This has been clearly established by the success of the
                                    Washington Treaty Limiting Naval Armament.<note n="5"

                                    agreement.</p>
                                <p>The discussions over a period of six months in Geneva have been
                                    most useful in the opportunity afforded for an exchange of views
                                    as to the general problem of naval limitation and on the basis
                                    of these discussions it is felt that there is a possibility of
                                    reconciling many of the divergent views which have been
                                    expressed, in such a manner as to meet the requirements of the
                                    Naval Powers and enable them to decide upon acceptable measures
                                    of limitation.</p>
                                <p>In order to advance definitely towards a limitation agreement,
                                    the Government of the United States takes this method of
                                    addressing an inquiry to the Governments Signatories of the
                                    Washington Treaty Limiting Naval Armament as to whether they are
                                    disposed to empower their representatives at the forthcoming
                                    meeting of the Preparatory Commission to initiate negotiations
                                    looking towards an agreement providing for limitation in the
                                    classes of Naval vessels not covered by the Washington
                                    Treaty.</p>
                                <p>The American Government is not unmindful of the fact that the
                                    Preparatory Commission is not specifically charged with the duty
                                    of concluding international agreements, and that its task is
                                    primarily that of preparing the agenda for a conference to be
                                    called at a later date. Nevertheless, being sincerely desirous
                                    of the success of the Preparatory Commission, the American
                                    Government makes this suggestion in the firm belief that the
                                    conclusion at Geneva, as soon as possible, among the Powers
                                    Signatories of the Washington Treaty, of an agreement for
                                    further naval limitation, far from interfering with or
                                    detracting from the success of the Preparatory Commission’s
                                    aims, would constitute a valuable contribution to the sum of
                                    achievement attributable to that Commission and would facilitate
                                    the task of the final Conference in dealing with the
                                    particularly complex problems of land and air armament, perhaps
                                    capable of solution for the present only by regional limitation
                                    agreements.</p>
                                <p>It seems probable that, under any circumstances, the final
                                    Conference will not be able to meet during this calendar year.
                                    The coming into effect of agreements reached by it might be
                                    delayed for a considerable period, for a multitude of causes.
                                    Therefore, the American Government believes that those Powers
                                    which may be able to arrive at an agreement for further naval
                                    limitation at an earlier date would not be justified in
                                    consciously postponing that agreement, and thereby opening the
                                    way for a recrudescence of a spirit of competitive naval
                                    building—a development greatly to be deplored by all governments
                                    and peoples.</p>
                                <p>The American Government feels that the general principles of the
                                    Washington Treaty offer a suitable basis for further discussion
                                    among its signatories.</p>
                                <p>Although hesitating at this time to put forward rigid proposals
                                    as regards the ratios of naval strength to be maintained by the
                                    different Powers, the American Government, for its part, is
                                    disposed to accept, in regard to those classes of vessels not
                                    covered by the Washington Treaty, an extension of the 5–5–3
                                    ratio as regards the United States, Great Britain and Japan, and
                                    to leave to discussion at Geneva the <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5"
                                        facs="0091"/>ratios of France and Italy, taking into full
                                    account their special conditions and requirements in regard to
                                    the types of vessels in question. Ratios for capital ships and
                                    aircraft carriers were established by that Treaty which would
                                    not be affected in any way by an agreement covering other
                                    classes of ships.</p>
                                <p>The American representatives at the forthcoming meeting at Geneva
                                    will, of course, participate fully in the discussions looking to
                                    the preparation of an agenda for a final general conference for
                                    the limitation of armament. In addition, they will have full
                                    powers to negotiate definitely regarding measures for further
                                    naval limitation, and, if they are able to reach agreement with
                                    the representatives of the other signatories of the Washington
                                    Treaty, to conclude a convention embodying such agreement, in
                                    tentative or final form, as may be found practicable.</p>
                                <p>The American Government earnestly hopes that the institution of
                                    such negotiations at Geneva may be agreeable to the Governments
                                    of the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan, and that
                                    comprehensive limitation of all types of naval armament may be
                                    brought into effect among the principal naval powers without
                                    delay.</p>

                            when you present the memorandum to the Japanese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, that you orally point out to him that the plan is believed to
                            be in thorough accord with the Japanese Government’s desire for further
                            limitation of naval armament, that already there exists between the two
                            Governments a substantial agreement in essentials, that even in minor
                            matters between the United States and Japan there appears to be no
                            conflict of opinion or interest, and that any minor differences can
                            readily be adjusted.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has avoided proposing in this memorandum any
                            detailed plan because of the belief that representatives of the
                            interested Governments can find an acceptable solution of their naval
                            problems the more easily if they remain at liberty to explore as fully
                            as possible and are not limited by rigid instructions from which
                            receding would be difficult.</p>
                        <p>Acceptance by the Japanese Government of this proposal would particularly
                            gratify the United States Government.</p>

                        <p>You should add that this Government believes the negotiations
                            contemplated by its memorandum, while not necessarily beginning on the
                            date of the Preparatory Commission’s convening, should be commenced as
                            soon thereafter as may be generally agreeable to the five interested
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>You should say further that President Coolidge for some time has
                            considered this matter to be urgent, but, since he did not wish to draw
                            the Japanese Government’s attention to so important a question prior to
                            the impending funeral ceremonies of the late Emperor, he withheld
                            action, both in Tokyo and other capitals, until the conclusion of the
                            funeral ceremonies.</p>

                            action in regard to which is outlined in Department’s Nos. 24, 25 and
                            27: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to my instructions
                                    the American Ambassadors at London, Paris, Rome, and Tokyo, will
                                    today present to the Governments of Great Britain, France,
                                    Italy, and Japan, a Memorandum suggesting that they empower
                                    their delegates at the forthcoming meeting of the Preparatory
                                    Commission for the Disarmament Conference at Geneva to negotiate
                                    and conclude at an early date an agreement further limiting
                                    naval armament, supplementing the Washington Treaty on that
                                    subject, and covering the classes of vessels not covered by that
                                    Treaty. I transmit herewith, for the information of the
                                    Congress, a copy of this Memorandum.</p>
                                <p>I wish to inform the Congress of the considerations which have
                                    moved me to take this action.</p>
                                <p>The support of all measures looking to the preservation of the
                                    peace of the world has been long established as a fundamental
                                    policy of this Government. The American Government and people
                                    are convinced that competitive armaments constitute one of the
                                    most dangerous contributing causes of international suspicion
                                    and discord and are calculated eventually to lead to war. A
                                    recognition of this fact and a desire as far as possible to
                                    remove this danger led the American Government in 1921 to call
                                    the Washington Conference.</p>
                                <p>At that time we were engaged in a great building program which,
                                    upon its completion, would have given us first place on the sea.
                                    We felt then, however, and feel now, that the policy we then
                                        advocated—<pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0093"/>that of
                                    deliberate self-denial and limitation of naval armament by the
                                    Great Naval Powers—promised the attainment of at least one
                                    guarantee of peace, an end worthy of mutual adjustment and
                                    concession.</p>
                                <p>At the Washington Conference we found the other nations animated
                                    with the same desire as ourselves to remove naval competition
                                    from the list of possible causes of international discord.
                                    Unfortunately, however, it was not possible to reach agreements
                                    at Washington covering all classes of naval ships. The
                                    Washington Treaty provided a specific tonnage limitation upon
                                    capital ships and aircraft carriers, with certain restrictions
                                    as to size and maximum caliber of guns for other vessels. Every
                                    nation has been at complete liberty to build any number of
                                    cruisers, destroyers and submarines. Only size and armament of
                                    cruisers were limited. The Signatories of the Washington Treaty
                                    have fulfilled their obligations faithfully and there can be no
                                    doubt that that Treaty constitutes an outstanding success in its
                                    operation.</p>
                                <p>It has been the hope of the American Government, constantly
                                    expressed by the Congress since the Washington Conference, that
                                    a favorable opportunity might present itself to complete the
                                    work begun here by the conclusion of further agreements covering
                                    cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The desirability of such
                                    an agreement has been apparent, since it was only to be expected
                                    that the spirit of competition, stifled as regards capital ships
                                    and aircraft carriers by the Washington Treaty, would, sooner or
                                    later, show itself with regard to the other vessels not limited
                                    under the Treaty. Actually, I do not believe that competitive
                                    building of these classes of ships has begun. Nevertheless,
                                    far-reaching building programs have been laid down by certain
                                    Powers and there has appeared in our own country, as well as
                                    abroad, a sentiment urging naval construction on the ground that
                                    such construction is taking place elsewhere. In such sentiments
                                    lies the germ of renewed naval competition. I am sure that all
                                    governments and all peoples would choose a system of naval
                                    limitation in preference to consciously reverting to competitive
                                    building. Therefore, in the hope of bringing about an
                                    opportunity for discussion among the principal naval Powers to
                                    ascertain whether further limitation is practicable, I have
                                    suggested to them that negotiations on this subject should begin
                                    as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>The moment seems particularly opportune to try to secure further
                                    limitation of armament in accordance with the expressed will of
                                    the Congress. The earnest desire of the nations of the world to
                                    relieve themselves in as great a measure as possible of the
                                    burden of armaments and to avoid the dangers of competition has
                                    been shown by the establishment of the Preparatory Commission
                                    for the Disarmament Conference, which met in Geneva last May,
                                    and which is continuing its work with a view to preparing the
                                    agenda for a final general conference. For more than six months,
                                    representatives of a score or more of nations have examined from
                                    all points of view the problem of the reduction and limitation
                                    of armaments. In these discussions it was brought out very
                                    clearly that a number of nations felt that land, sea, and air
                                    armaments were interdependent and that <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8"
                                        facs="0094"/>it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
                                    agree upon the limitation of one type of armament without
                                    simultaneously limiting the other types. The consequence to be
                                    feared is that a deadlock will be reached, should even partial
                                    progress in the reduction of armaments be conditioned upon the
                                    acceptance of some universal plan covering land, sea, and air
                                    forces together. If the prospective deadlock cannot be broken,
                                    it is probable that little progress will be made for the time
                                    being. It appears to me to be the duty of this Government, which
                                    has always advocated limitation of armaments, to endeavor to
                                    suggest some avenue by which concrete results may be achieved
                                    even though such results may be short of an ultimate ideal
                                    solution for the threefold problem of land, sea, and air
                                    armament.</p>
                                <p>Our delegates at Geneva have consistently expressed the view that
                                    under conditions as they exist in the world today the problems
                                    of land and air armaments are most susceptible of solution by
                                    regional agreements covering regions within which the land or
                                    air armaments of one country could constitute a potential threat
                                    to another country. Geographical continents have been suggested
                                    as regions appropriate for land and air limitation
                                    agreements.</p>
                                <p>The American land and air force constitute a threat to no one.
                                    They are at minimum strength; their reduction has been suggested
                                    by no one as a necessary condition precedent to general arms
                                    limitation. This reduction of our land forces has been rendered
                                    possible by our favored geographical position. I realize that
                                    the problems of armaments on land and in the air in Europe are
                                    beset with difficulties which in all justice we must recognize
                                    and, although this Government will always be ready to lend its
                                    assistance in any appropriate way to efforts on the part of
                                    European or other Governments to arrive at regional agreements
                                    limiting land and air forces, it would hesitate to make specific
                                    proposals on this subject to European nations.</p>
                                <p>The problem of the limitation of naval armament, while not
                                    regional in character or susceptible of regional treatment, has
                                    been successfully treated, in part, by an agreement among the
                                    five leading Naval Powers, and, in my opinion, can be definitely
                                    dealt with by further agreements among those Powers.</p>
                                <p>It will be a contribution to the success of the preliminary work
                                    now going on at Geneva should the Great Naval Powers there agree
                                    upon a further definite limitation of naval armament.</p>
                                <p>It is my intention that the American representatives at Geneva
                                    should continue to discuss with the representatives of the other
                                    nations there the program for a general limitation of armaments
                                    conference. If such a conference should be possible in the
                                    future, on a basis generally acceptable, this Government would,
                                    of course, be highly gratified. Pending the formulation of the
                                    plan for such a general conference, however, I believe that we
                                    should make an immediate and sincere effort to solve the problem
                                    of naval limitation, the solution of which would do much to make
                                    the efforts toward more general limitation successful.</p>

                        <p>27. Referring to Department’s telegram 25. The Department desires that,
                            in presenting its memorandum to the French Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            you impress on him that this Government has tried to formulate its
                            proposals in such a way as to make them acceptable to the Government of
                            France. You should point out especially that the United States
                            Government has avoided proposing any detailed plan in the memorandum,
                            because it does not wish to preclude free discussion later of any such
                            detailed plans which the French Government might be inclined to bring
                            forward in its own interest. The French Government’s often-expressed
                            desire to bring about an early limitation of armament has impressed the
                            United States Government by its sincerity. The difficulties of treating
                            with three categories of armament simultaneously are, on the other hand,
                            so great as to cause serious apprehension lest a deadlock prevent any
                            real progress in the direction of the common goal. These proposals have
                            been made by the United States Government in the hope that such an
                            unfortunate conclusion of the Preparatory Commission’s labors may be
                            avoided. The earnest hope of the United States Government should be
                            expressed to the Foreign Minister that his Government will agree
                            respecting the desirability of a special effort being made to accomplish
                            at least one type of limitation, thereby contributing to the Preparatory
                            Commission’s work and facilitating the task of the final Conference, in
                            the calling of which the Government of France has taken the lead. As
                            your personal opinion, you may have the chance to point out that the
                            French Government’s unconditional acceptance of this American proposal
                            would very happily affect public opinion in this country.</p>
                        <p>You should add that the United States Government believes the
                            negotiations contemplated by its memorandum, while not necessarily
                            beginning on the date of the Preparatory Commission’s convening, should
                            be started at the earliest possible date thereafter as generally
                            agreeable to the five interested Governments.</p>

                            wishes as a matter of courtesy that the Government of Chile have the

                                    signatories of the naval convention of Washington of 1922 and,
                                    as one of them, to the French Government, a memorandum proposing
                                    to negotiate at Geneva between the five powers, without
                                    disinteresting themselves from the general work of the reduction
                                    of armaments carried on for the last 10 months by the
                                    Preparatory Commission on Disarmament, an agreement with a view
                                    to limiting from now on naval armament for the categories of
                                    vessels which are not included in the treaty of Washington.</p>
                                <p>The French Government wishes first of all to say how much it
                                    appreciates the lofty aim of the American note. The generous
                                    idealism which inspires it is in accordance with its own views.
                                    No power could be more appreciative of the noble initiative of
                                    President Coolidge than France which never ceases to give proofs
                                    of her resolutely pacific will.</p>
                                <p>It desires equally to show how much it has appreciated the
                                    friendly attention of the Federal Government in leaving its
                                    proposals flexible in an endeavor to take into account the
                                    special conditions and requirements of the continental powers.
                                    The American Government has thus shown that it is quite aware of
                                    the very clear position taken by the French Government in the
                                    question of naval disarmament. It will <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11"
                                        facs="0097"/>therefore not be astonished to see French
                                    opinion preoccupied with its duties as a member of the League of
                                    Nations and with its moral obligations towards all the powers
                                    which form part of it.</p>
                                <p>On its part the Government of the Republic would have been happy
                                    to be able to adhere to these proposals without reserve and the
                                    entire French nation would have congratulated itself on seeing
                                    the two countries again associated in an enterprise so
                                    consistent with their common traditions. But an attentive study
                                    of the American proposals has convinced the Government of the
                                    Republic that in their present form they risk compromising the
                                    success of the task already commenced at Geneva with the active
                                    help of the representatives of the American Government.</p>
                                <p>Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations has made the
                                    general limitation of armaments one of the essential duties of
                                    the League. Without doubt in 1921 the powers to whom the United
                                    States are today appealing already united their efforts to
                                    realize by themselves a limitation of naval armaments. At the
                                    time it took place the calling of the Washington Conference was
                                    fully justified, but circumstances today are different. The
                                    League of Nations has begun its task: the conclusion of an arms
                                    traffic convention, the elaboration of a convention on the
                                    private manufacture of war materials, the convocation, finally,
                                    of a Preparatory Commission with a view to the meeting of a
                                    Conference for the General Limitation of Armaments, a commission
                                    to which all the countries of the world have been invited and in
                                    which the greater part of them participate, mark so many
                                    decisive stages towards the aim fixed by the Covenant. Without
                                    doubt the American Government is not thinking of withdrawing
                                    from the task undertaken the efficient collaboration which for
                                    nearly a year its delegates have contributed; it promises, on
                                    the contrary, to continue it. But its proposal has nevertheless
                                    for practical result to divest the Preparatory Commission of an
                                    essential question which figures on its program; to constitute,
                                    on the side, a special Conference in which only a few powers
                                    should participate and whose decisions, under penalty of being
                                    vain, must at least in their principles be later recognized as
                                    valid by powers which would not have been admitted to discuss
                                    them.</p>
                                <p>To decide today, without consulting the League of Nations, [a
                                    change of] method and to seek a partial solution of the problem,
                                    in preoccupying one’s self with maintaining the actual existing
                                    situation [rather] than in determining the conditions proper to
                                    ensure the security of each one, to limit communicating,
                                    [besides,] this effort to a few powers, would be both to weaken
                                    the authority of the League of Nations so essential to the peace
                                    of the world and to injure the principle of the equality of
                                    States which is at the very base of the Covenant of Geneva and
                                    to which on its part the French Government remains firmly
                                    attached.</p>
                                <p>The principle of the equality of the powers, great or small, is
                                    one of the recognized rules of the League of Nations. Technical
                                    committees have met; all the maritime powers have participated
                                    in their labors; they have pointed out the necessities for their
                                    defense. How could one admit that at the moment when the
                                    Preparatory Commission is called upon to formulate the
                                    conclusion of its discussions the five most important maritime
                                    powers should take cognizance of the question and as far as it
                                    concerns them give it a definitive solution <pb n="12"
                                        xml:id="pg_12" facs="0098"/>of a nature to prejudice the
                                    final decisions for the entire naval problems?</p>
                                <p>In fact, besides, the categories to which the new limitation
                                    should apply are those which for the majority of powers present
                                    the greatest interest. An agreement limited to a few navies
                                    could be explained for battleships; practically, they are the
                                    only ones to possess any. It is otherwise when the question of
                                    light vessels is considered. All the navies of the world have an
                                    interest in being associated with the deliberations on this
                                    important problem.</p>
                                <p>As for the French Government, which in the question of limitation
                                    of armaments is only interested from the defensive point of
                                    view, as Mr. Briand declared to Mr. Hughes on December 18,
                                        1921,<note n="11" xml:id="d7fn11"><ref

                                    respect must interest itself both in the protection of its
                                    coasts and in the safety of its maritime communications, its
                                    delegates at Geneva have defended and caused to prevail in the
                                    technical commissions two general principles: On the one hand,
                                    that one cannot undertake to limit naval armaments without
                                    taking into consideration the solutions proposed for land and
                                    air armaments; on the other hand, especially from the naval
                                    point of view, that the limitation of armaments can only result
                                    from the attribution to any one [<hi rend="italic">each</hi>]
                                    power of a global tonnage that it remains free to divide
                                    according to the sense of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] its
                                    necessities.</p>
                                <p>The American proposal sets aside immediately these two principles
                                    which would have for consequence that the French Government,
                                    which has taken its stand before all the nations represented at
                                    Geneva, could only adopt it by abandonment its point of view. It
                                    would thus contradict itself while publicly recanting.</p>
                                <p>The method proposed: Would it be at least of a kind to obtain the
                                    looked-for result? The precedent of the Rome Conference in 1924
                                    does not permit of hoping so. This Conference in fact did not
                                    succeed in having adopted by the powers not represented at
                                    Washington the principles which there had been established for
                                    battleships, still less in having them extended to the other
                                    categories of vessels. These powers would not be less mindful of
                                    their own interests the day that they were asked again to accept
                                    principles resulting from decisions which would have been
                                    decided upon without them.</p>
                                <p>This last objection has without doubt been considered by the
                                    American Government and if it has thought necessary to set it
                                    aside it is by reason of its opinion that if the problems of
                                    disarmament are not disassociated there is no hope for a
                                    practical result in the near future. The French Government
                                    thinks on the contrary that in the present state of the surveys
                                    with which the Preparatory Commission is charged the latter can,
                                    at its next session and on condition that the nations
                                    represented bring like itself a firm resolve to succeed, make
                                    the decisions which would permit the meeting, with serious [<hi
                                        rend="italic">good?</hi>] chances of success, of the general
                                    Conference on disarmament.</p>
                                <p>The French Government having envisaged the different aspects of
                                    the American proposal, conscious of the duties imposed on it as
                                    a member of the League of Nations, fearing any undermining [of]
                                    the authority of the latter, and convinced that no durable work
                                    of peace can be built without the common consent of all the
                                    powers called, on the same grounds, to defend their rights and
                                    interests, thinks that <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0099"/>it
                                    is at Geneva and by the Preparatory Commission itself, in which

                                    participate, that the American proposal can be effectually

                        <p>The Japanese Government fully share with the American Government the
                            views expressed in that Memorandum on the desirability of an agreement
                            calculated to complete the work of the Washington Conference. They
                            cordially welcome the initiative taken by the American Government for
                            the institution among the five Powers of negotiations looking to such
                            desirable end. They will be happy to take part in those negotiations
                            through their representatives invested with full powers to negotiate and
                            to conclude an agreement on the subject.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the supreme importance of the problem to be
                            discussed and determined, the Japanese Government find it essential that
                            at least a part of the Japanese Delegation shall be specially sent from
                            Tokyo. Considering the length of time required for the necessary
                            preparations, as well as for the journey from Tokyo to Geneva, it will
                            obviously be impossible for the Japanese representatives to assist at
                            the negotiations, should that meeting be held simultaneously with or
                            immediately after the forthcoming session of the Preparatory Disarmament
                            Commission, which is scheduled to be opened on March 21 next.
                            Accordingly, the Japanese Government desire that the meeting of the
                            Powers Signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty, now suggested, shall
                            take place on a date not earlier than June 1.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government are further gratified to learn that it is not the
                            intention of the American Government at this time to put forward rigid
                            proposals on the ratios of naval strength to be <pb n="14"
                                xml:id="pg_14" facs="0100"/>maintained by the several Powers in the
                            classes of vessels not covered by the Washington Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure the success of the proposed negotiations, it seems
                            highly important that in the matter of these conditions of the
                            limitation of armament, all parties to the negotiations should approach
                            the subject with an open mind, being always guided by the spirit of
                            mutual accommodation and helpfulness consistently with the defensive
                            requirements of each nation.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government confidently hope that an adjustment will be
                            reached in a manner fair and satisfactory to each of the participating
                            Powers and conducive to the general peace and security of the world.</p>

                        <p>24. At noon today reply of Italian Government, stating that to its regret
                            it cannot accede to proposal contained in our memorandum of February 10,
                            was handed to me. Text will be given press here 10 p.m. today. Italian
                            Ambassador in Washington has been instructed to give verbal explanation
                            of reasons which underlie Italy’s action.</p>
                        <p>I was told that if the President could arrange to have the great powers
                            agree in advance that French-Italian parity established at Washington
                            Conference on Limitation of Armament should be accepted and if provision
                            were made that the minor Mediterranean powers and Russia should not
                            disturb balance of naval power in Mediterranean, Italy would be disposed
                            to reconsider her decision and to agree to attend Conference. I
                            understand that the Ambassador is being instructed to explain this
                            suggestion also.</p>

                        <p>25. The following is a translation of the reply of the Italian Government
                            to my memorandum of February 10th: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Italian Government has submitted to serious examination the
                                    memorandum handed on February 10th instant by the Ambassador of
                                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0101"/>the United States of
                                    America to the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                                <p>The said memorandum explains the principles which have inspired
                                    the Washington Government in proposing that, before the
                                    contemplated International Conference for the Reduction and the
                                    Limitation of Armaments, negotiations be initiated between the
                                    five powers signatory to the treaty of Washington of 1922 for
                                    the purpose of studying the limitation of certain categories of
                                    naval armaments not covered by said treaty.</p>
                                <p>The Italian Government appreciates fully the high spirit which
                                    has guided the President of the United States of America in
                                    addressing his message to Congress on the same day in which the
                                    memorandum of the American Government was handed to the
                                    Governments of the great powers interested. The appreciation of
                                    the Italian Government has all the greater value since Italy has
                                    always associated herself with every international activity
                                    tending to establish upon a solid base the tranquillity and
                                    peace of the world.</p>
                                <p>That spirit which has guided Mr. Coolidge is, so to say, the
                                    heritage of the Italian Government and people.</p>
                                <p>Italy in fact has not only adhered to the Washington Conference
                                    but has concluded during the past 5 years more treaties of
                                    friendship and arbitration than those stipulated by any other
                                    European state. Pier actual military expenses and, above all,
                                    her naval budget in which there is appropriated 300 million lire
                                    annually equal to about 13 millions of dollars for new naval
                                    construction, demonstrate clearly that the ‘far-reaching
                                    building programs’ alleged in the message certainly cannot refer
                                    to Italy.</p>
                                <p>The American Government proposes in its memorandum that the
                                    Italian Government empower its representative on the Preparatory
                                    Disarmament Commission to initiate negotiations at Geneva with a
                                    view to concluding agreements which, in anticipation of a global
                                    limitation of naval, land and air armaments, shall regulate
                                    naval armaments, by limiting the construction of those lesser
                                    vessels which were not contemplated in the accords of 1922.</p>
                                <p>As regards such a proposal the Government of His Majesty must
                                    above all state that, in principle and as far as concerns the
                                    continent of Europe, its point of view is that there exists an
                                    undeniable interdependence of every type of armament of every
                                    single power, and furthermore that it is not possible to adopt
                                    partial measures between only the five large naval powers.</p>
                                <p>The Italian Government thinks that the limitation of armaments,
                                    to be efficacious to the ends referred to by Mr. Coolidge,
                                    should be universal and recalls in this connection that the
                                    example of Washington was not accepted by the minor naval powers
                                    and that the Conference held at Rome in February 1924 for the
                                    extension of the principles of the Washington treaty to the
                                    powers not signatory thereto was a failure.</p>
                                <p>Then, as concerns Italy more specifically, the Italian Government
                                    believes it can invoke the same geographical reasons referred to
                                    in the message of President Coolidge. If the United States, by
                                    reason of their geographical position (‘our favored geographical
                                    position’) has been able to reduce land armament to the minimum,
                                    Italy by reason of its unfavorable geographical position cannot
                                    expose itself without <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0102"
                                    />grave risks to a binding limitation of its maritime armaments,
                                    which are already insufficient to the needs of its defense.</p>
                                <p>Italy has, in fact, only three lines of communication with the
                                    rest of the world, three obligatory routes, through Suez,
                                    Gibraltar, and the Dardanelles, for provisioning itself.</p>
                                <p>Italy has an enormous coast development with populous cities and
                                    vital centers on the coast or a short distance from it, with two
                                    large islands, besides the Dodecanese, all of which are linked
                                    to the peninsula by lines of vital traffic.</p>
                                <p>Italy has four important colonies to protect, two of which are
                                    beyond the Suez Canal.</p>
                                <p>In fact, Italy must also consider the other nations which face on
                                    or can appear in the Mediterranean, particularly favored by
                                    their geographical position amid essential lines of
                                    communication, and which have under construction many units of
                                    various types or are elaborating naval programs of great
                                    strength.</p>
                                <p>For the reasons above stated the Government of His Majesty feels
                                    confident that the Government of the United States will take
                                    into account the reason why Italy cannot, to its regret, accede
                                    to the proposal contained in the memorandum of February
                                    10th.”</p>

                        <p>26. My 24, February 21. In handing me the Italian reply this morning and
                            speaking for Mussolini, Under Secretary Grandi sought to impress upon me
                            that Italo-French relations are extremely delicate. This was also
                            referred to by Mussolini when I presented our memorandum, as I
                            telegraphed. Unless and until Italo-French relations improve, it is
                            evident that no effective steps can be taken in the Mediterranean toward
                            limiting naval armaments.</p>
                        <p>Italy, according to Grandi, believes France will agree to extension to
                            lesser craft of the Italo-French parity established at Washington and
                            Italy, therefore, does not wish to risk the loss, at a new Conference,
                            of the moral prestige and advantage gained at Washington. This explains
                            the naive suggestion which the Italian Ambassador at Washington has been
                            instructed to make to you.<note n="12" xml:id="d11fn12">See memorandum

                        <p>39. The following telegram has just been received from Rome:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of telegram No. 24, printed on <ref
                                target="#pg_14">page 14</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>Sir Esme Howard advised the Department today that British reply would be
                            delayed several days by reason of necessity of consulting Dominions, but
                            that our proposal was being given most sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>The press reports from London indicate that both Baldwin and
                                Chamberlain<note n="13" xml:id="d12fn13">Rt. Hon. Stanley Baldwin,
                                British Prime Minister; and Sir Austen Chamberlain, British
                                Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> favor acceptance but
                            that Bridgeman<note n="14" xml:id="d12fn14">Rt. Hon. W. C. Bridgeman,
                                First Lord of the British Admiralty.</note> favors a flat rejection.
                            If through any misunderstanding the British Government should decline to
                            participate in the suggested discussions, it would be most unfortunate.
                            Only reason for a British refusal would appear to be fear that this
                            Government would fail, in the forthcoming discussions, to take into full
                            consideration special position of British Navy in regard to the French
                            and Italian naval building programs. Unless you deem the action unwise,
                            I should like you to find immediate opportunity to talk matter over with
                            Chamberlain personally. If you do, you should point out to the Foreign
                            Secretary that the President has no idea of making rigid proposals or of
                            failing to take into consideration special interests of any country.
                            Primary object of his suggestion is to endeavor in consultation with
                            other great naval powers to find some means for removing danger of
                            competitive naval building. You will recall that there was no reference
                            to reduction of naval armament in either the memorandum or the
                            President’s message to Congress. Limitation is what is sought. Should
                            reductions in any dass prove to be possible they would be welcome, but
                            reduction would not be essential to success of type of agreement which
                            President hopes can be formulated after full discussions among the
                            representatives of the naval powers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Secretary</hi>: The Italian Ambassador came to
                            my house this afternoon to read me two telegrams from Mussolini with
                            regard to <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0104"/>the Italian answer to
                            the Memorandum on naval limitation. In these telegrams Mussolini
                            instructed the Ambassador to see to it that the Italian answer did not
                            create any talk in this country as to Italian militarism. He said that
                            the whole world should understand that Italy was the most peaceful and
                            peace-loving of nations. He said that the only reason that it was
                            impossible to give an affirmative answer was that, although the
                            situation between France and Italy was better than it had been it was
                            still delicate and that Italy feared the bad feeling which might be
                            aroused by a discussion between the two countries on the question of a
                            parity between the two navies. Mussolini wanted us to understand,
                            therefore, that if Italy could be assured in advance that this question
                            would not be discussed, that the parity established at the Washington
                            Conference would certainly be extended to the smaller ships, he would be
                            very glad to re-examine the invitation of the United States in a most
                            friendly spirit.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that it seemed to me that it was exactly this kind
                            of question that must be examined by the Conference, that the United
                            States alone could not determine it any more than we could say that the
                            other ratios of the Washington Conference must be considered final when
                            applied to a smaller type of vessel. I said that you perfectly
                            understood that particular nations had particular necessities and that
                            for this very reason the invitation had been made very general. I told
                            him that the insistence of Italy in the note that she, at least, had no
                            extensive naval program was naturally accepted but that the later
                            statement that other nations had such programs was the best reason in
                            the world why Italy should have accepted the invitation. The Ambassador
                            said that the reference was to France and Jugoslavia. I answered that I
                            took this for granted, that the conference would have restrained any too
                            great zeal on the part of France, in that it would have put an end to
                            competition; that so far as Jugoslavia was concerned I did not think the
                            country was in any condition financially to proceed with any large naval
                            program but that there would certainly be no incentive to push such a
                            program if Italy had obligated itself to build no gigantic fleet. He
                            said that this was possible but that if, in spite of an agreement
                            between Italy and France and the others the Jugoslavs still persisted it
                            would be very disagreeable. I told him that we knew as well as anyone
                            that circumstances change with the years and that no agreement was so
                            fixed that the powers making it could not get together again for
                            reconsideration, that in the meantime the result would certainly be the
                            cessation of a silly and costly competition.</p>
                        <p>It is perfectly clear to me that the Ambassador agrees with us and not
                            with his Government. He took notes of what I said and will <pb n="19"
                                xml:id="pg_19" facs="0105"/>cable Rome. He said the papers today had
                            been inclined to blame the Italian stand and agreed with me that this
                            was to have been expected. He said as he left that he hoped our answer
                            might enable Rome to reconsider the question.</p>

                        <p>7. Reference Department’s No. 5, February 7, 1 p.m. The Department has
                            received with surprise a “reply” from the Government of Argentina
                            regarding the memorandum which the American Chargé delivered to it on
                            February 10. The purpose of furnishing copies to the Governments of
                            Argentina, Brazil, and Chile was, as you know, merely to keep them
                            informed of events as a courtesy and no replies were expected.</p>
                        <p>If you deem it expedient and if a suitable occasion should present
                            itself, you may advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Argentine
                            reply appears to have been occasioned by some misunderstanding either on
                            part of American Embassy or of Government of Argentina, and that the
                            Government of the United States is not expecting replies from the
                            Governments of either Brazil or Chile unless these Governments
                            particularly wish to make comments.</p>
                        <p>You will not discuss this matter with any representatives of the
                            press.</p>

                        <p>46. Department’s No. 39, February 21, 6 p.m. This morning I happened to
                            meet Bridgeman and told him that the American press, in part at least,
                            had stated that he was against acceptance of our invitation to Naval
                            Conference. He replied that it was a “damned lie” and hoped that I would
                            take occasion to have that fact known at home. He then went on to say
                            that he had all along been in favor of a conference; in fact, if the
                            President had not called one, he, Bridgeman, was preparing to have one
                            called.</p>
                        <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0107"/>
                        <p>He asked me if I thought that the President had in mind a conference open
                            for free discussion and I replied that that was my belief. He then said
                            that it was essential. He concluded our talk by saying that I must be
                            aware that the delay in the British reply arose from the necessity of
                            consulting the Dominions; while he did not commit himself he indicated
                            that a favorable reply was assured.</p>

                                Ambassador in Italy, <ref target="#pg_14">p. 14</ref>.</note>
                            declining to accept our proposal for a discussion at Geneva of naval
                            armament limitation and read to me portions of two telegrams which he
                            had received from Mussolini to the effect that if this Government would
                            agree to “appuyer” the thesis of parity between Italy and France he,
                            Mussolini, would re-examine our proposal. I said to the Ambassador that
                            it was obviously out of the question for us to do anything of this kind,
                            as we had very carefully abstained in our note from making any concrete
                            suggestions concerning the relative positions of Italy and France which
                            might give offense to one or the other and for that very reason we had
                            left the matter entirely open and unprejudiced for discussion at the
                            conference table, I said that we recognized Italy’s particular
                            geographic situation and that this was another reason for our avoiding
                            any concrete proposals which might prejudice the case in advance. The
                            Ambassador then asked me to comment on the phrase “far-reaching building
                            programs” and asserted that this could not be taken to apply to Italy
                            which had embarked on no such program. I replied that the phrase was not
                            intended to apply to any individual country, but was used in a general
                            sense. The Ambassador then said that he had been instructed by Mussolini
                            to endeavor to avoid any comment in the American press concerning
                            Italian militarism and he asked me if I could not say a word to the
                            press correspondents to the effect that Italy was not a militaristic
                            nation. I replied that I thought that any statement of this kind would
                            come better from the Ambassador than from the Department. The Ambassador
                            then asked me if I had any comment to make in connection with
                            Mussolini’s statement to Mr. Fletcher when he handed him the note. I
                            said that I had no comment to make as it appeared to be similar to the
                            instructions received by the Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>48. Department’s No. 39, February 21, 6 p.m. In pursuance of your
                            instructions I saw Chamberlain this afternoon and repeated the substance
                            of your message to him. He then asked whether I would object to asking
                            him if the British reply were ready. I said that I would not and made
                            the inquiry. He then handed me the draft of the British reply, as

                        <p>Chamberlain then said that this reply could not be made public here until
                            February 28, 4 p.m. The delay was occasioned by delay in receiving
                            answers from two of the Dominions, which, however, would be favorable.
                            He wishes, therefore, that the reply be withheld from publication until
                            the above-mentioned date. I assured him that his wishes in that regard

                        <p>He then remarked that he had received communications from the British
                            Ambassador at Washington to the effect that Italy’s reply might be
                            subject to reconsideration. It was Chamberlain’s opinion that the
                            Italian Government would not like to permit a great conference of the
                            sort proposed to be carried on without having Italy represented on it,
                            provided that special consideration of Italy’s geographical position was
                            assured. He thinks that if this point were <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23"

                            Italian Government and to obtain favorable reply, at least to extent of
                            having an observer at the Conference. He said that it was in this way
                            that Italy gradually pushed her way in at Locarno, and that it was only
                            after the treaties were definitely framed that Italy desired to become a
                                party.<note n="19" xml:id="d18fn19">See Great Britain, Cmd. 2764,

                        <p>The British and Japanese Ambassadors called separately at my request and
                            I said to them, after discussing the matter with the President, that in
                            spite of the refusal of France and Italy to take part in the proposed
                            naval limitation discussions at Geneva we hoped that these conversations
                            could at least be held by Great Britain, Japan and the United States and
                            I inquired whether this procedure was satisfactory to their respective
                            Governments. Both Ambassadors intimated that in their private opinion
                            such procedure would be agreeable to their Governments, but that they
                            would telegraph to ascertain and would let me know in due course. I said
                            that we proposed to reply to the French and Italian notes expressing
                            regrets that they had found it impossible to participate and expressing
                            also the hope that they might find it possible at least to be
                            represented by observers at the proposed conference. Both Ambassadors
                            thought well of this procedure. Mr. Matsudaira asked me whether we had
                            any reason to believe that either France or Italy would reconsider its
                            refusal. I said that we have no official grounds for such a belief, but
                            as the subject was one of vital importance I hoped that those two Powers
                            would at least find it desirable to send observers to follow the
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>In informal conversation I spoke of Italy’s desire for some concrete
                            assurances in advance of the conference that Franco-Italian parity would
                            be maintained and that also that some of the smaller naval Powers, such
                            as Jugoslavia, Greece, et cetera, would be included in the conference. I
                            said it was obviously impossible for us to say in advance that we would
                            support any particular thesis in the conference and that our whole
                            purpose has been to leave the matter absolutely open and unprejudiced
                            for free and friendly discussion at the conference table. As regards the
                            smaller Powers it seems to me that <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0110"
                            />if the larger Powers should agree to limitation, the international
                            fear which was the basis of all naval building would be obviated and
                            that there would then be no purpose for the smaller powers to proceed
                            with extensive building. If they should do so, the greater Powers would
                            then be in a far stronger position to protest. Sir Esme Howard and Mr.
                            Matsudaira both concurred in these views.</p>

                        <p>17. On March 2, in conversation with the Chief of the Division of Western
                            European Affairs, the Japanese Ambassador expressed opinion that
                            conversations between the Governments of the United States, Great
                            Britain, and Japan would result in real accomplishment if it were to be
                            understood in advance that any agreement reached should be flexible and
                            subject to revision. The Ambassador said that his Government would be
                            relieved to know that idea of Three-Power Conference had not been wholly
                            given up as press reports seemed to indicate. He agreed that if
                            three-power conversations were initiated and if France and Italy were
                            invited to be represented in any way they found suitable (e. g., by
                            observers) both nations might finally be brought into actual
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>Also on March 2, the Italian Ambassador informed the Department orally
                            that he had received a cable message from Mussolini who had noted with
                            pleasure that there was nothing in the President’s proposal to prevent
                            Italo-French naval parity, which, he stated is a <hi rend="italic">sine
                                qua non</hi> for Italy. Mussolini stated further that Italy could
                            not be limited in any class of ship, by reason of possibility that
                            Greece, Russia, and Yugoslavia might build large fleets. He was in
                            agreement, therefore, with his technical experts that account must be
                            taken of “global tonnage.” The Ambassador felt that Mussolini personally
                            wished to accept the President’s proposal but that his technical
                            advisers had forced him to refuse.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador mentioned the interdependence existing between naval,
                            land, and air armament, and was told that no reason was apparent why
                            such an interdependence should prevent taking up different categories
                            singly, as limitation in any one class should simplify problem of
                            limitation in other classes instead of making it more difficult.
                            Regarding building programs of other nations, the Ambassador <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0111"/>had it pointed out to him that whatever
                            arrangements were reached, signatory nations would, obviously, have to
                            consult frequently, and that therefore … no particular crisis would be
                            likely to arise. Self-imposed limitation should have, moreover, a
                            calming effect; Italy’s neighbors and others would be much less likely
                            to go in for extensive building if they were relieved of fear of sudden
                            Italian building programs. Main purpose of program of the suggested
                            Conference was to increase mutual trust and to do away with senseless
                            competition. The Ambassador agreed, and said he would transmit these
                            ideas to his Government.</p>
                        <p>On March 4 the Italian Ambassador again discussed question at Department,
                            stating that he had received impression that Japanese Government would
                            not approve of three-power conversations and that he was glad to learn
                            that was a mistake. He stated as his belief that there was much desire
                            in Rome to get into the Conference and that the stumbling block was
                            difficulty of obtaining assurances in advance in regard to parity
                            between Italy and France. Impossibility of deciding such a question in
                            advance of Conference was once more pointed out to him. He again
                            expressed fear that smaller Mediterranean powers might suddenly start a
                            building program which would be dangerous to Italy. In reply it was
                            stated that the arrangements which might be made would be subject to
                            revision under a contingency of that nature, and that in such a
                            circumstance the blame for increase of armaments would, in world
                            opinion, not lie with the great powers thereby forced to reconsider the
                            agreement but instead would rest on the small nation which had made the
                            reconsideration imperative. The Ambassador felt that this was a very
                            strong point which had not been taken into consideration, and he
                            expressed the hope that he might be able to persuade the Italian
                            Government to reconsider its answer; he personally, he said, was now
                            entirely in favor of the proposed Conference.</p>
                        <p>In talking with the British and Japanese Ambassadors today I said that
                            the United States desired to proceed to hold proposed conversations on
                            naval limitation at Geneva on three-power basis in spite of refusal of
                            French and Italian Governments to take part therein and I requested them
                            to ascertain if this procedure would be agreeable to the British and
                            Japanese Governments respectively. I said also that if replies were
                            favorable we would then reply to French and Italian notes and express
                            hope that those two Governments might see their way to be represented at
                            Conference at least by observers.<note n="20" xml:id="d20fn20">Last

                        <p>49. Department has received reports from the Embassy at Tokyo<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d21fn21">Not printed.</note> which indicate that the
                            Japanese Government wishes to obtain some idea of British attitude
                            towards proposal for Three-Power Naval Armament Conference before
                            replying in regard to it. Department believes that if Japanese
                            Government were informed of views the British hold on this subject, they
                            would be inclined to reply favorably. You may intimate to Chamberlain,
                            informally, that it would be most helpful were he to cause indication of
                            above-mentioned views to be given Japanese.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called and read to me the reply of his Government
                            to the President’s proposal for a three-Power naval limitation
                            conference in Geneva, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“If other Powers represented at Washington Conference are
                                    unwilling to take part in new conference suggested by the
                                    President, <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0113"/>we are still
                                    ready to join in a conference of three Powers as soon as
                                    convenient to the United States and Japanese Governments. But
                                    His Majesty’s Government would welcome inclusion of France and
                                    Italy if it were still found possible.</p>
                                <p>“In the meantime discussions of Preparatory Committee must
                                    continue in order that we may see in what way we can usefully
                                    arrange conference proposed by President and how if possible
                                    that conference can be fitted in to larger questions of
                                    disarmament.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he gathered from this message that it was merely
                            an informal reply to our informal proposal and that his Government would
                            probably expect a formal note from us in due course conveying the
                            proposal officially. The Ambassador said in reply to my inquiry that he
                            thought the normal procedure, as long as the conversations had been
                            carried on here, would be for us to address our note to him. I said that
                            we should have to consider whether it would not be well to await the
                            Japanese reply to our informal proposal before addressing formal notes
                            to both Governments. The Ambassador said he fully understood this and he
                            thought that no further step was necessary until we should have heard
                            from Japan. I then asked the Ambassador whether he thought it would be
                            desirable to give publicity to the British reply at once. He answered in
                            the affirmative and said he thought it would be well to say to the press
                            that in view of the apparent failure of the five-Power proposal the
                            British Government was now ready to join in a conference of three Powers
                            as soon as convenient to the United States and Japan.</p>

                            Government to hold a discussion at Geneva among the United States, the
                            British Empire and Japan on the question of the limitation of naval
                            armament. They feel that the definite adjustment of the question would
                            be greatly facilitated, if the willing and active cooperation of France
                            and Italy could be secured. Should it, however, be found impossible to
                            count on such cooperation, the Japanese Government will nevertheless be
                            ready to take part in the proposed discussion among the three Powers,

                            handed by the American Ambassador to the Imperial Japanese Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, February 10, 1927, regarding the possibility of the
                            initiation of negotiations at Geneva concerning the limitation of naval
                            armament between the representatives of the Powers Signatories of the
                            Washington Treaty of 1922, my Government is pleased to learn as the
                            result of informal conversations that the Imperial Japanese Government
                            is willing to participate in negotiations with the United States and
                            Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The American Government regrets that France and Italy should have
                            formally refused the President’s invitation and shares the opinion of
                            the Imperial Japanese Government that their presence would be most
                            welcome at such a conference. This Government sincerely hopes,
                            therefore, that they may decide to be represented at least in some
                            informal manner at the conversation contemplated.</p>
                        <p>These conversations, it now appears, could most advantageously and
                            conveniently begin at Geneva on the first day of June, or soon
                            thereafter.</p>

                            to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the same time personally urging
                            Department’s point of view: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With reference to the Memorandum of the French Government of
                                    February 15, 1927, in reply to that of the American Government,
                                    of February 10, inquiring whether the French Government was
                                    disposed to empower its representatives at the forthcoming
                                    meeting at Geneva of the Preparatory Commission for the
                                    Disarmament Conference to enter into negotiations looking toward
                                    an agreement providing for limitation in the classes of naval
                                    vessels not covered by the Treaty of Washington of 1922, the
                                    Government of the United <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0115"
                                    />States has noted with pleasure that the French Government is
                                    animated by the same spirit that prompted the President of the
                                    United States upon the occasion of his Message to Congress, on
                                    the day on which the above-mentioned Memorandum of the American
                                    Government was handed to the Governments of the Powers signatory
                                    to the Washington Treaty.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the fear expressed by the French Government that
                                    such negotiations would risk compromising the success of the
                                    work of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva, the Government of
                                    the United States is of the opinion that all appropriate
                                    measures taken by the large naval Powers cannot but contribute
                                    towards facilitating the task of the Commission.</p>
                                <p>In the last paragraph of the Memorandum of the French Government
                                    the view is set forth that it is at Geneva and by the
                                    Preparatory Commission itself that the proposal of the American
                                    Government can be effectually examined. The Government of the
                                    United States desires to emphasize the fact that it proposed the
                                    initiation at Geneva of negotiations by representatives of
                                    certain powers at the forthcoming meeting of the Preparatory
                                    Commission, and is therefore of the opinion that far from
                                    undermining the authority of the League of Nations such
                                    conversations as those proposed would be of great service to
                                    that body in an advance towards the solution of a difficult
                                    problem.</p>
                                <p>The Governments of Great Britain and Japan have now acceded to
                                    the proposal of the American Government which has, therefore,
                                    decided to enter into conversations with these powers and
                                    sincerely hopes that the French Government will see its way
                                    clear to be represented in some manner in these conversations in
                                    order that it may be fully cognizant of the course of
                                    negotiations and of the agreements which may be reached.</p>
                                <p>As the French Government already knows, the American Government
                                    has no preconceived ideas regarding any definite ratio for the
                                    limitation of French tonnage. It does not desire to open up
                                    questions already settled by Treaty but wishes to point out that
                                    all other questions relative to limitation of naval armament are
                                    open and that in the projected conversations each power would
                                    have the privilege of taking any position it thought best for
                                    its own protection as a basis for negotiation.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States would be especially gratified
                                    by the presence of representatives of a nation holding the
                                    ideals set forth in the Memorandum of the French Government, a
                                    nation which has, in the past, been associated with the United
                                    States in efforts to further the cause of World Peace.”</p>

                            concerning the proposed conference for the limitation of naval armament
                            to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the same time personally urging
                            Department’s point of view: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“With reference to the memorandum of the Italian Government of
                                    February 21, 1927, in reply to that of the American Government,
                                    of February 10, inquiring whether the Italian Government was
                                    disposed to empower its representatives at the forthcoming
                                    meeting at Geneva of the Preparatory Commission for the
                                    Disarmament Conference to enter into negotiations looking toward
                                    an agreement providing for limitation in the classes of naval
                                    vessels not covered by the Treaty of Washington of 1922, the
                                    Government of the United States has noted with pleasure that the
                                    Italian Government is animated by the same spirit that prompted
                                    the President of the United States upon the occasion of his
                                    Message to Congress, on the day on which the above-mentioned
                                    Memorandum of the American Government was handed to the
                                    Governments of the Powers signatory to the Washington
                                    Treaty.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the assertion of the Italian Government that there
                                    exists an interdependence of every type of armament, the
                                    American Government is nevertheless of the opinion that all
                                    appropriate measures taken by the large naval Powers in
                                    limitation of the naval branch of armament must greatly
                                    contribute in advancing the solution of the problem as a
                                    whole.</p>
                                <p>As for the statement in the Memorandum of the Italian Government
                                    that owing to geographical position and strategic considerations
                                    Italy could not expose itself without grave risks to a binding
                                    limitation of its maritime armaments, it is feared that there
                                    may exist some misapprehension regarding the terms of the
                                    proposal of the President of the United States, The American
                                    Government has no preconceived ideas regarding any definite
                                    ratio for the limitation of Italian tonnage in the classes
                                    referred to, but regards this question as one to be determined
                                    during the proposed conversations. While the American Government
                                    does not desire to open up questions already settled by treaty
                                    all other questions relative to limitation of naval armament are
                                    open and each power would have the privilege of taking any
                                    position it thought best for its own protection as a basis for
                                    negotiation. The American Government is also of the opinion that
                                    an agreement for partial limitation of armaments could expose no
                                    power to danger from the navies of the powers not included in
                                    such an understanding, since no agreement is contemplated which
                                    would not be subject to reconsideration or revision should the
                                    security of any party to it be menaced by the naval program of a
                                    nation not included in the understanding.</p>
                                <p>The Governments of Great Britain and Japan have now acceded to
                                    the proposal of the American Government, which has, therefore,
                                    decided to enter into conversations with these powers and
                                    sincerely hopes that the Italian Government will see its way
                                    clear to be represented <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0117"

                                    agreements which may be reached. The Government of the United
                                    States would, moreover, be especially gratified by the presence
                                    of the representatives of a nation holding the high ideals set

                                    American Embassy was good enough to inform the French Government
                                    of the decision taken by its Government as a result of the
                                    adherence of Great Britain and Japan to the proposals contained
                                    in the American memorandum of February 10, last, to engage in
                                    conversation with these powers.</p>
                                <p>On this occasion the American Government expresses the hope that
                                    the Government of the Republic ‘will see its way clear to be
                                    represented in some manner in these conversations in order that
                                    it may be fully cognizant of the course of the negotiations and
                                    of the agreements which may be reached.’ It is good enough at
                                    the same time to show the paramount value that it would attach
                                    to the presence of French delegation.</p>
                                <p>The American Government specifies on the other hand that it has
                                    no preconceived idea as to the formula that it would be proper
                                    to consider in regard to a limitation of French naval tonnage
                                    and it points out that in the proposed conversations each power
                                    will have the privilege of adopting as basis of negotiation the
                                    attitude that it judges the best for the defense of its
                                    interests.</p>
                                <p>The French Government pointed out on February 15, in its reply to
                                    the first American note, the decisive reasons for which it could
                                    not participate in the Conference proposed by the American
                                    Government for a new limitation of naval armaments.</p>
                                <p>It cannot allow either the weakening of the authority of the
                                    League of Nations, already invested with the problem of
                                    disarmament, in which naval armaments cannot be separated from
                                    land and aerial <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0118"
                                    />armaments, or injury to the principle of the equality of the
                                    powers to which France remains firmly attached, or the exclusion
                                    from the discussion of an essential problem of the states
                                    without whose collaboration no result can be obtained, or the
                                    abandonment of the technical principles on which alone, as the
                                    French delegates have had admitted during the preparatory
                                    discussions, it is possible to base a general limitation of
                                    armaments.</p>
                                <p>In spite of the assurances that the American Government is good
                                    enough to give [of the thought and care] which have inspired its
                                    initiative and as to the principles by which it intends to be
                                    guided, the Government of the Republic cannot see its way to
                                    modify its views towards the proposal which has been put before
                                    it. It persists in thinking that a positive participation of
                                    France in the proposed conference between the United States,
                                    Great Britain and Japan, cannot be considered.</p>
                                <p>Since the delivery of the American memorandum a new element,
                                    which imposes itself on us, has intervened: The Preparatory
                                    Commission of the Disarmament Conference has met at Geneva. From
                                    the beginning the French delegation has affirmed its thesis and
                                    presented a draft convention based on the principle of global
                                    disarmament. A large part of the Commission has shown itself
                                    favorable to it and the debates which have ensued permit of
                                    thinking that it will be largely taken into consideration in the
                                    conclusions of the Commission.</p>
                                <p>Ever since then the French Government is bound to great reserve
                                    as concerns the request of the American Government to be
                                    represented in other discussions whose promoters are inspired by
                                    entirely different principles. It is for us a question of
                                    honesty towards the League of Nations to do nothing which might
                                    allow, in the mind of the delegations which have favorably
                                    received our proposals, a doubt to arise as to the sincerity of
                                    our efforts.</p>
                                <p>The French Government, appreciative of the value that the
                                    American Government attaches to its being directly informed
                                    concerning the conversations engaged in between the three
                                    powers, preserves the greatest sympathy for the American efforts
                                    for disarmament and for peace. It would certainly have liked to
                                    be able to decide now as to the cordial invitation which has
                                    been sent it. It likes at least to think that the American
                                    Government will appreciate the reasons which make it a duty
                                    under the present circumstances to defer any decision as to the
                                    possible participation, even by a simple observer, in
                                    conversations on a limited subject touching on the question of
                                    disarmament.”</p>

                        <p>His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador presents his compliments to the
                            Secretary of State, and with reference to the conversation this <pb
                                n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0119"/>morning between Mr. Kellogg and

                            receipt of information from His Majesty’s Government to the effect that
                            it is their understanding that the United States Government originally
                            intended that conversations rather than a formal conference on the
                            subject of naval disarmament should take place at Geneva between the
                            representatives of the Powers who are now taking part in the Disarmament
                            Preparatory Commission in that city, and that, in the event of these
                            conversations proving fruitful of positive results, a formal conference
                            would then take place between duly accredited representatives of the
                            Powers concerned.</p>
                        <p>Now that any meeting has been postponed until June, however, His
                            Majesty’s Government assume that the United States Government have
                            abandoned the proposal to conduct preliminary conversations and that
                            proceedings will from the outset take the form of a regular conference.
                            In this event, His Majesty’s Government contemplate asking Mr.
                            Bridgeman, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Viscount Cecil of Chelwood,
                            and Admiral Field to act as their Plenipotentiaries at the
                            conference.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note dated March 11, 1927, in regard to the proposed
                            conversations at Geneva concerning the limitation of naval armament,
                            among the representatives of the United States, Great Britain, and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>It was added that these conversations could most advantageously and
                            conveniently begin at Geneva on the 1st day of June or soon thereafter.
                            In this connection I have just received a telegram from my Government to
                            the effect that the Japanese Delegation will leave Japan about the 24th
                            of this month and are expected to arrive at Geneva by way of the Indian
                            Ocean about the 8th June next.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Japanese Government would like to have these
                            conversations opened after the 11th of that month. I beg leave therefore
                            to request pursuant to instructions from Tokio that you will be good
                            enough to take steps so that the wishes of my Government in this respect
                            may conveniently be met by all the parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that the names of the Japanese delegates will be
                            communicated to you as soon as they are officially appointed.</p>

                        <p>116. Reported in press that Three-Power Conference will meet June 20,
                            1927. Department’s latest advice from Great Britain and Japan was that
                            Conference would be held as early as possible after June 11; we had
                            assumed that would mean June 12. If definite date has been arranged
                            please cable.</p>
                        <p>The President and I have conferred with Mr. Hughes,<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d32fn30">Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State, Mar. 4,
                                1921–Mar. 4, 1925.</note> but do not believe that he can attend
                            Conference and in that event do not know of anyone else to invite. Our
                            thought was that if Mr. Hughes was able to go, his international
                            reputation might be of assistance to you and contribute to arriving at
                            favorable result.</p>
                        <p>I discussed with the President and Mr. Hughes the advisability of sending
                            over some good lawyer to help you in drafting the treaty. We thought
                            that we might get Allen Dulles, who, as you are aware, is thoroughly
                            conversant with all the background.</p>
                        <p>We should like to have your views. The Navy will send Admiral Schofield
                            and some other assistants; further information on that will <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0121"/>be sent you. We are very anxious, of
                            course, for success of this Three-Power Conference.</p>

                        <p>241. Until it should be possible to arrive at some idea of developments
                            here I have postponed request for Department’s instructions concerning
                            arrangements for Naval Limitation Conference. The Preparatory Commission
                            will in all likelihood adjourn towards the end of the month, see my No.
                                239,<note n="31" xml:id="d33fn31">Not printed.</note> and will not
                            resume its sessions until after the Assembly meeting in September. There
                            will therefore be no conflict in time between the Three-Power Conference
                            and the Preparatory Commission.</p>
                        <p>It would seem to me inadvisable to approach Sir Eric Drummond<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d33fn32">Secretary General, League of Nations.</note> before
                            the receipt of instructions from you and before further developments
                            could be more clearly estimated. My information is, however, that
                            Drummond would, if requested, be happy to grant us the facilities of the
                            Secretariat’s machinery as he is eager to have the <hi rend="italic"
                                >pourparlers</hi> take place in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Bridgeman, in conversation with me in London, made no secret of the fact
                            that he was opposed to Geneva as a meeting place and that his preference
                            lay in the direction of Brussels or The Hague because they were more
                            accessible to London and were free from the atmosphere of Geneva. He
                            attached some weight to this in the event that the negotiations should
                            be protracted and that his presence in London should, from time to time,
                            be required. I replied that the <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0122"
                            />President had particularly suggested Geneva since he wished it made
                            clear that the conversations were in no manner of means in rivalry with
                            the work of the Preparatory Commission but were, on the contrary,
                            closely connected therewith. I therefore gave it as my assured opinion
                            that we would not be willing to initiate any change in this regard. It
                            is possible that the British will resuscitate the suggestion concerning
                            Brussels or The Hague upon the adjournment of the Preparatory
                            Commission, and should that question arise I hope that a decision in one
                            sense or another will be reached before Drummond is approached. The
                            First Lord’s suggestion contains one sound idea: a large number of
                            persons of all nationalities are always cognizant of any proceedings in
                            the Secretariat and it may be felt preferable to form a secretariat of
                            our own. Since my Japanese colleague informs me that his country’s
                            delegation favors the English language in the conduct of negotiations,
                            this should present no difficulty as the need for translation and
                            interpreting will be avoided. My own convenience will, of course, be
                            best served by the choice of Brussels, but I trust you understand that I
                            would not like this to be taken into consideration in reaching a
                            decision. I might add that the expenditure will be largely reduced in
                            that case since the Embassy Chancery could be used for our work and the
                            considerable expense for headquarters at the hotel be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The Executive Council would, I learn, be inconvenienced should the work
                            commence before June 20, since until shortly before then the Council
                            will be in session. We would hardly be warranted in asking the
                            Secretariat to undergo the large outlay and inconvenience which a
                            carrying on of the conversations coincident with the Council meeting
                            would involve.</p>

                        <p>121. Your No. 241, April 14, 9 p.m. Inasmuch as it was as a part of the
                            Preparatory Commission that the President invited the five powers to
                            confer in Geneva on the limitation of naval armaments, he feels that if
                            the United States were to take initiative in holding Conference
                            elsewhere this would place us in embarrassing position and provide
                            France and Italy with opportunity to allege that we were attempting to
                            disrupt Geneva Conference. Were the other two powers, Great Britain and
                            Japan, to make clear their desire to have Conference <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0123"/>meet at some other place, preferably in
                            Belgium, I do not think that we should oppose it. If the League of
                            Nations would be embarrassed by having these negotiations at Geneva or
                            if the League is not prepared to provide the necessary facilities, for
                            which, of course, we should be willing to pay, we should then have no
                            objection to holding Conference at some other place. You may, if you
                            think wise, approach Sir Eric Drummond on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I should like to have your opinion in regard to distribution of personnel
                            on termination of the Preparatory Commission. Are you and Admiral Jones

                        <p>84. Bridgeman saw Admiral Jones when latter was in London on way to
                            Geneva and raised possibility of moving Conference to some other place.
                            British Naval delegate on Preparatory Commission likewise suggested to
                            Gibson possibility of Brussels. No suggestion of this sort has ever come
                            from anyone in British Foreign Office or from the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Gibson has informed Department that Drummond has stated that, in regard
                            to use of League facilities by Conference in Geneva, he preferred
                            requests for this use to come from states members of League, that is to
                            say, from Great Britain and Japan.</p>
                        <p>As this Conference at Geneva was called by President in connection with
                            work of Preparatory Commission, the United States would not care to
                            change location of Conference except on formal request of Great Britain
                            and Japan, who are members of the League, in which event this Government
                            would willingly consent to change to Brussels. There is no doubt that
                            British and Japanese would be willing to request use of necessary League
                            facilities if it be definitely decided to hold Conference at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>All the above considerations were discussed yesterday with Mr. Chilton of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: First. I have given a
                            great deal of thought to the question of the make-up of our delegation
                            to Geneva. As you know, we have been faced by the alternatives of going
                            through with the same type of representation we had at the preliminary
                            conference, or of framing up a delegation somewhat along the lines of
                            that at the Washington Conference in 1923. It appears that England is
                            sending her First Lord of the Admiralty and Lord Cecil, who is a Cabinet
                            Member without portfolio. Japan has made up a rather distinguished
                            delegation, all of whom are naval officers or ex-naval officers. Saito,
                            the head of the Delegation, was at one time Minister of Marines. So far
                            as Japan is concerned, there is ample reason for sending men who can
                            speak with final authority and make decisions on the ground. Her
                            representatives would be so far away from the home base that they could
                            hardly be expected to refer questions back to Tokyo as they arise from
                            day to day. With us and with England it is, of course, otherwise. It
                            goes without saying that in our case every important move in the course
                            of the proceedings will be either dictated from or approved here.</p>
                        <p>I think we have all felt that Mr. Hughes has unique qualifications for
                            the task. As a dominant figure in the Washington Conference, his
                            appearance on this occasion might add considerably to the effectiveness
                            of any proposals that we may make. However, we know he cannot go.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, without attempting to rehearse the arguments pro
                            and con, I have concluded to recommend to you that we go ahead in the
                            normal, businesslike way, refraining from any effort to produce an
                            artificial impression by the selection of outstanding personalities.
                            This would, of course, mean that Gibson head the delegation and the Navy
                            would send very strong representatives including <pb n="41"
                                xml:id="pg_41" facs="0127"/>Admirals Jones, Long and Schofield, with
                            assistants from the Navy, including Captain Andrews. Allen Dulles,
                            formerly of the Department, will go as legal adviser. If you approve of
                            this course, I think very soon the complete delegation should be
                            announced by you.</p>
                        <p>Second. I have, of course, considered carefully the suggestion you made
                            about Mr. Mellon, Senator Swanson and myself. I am a little afraid it
                            would look like overloading the delegation and make it appear to the
                            other countries that we were overanxious to have an agreement. We are
                            anxious to have an agreement and I think it is important to us that we
                            should, if we can get one, but we are in a rather independent position
                            owing to the fact that we can accept as low a basis as any other
                            country. I will not discuss the various questions as I wish to present
                            to you the complete program which we expect to finish this week. So far
                            as I am concerned personally, I am entirely at your disposal. If I
                            thought it would really do any good by tending to assure the ultimate
                            success of the Conference, I should not hesitate to advise you to
                            instruct me to go. My only anxiety in this matter is for you to get an
                            agreement, which I believe will redound very greatly to the credit of
                            your Administration. Naturally the proceedings may develop at Geneva in
                            such a way as to render it advisable for the Secretary of State to
                            appear later on. If an emergency should arise in which my attendance
                            would clear up a sudden complication and save the conference from
                            failure, I should say by all means that the step would clearly be
                            justified.</p>
                        <p>Third. The third alternative is that someone be sent with Mr. Gibson. I
                            have no doubt you have explored this situation thoroughly. On this I
                            make the following suggestions: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) if it was
                            deemed wise to give Admiral Jones additional prestige, he could be made
                            a co-delegate with Mr. Gibson. He is a level-headed man and I think very
                            liberal and is anxious to have an agreement; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            if any civilian is selected outside of the Senate, the only
                            recommendations I can think of are ex-Senator Underwood and Honorable
                            John W. Davis; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) if Senators are selected, the
                            natural thing would be to send two—a Republican and a Democrat—and they
                            would ordinarily be the Chairman and ranking member of the Foreign
                            Relations Committee or the Chairman and ranking member of the Naval
                            Committee or the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate. You
                            know this situation better than I do so I do not think I need to discuss
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Navy officials and Mr. Gibson will sail a week from tomorrow,
                            June fourth, in order to be over there quite a while in advance to
                            discuss the preliminary organization and program with the other
                            delegates. Anybody else whom you desire to send would have ample time by
                            leaving two weeks from tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>At a conference with the President this morning at 9:15 there were
                            present the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable
                            Hugh S. Gibson, Ambassador to Belgium, Admiral Hilary P. Jones, Admiral
                            F. H. Schofield, Mr. A. W. Dulles, Legal Adviser to the Delegation, and
                            Mr. Marriner, Chief of the Western European Division of the State
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The proposal of the Navy to be laid before the Conference, prepared by
                            the General Board as a result of the conferences in the State Department
                            and contained in Navy’s Memorandum dated June 1, 1927, study No. 1,
                            subject: proposals for the Geneva Conference,<note n="39"
                                xml:id="d43fn39">Not found in Department files.</note> was discussed
                            throughout and approved by the President, who stressed the importance of
                            the adoption of the plan of combining cruiser and destroyer tonnage
                            during the transition until the attainment of the allowed tonnages in
                            each class in order to avoid immediate scrapping of ships under the age
                            limit.</p>
                        <p>The President likewise inquired whether or not the Navy approved the plan
                            as laid down and asked each of the naval members present personally
                            whether they felt that the Navy would back a treaty arising from such a
                            plan whole-heartedly. The replies were all in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>In connection with a possible British proposal to reduce the size of
                            cruisers, the President said of course that the United States could not
                            be satisfied with a lesser number of cruisers of 10,000 tons than Great
                            Britain but agreed that a combination limitation by tonnage and numbers
                            could possibly be worked out which would be satisfactory in all
                            probability to both Powers as it would give Britain the scope she
                            desired for building smaller cruisers.</p>
                        <p>The question of possible discussion of the abolition of the submarine was
                            also raised and the President agreed with those present that in view of
                            the fact that only three nations were present the <pb n="43"
                                xml:id="pg_43" facs="0129"/>question would not be a practical one
                            but that of course we could initiate or support any resolutions
                            indicating our willingness to abolish the submarine when it was
                            universally abolished.</p>

                        <p>The Honorable Hugh R. Wilson, American Minister to Switzerland, will act
                            as Secretary General of the Conference, and Frederic R. Dolbeare,
                            Counselor of Legation, as Secretary of the American Delegation. You will
                            be appropriately empowered to negotiate and, subject to the approval of
                            the President, to conclude an agreement with the Plenipotentiary
                            representatives of Great Britain and Japan for the limitation of naval
                            armaments in classes of vessels not limited by the terms of the Treaty
                            signed at Washington on February 6, 1922.</p>
                        <p>The President, in his message to Congress of February 10th, indicated the
                            reasons which made further naval limitation desirable, and it is upon
                            the considerations therein set forth that your conduct of <pb n="44"
                                xml:id="pg_44" facs="0130"/>the forthcoming negotiations should
                            rest. In this respect, the President re-affirmed, as a fundamental
                            policy of the American Government, its support of measures for the
                            further limitation of armament in the interest of peace and
                            international understanding. It was with a view to making possible a
                            definite step for the further limitation of armaments and to complete
                            the work begun at the Washington Conference that the President proposed
                            the present Conference.</p>
                        <p>The primary object of the Conference, the removal of the danger incident
                            to the competitive building of vessels of war not limited by the
                            Washington Treaty will, it is believed, best be achieved by the
                            extension of the principles and of the ratios of the Washington Treaty
                            as between Great Britain, Japan and the United States. As the President
                            of the United States assumed the initiative in calling the Conference,
                            it is considered that it would be entirely appropriate for you to submit
                            to the Conference concrete proposals as to the tonnage allocations in
                            the various categories of vessels which would be acceptable to the
                            United States and of corresponding tonnages for Great Britain and Japan.
                            Such a statement is therefore submitted herewith, together with an
                            introductory memorandum outlining the reasons which prompt this
                            Government to make the proposals in question.<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d44fn40">Not printed; Mr. Gibson’s statement outlining the

                                p. 24</note> The various problems which may arise for discussion at
                            Geneva have been fully considered in your conferences with the President
                            and with me, and the written and oral instructions which you have
                            heretofore received will be supplemented from time to time by
                            telegraphic instructions in reply to any specific questions which you
                            may present to the Department.</p>
                        <p>To supplement your written and oral instructions, I desire to impress
                            upon you that in the opinion of this Government, the possibilities of
                            success of the Conference will be greatly enhanced if the deliberations
                            of the Conference are restricted to the immediate problem before it,
                            namely, the extension of the principles and ratios of the Washington
                            Treaty to auxiliary vessels. It would be unwise for the Conference to
                            take under advisement any modification of the Washington Treaty, since
                            two of the Powers party to this Treaty are not represented at Geneva.
                            Further, any discussion of the Washington Treaty may properly be
                            postponed pending the Conference to be held in 1931, pursuant to the
                            terms of that Treaty, since it is only after November 1931, that the
                            questions of the future building programs of the five Powers will be
                            presented. I would consider it particularly undesirable for the
                            Conference to take up the question of naval bases, regulated by Article
                            XIX of the Washington Treaty, or to link this question with that of the
                            further limitation of naval vessels.</p>
                        <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>Subject to the foregoing, I desire to leave to your discretion the method
                            and the manner in which you will support the principles and the policies
                            of this Government with respect to the further limitation of naval
                            armament as set forth in this instruction and in the memorandum and

                            <p>“If the plan outlined in the American proposal were adopted on the
                                basis of 300,000 tons of the cruiser class for the United States and
                                the British Empire and 180,000 tons for Japan, and 250,000 in the
                                destroyer class for the United States and the British Empire and
                                150,000 tons for Japan, the following is an approximate estimate of
                                the tonnage that would have to be scrapped provided existing
                                programs of construction were brought to completion: The United
                                States would have to scrap immediately about 60,000 tons of
                                auxiliary combatant surface vessels and 80,000 additional tons of
                                such vessels upon the completion of the present building program;
                                the British Empire would have to scrap about 60,000 tons of
                                auxiliary combatant surface vessels upon completion of the present
                                building program; Japan would have to scrap about 40,000 tons of
                                auxiliary combatant surface vessels upon the completion of her
                                present building program.</p>
                            <p>If the plan outlined in the American proposal were adopted on the
                                basis of 90,000 tons of submarines for the United States and the
                                British Empire and 54,000 tons of submarines for Japan, no scrapping
                                of submarines would be necessary until present building programs are
                                brought to completion.</p>
                            <p>Most of all vessels to be scrapped under the American plan are now or
                                soon will be obsolete.</p>
                            <p>This plan stops competitive building which is the chief objective of
                                this Conference, avoids scrapping of new construction and permits
                                moderate replacement and building programs within clearly defined
                                limits. If a lower limit of total tonnage of the cruiser, destroyer
                                and submarine classes were agreed to, the scrapping programs would
                                be correspondingly increased and the possible building programs
                                would be curtailed.”</p>

                        <p>15. Conference opened this afternoon at 3 o’clock with brief statement by
                            me to the effect that as chairman of the delegation of the power which
                            had suggested the holding of the Conference, I was calling the meeting
                            to order for the purpose of organization. I was thereupon nominated by
                            Bridgeman and seconded by Saito as president of the Conference. Hugh
                            Wilson named secretary general and the secretaries of the respective
                            delegations named. Thereupon rules of procedure were adopted; and the
                            Conference on my motion decided to form an executive committee to be
                            composed of the chief delegates of the three powers with appropriate
                            assistants to determine on further methods of procedure, and credentials
                            committee was named to examine full powers. Executive committee meets
                            Tuesday at 11 a.m. and credentials committee at 3 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Viscount Saito thereupon proposed that the delegates send a message to
                            President Coolidge and read text quoted in my 12, June 20, 5 p.m.
                            Bridgeman cordially supported Saito’s proposal. Thereupon I made

                            June 21st, the committee adopted the following resolution: <quote

                        <p>22. Dulles and I visited Ishii and Saito this morning with a view to
                            learning what the Japanese thought of the British proposals<note n="46"
                                xml:id="d50fn46">See S. Doc. 55, 70th Cong., 1st sess., pp. 28,
                                30.</note> relative to the Washington Naval Treaty. My hope was that
                            they would share the American view that the present Conference should
                            not take up these questions; but Ishii said that while they were limited
                            by their instructions to a consideration of the extension to <pb n="49"
                                xml:id="pg_49" facs="0135"/>auxiliary vessels of the Washington
                            principles, yet they could consider any matters in regard to naval
                            armaments by virtue of their full powers. They had, however, requested
                            instructions from their Government, since they were uncertain as to
                            whether the latter desired a consideration of modifications in the
                            Washington treaty as suggested by the British. Viscount Ishii, in view
                            of his superior knowledge of English, was the chief spokesman, and gave
                            it as his opinion that, while he was unable to predict his Government’s
                            attitude in the premises, the economy effected if the British proposals
                            were adopted seemed rather desirable.</p>
                        <p>To this I remarked that it was not wise to consider the British proposals
                            at the present time, however meritorious they might be, and that the
                            subjects covered by them would, under the stipulations of the Washington
                            treaty, be considered in 1931, at which time France and Italy were bound
                            to participate. Moreover, I pointed out that any agreements that might
                            be made now would be largely academic, and might have to be changed in
                            1931, and that anyhow no replacements would take place until that year
                            or even later; it therefore appeared desirable to postpone discussion of
                            the Washington treaty until 1931, and to bend our entire efforts to the
                            application of the established Washington treaty principles to auxiliary
                            craft.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Viscount Ishii stated that apart from the question of economy,
                            it should be remembered that the Conference in 1931 would not be held
                            until August, and that since the Japanese Diet would not convene until
                            the close of the year, any agreements made at the Conference would not
                            be immediately put into effect. This would embarrass the Government by
                            forcing it either to lose a certain amount of time after the Conference
                            before making its estimates, or making appropriations from the former
                            session of the Diet; that clear estimates for the earlier session were
                            difficult of preparation, since appropriations would have to be asked
                            for vessels of maximum size should no further limitation be arrived at,
                            while, on the other hand, were the duration of capital ships to be
                            extended, the only appropriations necessary would be for making repairs,
                            etc. These were considerations which he thought justified to some extent
                            the British proposals. Upon receipt of instructions from Tokyo, he will
                            again discuss these questions with me.</p>
                        <p>A clear definition of our position will have to be made should the
                            Japanese delegation be directed to support the British proposal, and I
                            am accordingly submitting to you separately a draft statement<note

                        <p>23. During the conversation which was the subject of my telegram No. 22,
                            June 22, 5 p.m., Ishii said that he desired to discuss in all frankness
                            the difficulty with which his Government was faced, and to find out what
                            our attitude would be in regard thereto. Whether justified or not, there
                            existed in Japan a widespread feeling that the ratio of the Washington
                            treaty imposed a position of inferiority upon that country, and that if
                            the figure could be slightly modified in a favorable sense, 3.5 for
                            instance, although 4 would be preferred, it would be of the greatest
                            value.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I gave it as my understanding that the ratios were not
                            arbitrary, but were the result of translating into proportions the naval
                            requirements of the signatory powers, and that these figures were
                            arrived at by agreement among the parties. He countered by stating that
                            at the present time Japan was faced with delicate situations in regard
                            to Soviet Russia and to China. I thereupon made the suggestion that
                            Admiral Jones should confer with Admiral Saito and that he would
                            demonstrate the grounds which we had for our belief that Japan was not
                            placed in a position of inferiority by the present proportion.</p>

                        <p>25. With reference to the proposals for the modification of the
                            Washington treaty which have been brought forward by the British and the
                            receptive attitude which the Japanese have shown thereto, see my
                            telegram No. 22, June 22.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that the most advisable attitude for us to take towards
                            the British proposals is that they should not be considered at the
                            present time by the three powers, but in 1931 when the five signatories
                            of the treaty would be present.</p>

                            ready to sustain the adoption by the Conference of a decision somewhat

                        <p>26. This morning during a conversation with Cecil and Bridgeman, I
                            explained with great care our objections to discussing the subjects
                            covered by the Washington treaty at the present Conference. Cecil and
                            Bridgeman were inclined to insist most vigorously that it would be
                            necessary to have some definite decision for the construction of capital
                            ships before 1931; that it would mean a great saving in the naval
                            budgets of the various countries if the British ideas were carried out,
                            as they believed that the decision of the three powers to refrain from
                            building maximum size ships would have great weight in causing Italy and
                            France to do likewise, and so forth and so forth.</p>
                        <p>Bridgeman asked whether the United States actually insisted upon parity
                            in each class of vessel and made the suggestion that we might not care
                            to construct up to the limits which the British considered were their
                            actual requirements. In replying, I stated that these were matters which
                            we would have to determine when we decided upon our building programs;
                            that, of course, the right of parity was fundamental.</p>
                        <p>Cecil and Bridgeman did not indicate any definite views regarding the
                            total tonnage limitations in the various classes of vessels, but they
                            both were insistent upon the importance of placing limits on the <pb
                                n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0138"/>maximum size of cruisers,
                            destroyers, and submarines. The desirability of two classes of cruisers,
                            one of which would be considerably under 10,000 tons, was particularly
                            emphasized by them.</p>
                        <p>No satisfactory common ground for discussing the specific questions
                            before us has been supplied either by our conversations with the British
                            or by their various proposals. Tomorrow there will be another meeting of
                            the executive committee when, with the idea of getting the work started
                            along definite lines, we will suggest the formation of technical
                            committees to study various matters.</p>

                        <p>27. The British naval delegates and Bridgeman have expressed the view
                            repeatedly that the best way in which to have work initiated on a sound
                            basis is for the delegations of the United States, Japan, and England to
                            make a frank and full public statement of the needs of their respective
                            navies with an explanation justifying the figures claimed. Bridgeman
                            seems anxious to have a plenary meeting called soon and we assume that
                            it is for this very purpose. We think that he will discuss later the
                            burdens, etc., resting on the English Navy because of England’s island
                            position and her consequent vulnerability. At the same time he will, we
                            expect, dwell upon England’s entire dependence upon food supplies from
                            overseas; the necessity that England police individual scattered units
                            of the British Empire and trade routes; the lengthy coast lines of the
                            various dominions and numerous colonies, etc. This is in accord with the
                            British idea to get away from a strict application of the ratio fixed by
                            the Washington Conference and endeavors to prove the necessity for a
                            preponderant British strength. It seems obvious that the demands of the
                            British will be very high, judging from Jellicoe’s indication to Admiral
                            Jones last evening that England would require 500,000 tons of cruisers
                            and considering Bridgeman’s remarks to me this morning that the United
                            States would not need as much in the line of cruisers as would Great
                            Britain. The idea of such a public statement is apparently to lead the
                            United States and the Japanese to make a statement of a similar
                            character as to <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0139"/>their respective
                            needs which the British can then comment on and criticize so as to
                            obscure the issue. I feel that if we were to follow tactics similar to
                            those of the British we would be led into an inconclusive argument as a
                            result of which the British could readily distort our statements and we
                            would then never succeed in clarifying the issue. To me it appears that
                            the only way clearly to maintain the simplicity and clarity of our
                            proposals is for us strictly to adhere to the principles of a
                            fundamental nature which were laid down in the Washington treaty. I
                            think that by adhering closely to those principles there will not be any
                            danger of their distortion and we shall also be on safe ground. Thus
                            should the statement to be made by Bridgeman be of such a nature as we
                            anticipate, I desire in the most simple terms to reiterate the
                            proposition that naval requirements depend upon the vital strength of
                            other powers and are thus purely relative; that the American proposals
                            are clear and comprehensive and demonstrate our willingness to adapt our
                            tonnage figures to the minimum amount as regards auxiliary craft which
                            the other members of this Conference can accept; that our faith in the
                            practicability of the theory of relative requirements is thus plainly
                            evidenced and that our suggestions in regard thereto remain open;
                            conversely, that if a figure higher than that proposed by us is felt to
                            be necessary by the other powers for their needs, our own requirements
                            would have to be increased proportionately and would be on an equality
                            with the higher figure. This appears to us to bring out in bold relief
                            our willingness not only for real limitation but for reduction as well,
                            so that should the tonnage levels be scaled upwards, it is my
                            understanding that the power contending for the greatest tonnage would
                            bear the responsibility therefor. An objective and clear indication of
                            this in our statement may be necessary.</p>

                        <p>31. Bridgeman stated at this morning’s session of the executive committee
                            that he was eager that an early plenary session be held for the purpose
                            of debating the British suggestions regarding battleships and aircraft
                            carriers and asked at what time the other delegates would be prepared to
                            enter upon such debate. In reply I informed him that our instructions
                            did not cover such proposals and were further definitely against any
                            reopening of matters which the Washington treaty had already settled. I
                            added, however, that I had reported fully to my Government which would
                            doubtless instruct me in the premises. Viscount Ishii declared that the
                            position of the Japanese delegates was similar to ours and they were
                            prevented by their instructions from undertaking conversations regarding
                            any revision of the Washington treaty, but that he himself thought
                            certain features of the British suggestions desirable. He had
                            telegraphed to Tokyo accordingly but did not expect a reply within less
                            than a week and until then could not take any stand in the matter. It
                            was proposed by Bridgeman to state in a communication to the press that
                            discussion had been postponed pending receipt of instructions from these
                            Governments but he withdrew the suggestion when opposition thereto
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>Bridgeman expressed the hope to me, after the meeting, that although he
                            realized that no replacement would occur before 1931, we could yet come
                            to an agreement as regards capital ships, since he thought that public
                            opinion would be very favorably influenced if a diminution in maximum
                            tonnages, even if it should only take effect in 1931, were agreed to at
                            this time. He admitted that such a step presented some difficulties and
                            pointed to the fact that the British Navy included two new vessels which
                            considerably surpassed the maximum tonnage which they desired us to
                            accept, but that the possibility of other countries constructing the
                            larger ships had to be reckoned with. He promised to submit to me a
                            proposal which he was engaged in drafting and which he trusted might be
                            acceptable to all concerned.</p>
                        <p>Dulles and Cecil were discussing this matter almost simultaneously. The
                            former felt that it would be unfortunate to engage in a public
                            discussion of the question, inasmuch as we would be forced to give
                            publicity to the fact that under the Washington treaty the British <pb
                                n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0141"/>Navy pending replacements had a
                            tonnage considerably superior to the 5–5 ratio and also had more modern
                            battleships and, further, that were their proposals to be adopted this
                            inequality would be continued beyond the space of time stipulated in the
                            treaty. While the British apparently desire to gain public approbation
                            for having advocated this kind of proposition and wish to make us bear
                            the responsibility for blocking measures they have heralded as being
                            prime requisites to economy and peace, they will probably be satisfied
                            with this move and will not insist rigidly on favorable action on their
                            proposals. We think that, subject to your instructions, this question
                            should be treated in accordance with my telegram No. 25, June 23, 7
                            p.m., and firmly believe that it is highly important to avoid any move
                            at this time which might pledge us in advance to favorable consideration
                            in 1931 of the British proposition.</p>
                        <p>It will take several days for Tokyo to consider the British proposals,
                            according to Ishii; but you may concur with me that the decision of the
                            Japanese Government might be considerably influenced if the possibility
                            of serious consequences arising from reopening the Washington treaty
                            were impressed upon Matsudaira.</p>

                        <p>11. Your No. 27, June 23, 9 p.m. In my opinion your opening speech at
                            Conference, and proposals circulated with it, set forth in their minimum
                            figures this country’s lowest naval necessities;<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d57fn49">See S. Doc. 55, 70th Cong., 1st sess., pp. 24 and
                                185.</note> any revision upward of these figures is due to fact that
                            our needs are relative to sea force which Great Britain and Japan desire
                            to build. Any contention by British that they need large number of
                            cruisers for the protection of their long trade routes carries the
                            implication that they must protect them against some other nation. As
                            the United States and Japan are the only two nations with navies large
                            enough to be a threat to Great Britain, there does not seem to be any
                            logical excuse for excessive tonnage demands.</p>
                        <p>Should the British insist on making an elaborate defense of demand for a
                            high cruiser tonnage, you might, I think, content yourself with making a
                            reiteration in accordance with the suggestion in your telegram. I am
                            further convinced that insistence upon this point would not be misjudged
                            in view of support which the parity with Great <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56"
                                facs="0142"/>Britain has received in this country. The high limit
                            suggested by Jellicoe was, possibly, merely a covert attempt to
                            ascertain whether or not we were sincere on the subject of parity. On
                            that point there can be no question; but it is certain, as well, that we
                            should not care to sign a treaty increasing British cruiser tonnage by
                            about 75 percent and requiring us to triple our effective cruiser
                            strength. Should the British put forward such claims seriously, I think
                            that the public analysis of them would more than justify failure to
                            conclude a treaty, and might even have effect of stimulating zeal of
                            Congress for competitive building.</p>
                        <p>You may in conversation with the British discreetly use any of the
                            foregoing.</p>

                            23, 9 p.m., from Geneva:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of the telegram printed on <ref target="#pg_52"

                        <p>Having in mind the repeated assurances of the British, both at time of
                            Washington Conference on Limitation of Armament and since that time,
                            that Great Britain would accept idea of parity with this country in all
                            classes of naval vessels, the Government of the United States is
                            surprised at attitude of British delegates at Geneva as this attitude is
                            outlined in Gibson’s telegram under reference. See Chamberlain and
                            inform him that in view of continuous absence of both Sir Esme Howard
                            and Mr. Chilton from Washington there is no way to bring up these views
                            informally here, and you have been requested, therefore, to draw their
                            tenor to his attention in friendly spirit.</p>

                        <p>32. There is, in my opinion, no reason for being disheartened even though
                            no specific accord has been reached on any question during the <pb
                                n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0143"/>first week. The obstacles with
                            which we are faced can, I believe, be overcome, although they are
                            serious. The two most difficult ones are the elaboration of a formula
                            which, while satisfying Japanese <hi rend="italic">amourpropre</hi>,
                            will yet maintain the Washington treaty ratio; and the even more serious
                            wish of Great Britain to have no limitation placed upon the number of
                            small cruisers.</p>
                        <p>Judging from the discussions of the past week, I feel quite certain that
                            there will be no insistence on the part of the British upon the taking
                            up of their suggestions in regard to capital ships. It will ultimately
                            be necessary in this regard to arrive at a satisfactory formula
                            providing for postponement of this matter until 1930 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >1931?</hi>], reserving at that time complete liberty of action.
                            Subject to the question of ratio, I am of the opinion that technical
                            agreement with Japan, covering submarines and possibly destroyers, can
                            be reached. At the present time, however, there is considerable
                            divergence between us as regards maximum size of destroyers. The matter
                            upon which there are the greatest differences is that of cruisers, and
                            considerable maneuvering with regard to the order of taking up the
                            various questions is being indulged in. In order to make a rupture on
                            the subject of cruisers alone seem unjustifiable should that question be
                            the only one disputed, the British desire to arrive at a speedy
                            agreement with us in respect of submarines, hoping to get concessions in
                            this class at least. Our position that agreements with regard to the
                            various categories of vessels should be interdependent and that all
                            questions of a technical nature should be examined together is being
                            vigorously maintained.</p>
                        <p>We are, furthermore, endeavoring to dispose, as soon as possible, of the
                            British suggestions concerning the Washington treaty. A satisfactory
                            explanation of their having been propounded is difficult to find unless
                            the British desired to justify their possible refusal to agree to
                            limitation of small cruisers by our refusal of their above-mentioned
                            proposals. They certainly must have known how unacceptable we would find
                            these proposals. It is my hope that all questions bearing upon a change
                            of the Washington treaty will be out of the way before the end of the
                            discussion upon cruisers.</p>
                        <p>The disposition on the part of the American press representatives here to
                            support unflinchingly our position without regard to the political color
                            of their papers has been extremely helpful. It is, in my opinion,
                            producing a distinct effect on the British delegation, who appear,
                            judging from their conversations with American newspapermen, to have
                            taken to heart the outspoken criticism of their proposals which has been
                            published in the American press.</p>

                        <p>33. Each delegation at the Conference has supplied the others with
                            tonnage figures on the basis of the Washington standard ton, so that all
                            three delegations might be able to begin their studies with the same
                            statistical data concerning authorized programs and the tonnages of
                            existing vessels. The American delegation were rather surprised when
                            considering the British figures to find that the tonnage of the 18
                            capital ships exceeding the <hi rend="italic">Nelson</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Rodney</hi> in age aggregated 49,000 tons more than
                            the figures contained in the tables of the Washington treaty, this being
                            due to the fact that they were based on the tonnage basis theretofore
                            used by the British Navy, and not on the Washington standard-ton basis.
                            The belief was generally held that figures based on Washington standard
                            tonnage would prove less than the figures previously published, and such
                            has proved to be the case as concerns the American figures, but the
                            figures previously published by the British proved to be less than the
                            figures based on Washington standard tonnage. Standard-tonnage figures
                            have not yet been received from the Japanese for their capital ships,
                            but based on the Washington standard ton their figures for destroyers
                            and cruisers aggregate approximately less than previously published
                            figures by 8 percent.</p>
                        <p>After the accession of the <hi rend="italic">Rodney</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Nelson</hi> and the inclusion of 18,000 tons for the
                            modernization of six American battleships, the difference in the total
                            standard tonnage between American and British capital ships is about
                            96,000 tons instead of the 33,000 tons which appear in the tables
                            attached to the Washington treaty. It would thus be 1953 instead of
                            1942, as agreed upon, before parity in battleships would be reached if
                            the British proposals were put into effect. Also for the period 1934 to
                            1945, it would give the British an average advantage of 14,000 tons
                            above that under the replacement scheme contemplated by the Washington
                            treaty and between 1945 and 1953, an advantage of about 8,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>The above information is being telegraphed for the information of the
                            State Department and the Navy Department to be used in connection with

                        <p>35. There are indications that British delegation is not wholly satisfied
                            over reception accorded its proposals in regard to modification of the
                            treaty of Washington, and our delegation feels that British might be
                            helped to withdraw from untenable position if, before you leave
                            Washington, you could reinforce our statements here in a frank talk with
                            either Howard or Chilton. In such a conversation we feel that there are
                            certain points which it would be particularly helpful if you could touch
                            upon.</p>

                            <item>Revision of the treaty of Washington. Though the American position
                                has been stated in full it would be well to reiterate our statements
                                explaining that such a revision is not a subject of discussion;
                                that, should the British delegation find some way of not insisting
                                on its proposals, an agreement would be far more easily reached, as
                                the American delegation is not working with any thought of a
                                concession; that while no revision of the treaty will take place at
                                the present Conference, and they may as well recognize that fact
                                now, they may be assured that it is our desire to make a recession
                                from their position as easy as possible.</item>

                            <item>Equality. It seems incomprehensible that any doubt should now
                                exist in regard to our having full parity, for this point has been
                                explained to the proper British authorities for some time past; it
                                would expedite matters if the British delegation would accept the
                                fact that the United States, under an agreement or without it, will
                                insist on its right to parity with the British Empire; and parity
                                reached through a just agreement will be clearly advantageous to
                                them. Should you deem it appropriate you might refer to the fact
                                that I had told you of my reply to Bridgeman’s doubts concerning the
                                necessity for us of parity to the effect that, should I accept a
                                position of inferiority I should be forced to reside abroad
                                permanently, and that you wholly agreed therewith.</item>

                            <item>It is clear that the British delegation consider the 1927
                                congressional building program a play to the gallery to back up the
                                    <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0146"/>President in summoning
                                the Conference and doubt its genuineness. It might be well to
                                impress upon Howard that with his knowledge of the situation in the
                                United States, he could not entertain such an idea; only by
                                suggesting the Conference could the President curtail a building
                                program of considerable size. Should no conclusion be reached at
                                Geneva, probably a greater building program will be considered in
                                the next congressional session; failure in our present task would
                                create competitive building in both countries which could but be
                                most detrimental to our relations, whereas an amicable agreement at
                                this time would not fail gradually to bring about a satisfactory
                                adjustment of naval strength.</item>

                                possible, based upon acknowledgment of our naval requirements, which

                        <p>36. In a conversation this afternoon, Viscount Ishii informed me that the
                            Japanese Government had changed the instructions originally given its
                            delegation, opposing the reconsideration of the Washington treaty, to
                            the extent that it would not offer any opposition to the British
                            proposals for a further discussion concerning capital ships. However, he
                            said they did not consider this subject should be discussed until an
                            agreement relating to the limitation of auxiliary craft had been
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>I replied in a frank manner that I regretted very much their decision to
                            acquiesce in reconsidering any portion of the Washington treaty; that
                            should any portion be changed, it might cause complications to arise, as
                            the treaty was a very delicately adjusted mechanism, but I assured him
                            that I appreciated very much his courtesy in giving me the above
                            information. I further added that as he <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61"
                                facs="0147"/>had been so kind as to inform me of his instructions, I
                            felt that I should be equally frank in communicating mine to him.
                            Accordingly, I read to him those portions of our instructions which I
                            considered most pertinent, and stated that these instructions had only
                            been strengthened by those comments on the British proposals which had
                            been received from Washington; that I felt I was so placed that I could
                            tell him quite frankly that the American delegation was not maneuvering
                            with any intention of eventually making concessions of any kind; that
                            the Washington treaty was brought into force by five signatory powers
                            and that the treaty could not be reopened if any one of them was opposed
                            to such action. Further, that there was always the danger that efforts
                            might be made to revise other provisions if any portion of the treaty
                            was changed; that quite a number of people in the United States were of
                            the opinion that our Government had made too many concessions with
                            regard to our naval bases in Guam and the Philippines, and that if the
                            treaty was again being considered, it was very possible that agitation
                            would arise for a reconsideration of these questions; that on principle
                            we were opposed to the revision of any item of the treaty and that we
                            considered that the only wise course to pursue would be to hold the
                            treaty intact until 1931 before considering a revision. Any attempt to
                            reopen the treaty would fail, I said, as we are not willing to consent
                            to such action. Therefore, it would be to no advantage for any of us;
                            and this being so, it would seem better to avoid such a situation.
                            Before departing, Ishii thanked me for the information I had given him,
                            and said he had come to inform me of the instructions received from his
                            Government before telling Bridgeman of them. Altogether our conversation
                            was most frank and cordial.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been requested by
                            Sir Austen Chamberlain to give you the following information as to the
                            aims of His Majesty’s Government in bringing up at the Geneva Conference
                            the question of reducing the size of capital ships and of their guns in
                            case these aims are not fully appreciated over here.</p>
                        <p>I understand that at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Geneva
                            Naval Conference on June 24th, Mr. Bridgeman, the First Lord of the
                            Admiralty, in bringing up this matter explained that it <pb n="62"
                                xml:id="pg_62" facs="0148"/>was one to which the British Empire
                            attached the greatest importance and that it would be impossible to
                            avoid a public discussion on the subject in which arguments on both
                            sides would no doubt be developed. The American and Japanese delegates
                            then stated that this proposal had come as a surprise to them and that
                            they must telegraph for the views of their respective Governments which
                            it might take some days to get.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason that His Majesty’s Government desire that it should
                            be made clear to the United States Government why the question of
                            reducing capital ships was included in the British proposals. The
                            reasons were as follows: <list>
                                <label>1st.</label>
                                <item>Desire to carry the principle embodied in Washington Treaty a
                                    stage further,</item>
                                <label>2nd.</label>
                                <item>Desire to help the Preparatory Committee of the League of
                                    Nations to achieve better results than heretofore when it
                                    resumes its sittings in November by giving it the opportunity of
                                    following the example set by the three Naval Powers which should
                                    be reflected in the results registered by the Committee,</item>
                                <label>3rd.</label>
                                <item>Desire to reduce the burden of expenditure which is one of the
                                    objects of the reduction of armaments, since it is in
                                    battleships that the greatest saving can be effected. In the
                                    view of His Majesty’s Government this proposal in no way
                                    contravenes the letter or the spirit of the Treaty of Washington
                                    but is on the contrary an effective furtherance of the spirit of
                                    that Treaty since the Five Powers, parties to the Treaty, only
                                    bound themselves not to build battleships above a certain size.
                                    If therefore before the expiry of that Treaty three of those
                                    Powers are willing to reduce the size of their capital ships
                                    below the treaty limit, there can not only be no violation of
                                    the letter of the Treaty but rather, as already remarked above,
                                    an effective furtherance of its spirit.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Sir Austen Chamberlain hopes that the competent authorities of the United
                            States Government will, after these explanations, not misunderstand the
                            spirit that has actuated His Majesty’s Government in putting forward
                            these proposals, which seemed to them to be in accordance with the views
                            of the President of the United States in inviting the signatories of the
                            Washington Treaty to discuss the possibility of a further reduction of
                            naval armaments in the spirit of that Treaty. He also hopes that the
                            United States Government will not be under any misapprehension as to the
                            sentiments of His Majesty’s Government in regard to this question if
                            they are obliged to give similar explanations to the public in the event
                            of discussions, which may take place later on this subject.</p>
                        <p>I should be very grateful if you would take an early opportunity of
                            bringing the above to the knowledge of the President.</p>

                                >supra.</hi></note> There is I believe a complete answer to the
                            British claim for the revision of the Washington Treaty at this
                            Conference. None of the Powers can lay down any new ships until 1931 so
                            that there is no object at this time in entering into an agreement for
                            the reduction of the size or the extension of the life of battleships.
                            No ships can be built except for renewals and the first ones to be built
                            can be laid down in 1931, completed in 1934. The Washington Treaty
                            provides for a revision in 1931 at which Conference all the five Powers
                            would be represented. So it seems inadvisable to revise the Treaty four
                            years before any ships can even be laid down, especially as two of the
                            Signatories are not present at Geneva. The plea, therefore, which the
                            British Government is making to the public that this is a matter of
                            economy is without any merit at this time. Parenthetically, I should say
                            that the substance of Sir Esme Howard’s letter was given to the press
                            yesterday but I am bringing it to your attention in accordance with his
                            request.</p>
                        <p>Quite likely there is another reason why the British are very anxious to
                            have an agreement at this time for the prolongation of the life and a
                            reduction in the size of battleships upon renewals. The United States
                            has no capital ships exceeding in size 32,600 tons. The British have two
                            new ships—the <hi rend="italic">Rodney</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Nelson</hi>—about completed which are about 35,000 tons, the most
                            powerful battleships ever built. It would be to Great Britain’s
                            advantage, of course, that all renewals should not exceed 30,000 tons or
                            25,000 tons, whichever is agreed upon, because she already has these two
                            new ships and the United States would be prohibited from building to
                            match them. Personally I think we could afford to cut the size of
                            battleships to 30,000 tons, perhaps less provided in building additional
                            ships Great Britain would agree that we could be compensated by
                            reductions on her part but at present this could not well be done
                            without the consent of France and Italy. In any event, it seemed to the
                            Navy that it would be best not to open up a revision of the Washington
                            Treaty at this time as no one would know to where it would lead. Of
                            course, the Navy claims that we need larger battleships because of their
                            wider range for cruising, we having but few naval bases throughout the
                            world. I do not know how much there is to this but I cannot see that <pb
                                n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0150"/>we would need battleships except
                            for defense and in our Philippine possessions.</p>

                        <p>20. Your No. 35, June 27, 8 p.m. At present there is neither a British
                            Ambassador nor Chargé in Washington. Entire force has moved to the North
                            Shore, leaving only a third secretary at the Embassy who knows nothing
                            about the matter under discussion. There is no use in trying to do any
                            business through Embassy here, as I have informed Sterling who
                            undoubtedly communicated the information to British Government. American
                            Embassy in London has also been furnished with copies of your telegram
                            No. 27, June 23, 9 p.m., and of our No. 11, June 24, 8 p.m., to you.
                            With the latter we included the following instruction:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the final paragraph of the Department’s telegram No. 138,
                            June 25, 1 p.m., printed on <ref target="#pg_56">page 56</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>We have not yet heard from Sterling in reply. I shall communicate further
                            with him along lines of your No. 35.</p>
                        <p>I should prefer not to leave Washington if there is any possibility that
                            my absence would delay or embarrass proceedings at Geneva.</p>

                        <p>44. [Paraphrase.] Last night Bridgeman sent for Sharkey of the Associated
                            Press and drafted with him the following authorized interview, text of
                            which I deem it wise to cable to Department for its records: [End

                                <p>“Great Britain has no intention of contesting the principle of
                                    parity between the naval strength of the United States and Great
                                    Britain, Mr. Bridgeman, the First Lord of the British Admiralty,
                                    said tonight in an exclusive statement to the Associated Press.
                                    Mr. Bridgeman added that he was surprised to see that an
                                    impression seemed to prevail in some quarters that Great Britain
                                    was asking for supremacy. He said that he was not aware of
                                    anything that had been said by any of the British delegates that
                                    could convey that idea. He continued: ‘Our policy has been to
                                    state frankly what are the British requirements but we never
                                    disputed the American claim for parity as established by the
                                    Washington treaty. It is true that we think our special needs
                                    demand higher number in certain types of vessels but we do not
                                    deny the right of the United States to build up to an equal
                                    figure in any type of warship if she thought it necessary. As
                                    regards battleships I have seen statements that the possession
                                    by Great Britain of the new ships, the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Rodney</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nelson</hi>, would
                                    give Great Britain some superiority if her proposals to limit
                                    the future size of battleships to 30,000 were adopted but I am
                                    sure that a continuance of parity arrived at in Washington in
                                    battleships could be secured by a reasonable adjustment of
                                    replacement tables.’ ”</p>

                        <p>45. There are summarized below certain changes in the situation which are
                            considered most favorable to us: <list>

                                <item>After apparently planning to justify their claim to
                                    superiority in naval strength, the British have weighed the
                                    matter and changed their minds. The idea of absolute parity
                                    between the United States and Great Britain has been
                                    unequivocally admitted by Bridgeman. (Reference is made to my
                                    telegram No. 44, June 30, 1 p.m., concerning this.) Bridgeman
                                    has told me that he considers it to be preferable <pb n="66"
                                        xml:id="pg_66" facs="0152"/>for us to postpone public
                                    sessions at this time and he has put an end to the insistence
                                    for public debate on the naval needs of Great Britain and the
                                    United States. It is felt that your well-timed inquiry through
                                    our Chargé at London in regard to this matter was most
                                    beneficial to us.</item>

                                <item>It is believed that the British are conscious that they cannot
                                    force revision of the Washington treaty by using any rush
                                    tactics upon us. The original statement made by Bridgeman has
                                    now been publicly qualified by his announcing that the
                                    possession by the British Empire of three ships of greater
                                    tonnage than those possessed by the United States will
                                    necessitate numerous technical adjustments before any
                                    arrangement for the reduction of maximum tonnage of capital
                                    ships can be reached.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>A reasonable and sensible spirit has been exhibited in the
                                    work thus far done by the technical committees. Although we are
                                    conscious that the cruiser problem is one of great difficulty,
                                    it is felt that there is a growing desire to reach an agreement
                                    and that the United States’ position is such that we have no
                                    grounds for fears on this score. In regard to the points,
                                    tentative agreement has been reached with great ease.</item>

                        <p>53. On the afternoon of July 1, Admiral Hara and Captain Toyoda of the
                            Japanese delegation accompanied Captain Egerton of the British
                            delegation to call on Admiral Schofield for the purpose of informally
                            discussing the problem of cruisers. The conversation was opened by
                            Admiral Schofield, who said that the British claim of 75 cruisers as a
                            necessity for them was so large that it appeared to constitute no
                            limitation whatever. Upon being asked for figures upon which British
                            minimum requirements for total tonnage could be based, Egerton said that
                            an irreducible minimum was 75 cruisers and that the minimum type would
                            displace 7,500 tons. This would therefore total 598,200 tons for
                            cruisers of all classes. It was further stated by Egerton that if the
                            smaller type of cruiser were unacceptable to us the British figure would
                            be increased as, in that <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0153"/>event,
                            Britain would require 75 cruisers of 10,000 tons displacement, or
                            750,000 tons in all. Schofield replied that, since this would in reality
                            constitute no limitation, we could perceive no purpose in entering into
                            a treaty for limitation of naval armaments on such a basis. In support
                            of the British demand, Egerton advanced the explanation that the
                            cruisers above-mentioned would serve the purely defensive purpose of
                            securing and linking up the Empire’s trade routes, preventing the
                            interruption of the supply of food to the British Isles, etc.; the
                            pressure for cruisers was very strong in the Dominions he stated and
                            added that there could be no reduction in the number given, which had
                            been reached as the result of careful and thorough study.</p>
                        <p>In reply the opinion was expressed by Schofield that the publication of
                            such a figure would be very unfortunate since, should an agreement not
                            be reached, the press in each country would be given to unfavorable and
                            mutual criticism which might gravely impair those cordial relations the
                            promotion of which was our fundamental principle. Egerton said that he
                            was fully aware of this but that “they were welcome to criticize until
                            they were blue in the face so far as Great Britain was concerned.” The
                            difficulties of the problem were recognized by Captain Toyoda, who said
                            that the two theses appeared so widely separated as to be
                            irreconcilable. During the discussion Toyoda took the attitude of a
                            listener rather than that of a participant.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested by Schofield that an agreement might perhaps be reached
                            covering the particular period of the treaty proposed and he also
                            suggested that by considering building and scrapping programs it might
                            be possible to find a formula for agreement. To this Egerton replied by
                            saying that this was an entirely new idea which had not as yet been
                            studied; that he felt that it had some promise; he expressed
                            gratefulness to Schofield for advancing it; that it appeared to offer a
                            means of escaping from a dilemma of a serious nature, but that in spite
                            of all this he would have to consult with Bridgeman on this point before
                            he would be ready for any further informal conversations.</p>
                        <p>Egerton today said that he had spoken to Bridgeman and that Bridgeman had
                            instructed him to state that the delegation of Great Britain would be
                            willing to consider Schofield’s idea provided however that we “in
                            advance wholeheartedly” agreed to aspects of the following principles: <list>

                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>He said that, subject to our agreement on these points, the British would
                            be able to say that their total tonnage arrived at in 1936 would be
                            462,000 tons. Schofield then asked whether after arriving at that total
                            tonnage the British would agree to refrain from increasing it in
                            subsequent years. Egerton answered that this was an arrangement which
                            was to run only to 1936 and that as the British replaced their
                            6-inch-gun cruisers they would increase tonnage gradually to a maximum
                            of approximately 562,000 tons. As he understood it, he said, this was
                            simply postponing until 1936 what at present seemed to be a serious
                            difference between the American and British delegations. Schofield then
                            pointed out that the original 1936 proposal was 505,996 tons and that
                            this new proposal came within 40,000 tons, the equivalent of four
                            cruisers, of that total. In conclusion, Egerton said that Bridgeman had
                            stated to Kim that if the American delegation did not agree to the four
                            above-mentioned points, it was “quite useless for him to waste his time
                            in making studies.”</p>
                        <p>Admiral Jones and I concurred that an answer ought to be made to Captain
                            Egerton to the effect that the United States was not prepared to make
                            promises of a blind character with regard to the acceptance of the four
                            above-mentioned points in exchange for a promise to consider what is a
                            reasonable suggestion, and that, therefore, the question had better be
                            sent back to the technical committee.</p>
                        <p>I was told today by Saburi that the Japanese delegation was “shocked” by
                            the figures of the British and that it was felt by the Japanese
                            delegation that it would probably be necessary within a few days for the
                            American and Japanese delegates to discuss the matter seriously with
                            Bridgeman urging him to lower the British figures to reasonable
                            proportions which would constitute a general limitation. Saburi stated
                            that the delegation of Japan was anxious for real limitation and he
                            added that he believed that the entire world would be shocked at the
                            proportions of the figures of the British.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to doubt that much pressure is being brought to bear on the
                            British by the Dominions so far as the building of cruisers is
                            concerned, as some of the delegations from the Dominions have expressed
                            their entire indifference with regard to this subject and they have said
                            that they were present in Geneva solely to establish the constitutional
                            principle of participation by the Dominions in negotiations which affect
                            the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Should it become necessary to have a consultation of the delegations of
                            the three powers, we intend to say that if the British are disinclined
                            to reduce their figures in a manner such as will enable them to be
                            incorporated in a treaty for “naval limitation” we think that it would
                            be decidedly more honest for them to publish their figures, together
                            with their justification therefor, and to state quite frankly <pb n="69"
                                xml:id="pg_69" facs="0155"/>that it was impossible to come to an
                            agreement; that therefore we feel that the entire matter ought to be
                            left for the consideration of public opinion until an opportunity
                            presents itself to reach general agreement in 1931.</p>

                        <p>26. I have consulted the Secretary in regard to your No. 53, July 2, 11
                            a.m.</p>
                        <p>No proposition by British delegation which sets total cruiser tonnage
                            figure to be arrived at before 1936 at a higher figure than 400,000
                            tons, a figure which itself this Government considers excessive, would
                            make conclusion of an agreement worth while at present time. You may
                            either formally or informally inform British delegation of this view
                            whenever you deem expedient. Unless I receive your advice to the
                            contrary, I intend to consult the Canadian and the Irish Legations to
                            ascertain whether either of these Governments has demanded extensive
                            increases in tonnage; you may, in your discretion, so inform the British
                            delegation. I should like to know if you wish me to take up the matter
                            with the Japanese Ambassador also.</p>

                        <p>58. Department’s No. 26, July 2, 11 a.m. [<hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>].
                            The British have been informed by us already that we do not consider
                            that the figures which they suggested constitute any real limitation and
                            that unless they are willing to consider more reasonable figures we
                            would be averse to concluding any agreement.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the demands for increased tonnage by the Canadian and Irish
                            Governments, we would advise against asking their representatives in
                            Washington for this information, as both Ministers very likely would
                            feel that they should support any measure emanating <pb n="70"
                                xml:id="pg_70" facs="0156"/>from the British Government; we are
                            obtaining this material here in a most casual manner and it is believed
                            that our inquiries will be fruitful of more accurate figures than if
                            formal inquiries were made by the Department in Washington.</p>
                        <p>While no objection is perceived to discussing the situation with the
                            Japanese Ambassador in Washington, we cannot see where any particular
                            advantage would be gained by such a course, as we are working here with
                            the Japanese delegation on a basis of full and frank agreement.</p>

                        <p>147. Following is text of telegram from Gibson, July 2, 11 a.m.:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of telegram No. 53, printed on <ref
                                target="#pg_66">page 66</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>Tonnage figures suggested by Captain Egerton are considered by Department
                            to be so excessive as to be beyond consideration by this Government.
                            Better attempt no limitation at all than to go before the world with a
                            proposition which almost doubles present British cruiser tonnage which,
                            built and building, is 387,000 tons, of which approximately 60,000
                            approaches the age limit. Would British budget stand such a building
                            program? If you think that any useful purpose would be served, I should
                            be glad to have you express our views to Baldwin on account of apparent
                            contradictions in British Government’s attitude; or, if you are unable
                            to see him, discuss matter with Chamberlain.</p>

                        <p>60. At a meeting of the technical committee this morning the Japanese
                            delegation announced that they had received instructions authorizing
                            them to withdraw their proposal that submarines of less than 700 tons be
                            exempt from limitation but would request special consideration for
                            allocation of submarine tonnage.</p>
                        <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0157"/>
                        <p>Upon reopening the question of cruisers and upon request of British
                            delegation, Admiral Jones read the following statement as the American
                            suggestion of a method of eventually reconciling the British proposal
                            based on numbers with the American proposal based on total tonnage:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The position of the United States delegation is that we cannot
                                    discuss cruiser tonnages in excess of 400,000 tons for the
                                    period ending December 31st, 1936.</p>
                                <p>That during that period we would require full liberty of action
                                    to build 10,000-ton cruisers up to a total of 250,000 tons,
                                    recognizing at the same time the full rights of other powers to
                                    build cruisers of similar characteristics up to tonnages in
                                    accordance with the principles of the Washington treaty.</p>
                                <p>That we have no intention or desire to replace the ten cruisers
                                    of the <hi rend="italic">Omaha</hi> class carrying 6-inch guns
                                    during the period, except in the case of loss of one or more of
                                    those units.</p>
                                <p>That, in an effort to meet the British viewpoint regarding a
                                    limitation in the number of large cruisers, we are willing for
                                    this period and without prejudice to future action to limit our
                                    further construction without a total tonnage limitation of
                                    400,000 to vessels of a smaller tonnage to be agreed upon.</p>
                                <p>We do not see any reason for limiting the caliber of guns at [<hi

                                    anything different from that in the larger class.</p>
                                <p>We believe that each power should have full liberty at design and
                                    armament of a smaller class of cruisers should such a class be
                                    adopted for the period in question.</p>
                                <p>This statement of American policy should be construed as our
                                    maximum effort to meet the British viewpoint.</p>
                                <p>We greatly prefer that within a total tonnage limitation and
                                    within the characteristic cruisers provided for in the
                                    Washington treaty that each power enjoy full liberty of
                                    action.</p>
                                <p>We invite attention to the fact that our original proposal was
                                    for a total tonnage limitation in the cruiser class of between
                                    250,000 and 300,000 tons. We still ardently desire that the
                                    total tonnage limitation of cruisers to be agreed upon shall be
                                    very much lower than 400,000 tons as we believe that an
                                    agreement on such a figure would be an extremely useful service
                                    to the cause of limitation. If it is found possible to agree
                                    upon a figure materially lower than 400,000 tons, the American
                                    requirements regarding cruisers of the larger class could be
                                    revised downward.</p>
                                <p>Any limitation on the basis of a cruiser tonnage in excess of
                                    400,000 tons we regard as so ineffective a limitation as not to
                                    justify the conclusion of treaty at this time.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned to afford opportunity for study and

                        <p>61. In an endeavor to settle the cruiser problem, I requested Saburi to
                            come over this morning to discuss with me just what steps we might take
                            now in that direction.</p>
                        <p>Saburi informed me that the Japanese delegation were of the opinion that
                            the building of 400,000 tons of cruisers by Great Britain and the United
                            States would necessitate more naval construction by their Government
                            than it wished to undertake; and that, sooner than agree to any such
                            tonnage figures, the Japanese delegation would return to Japan without a
                            treaty. He suggested, as he had in previous conversations, that the
                            American and Japanese delegations have a conference with Bridgeman and
                            urge upon him the absolute necessity of cutting down the British
                            figures. The American views, I informed him, had already been given
                            emphatically to the British delegation and I was of the opinion that the
                            greatest effect would be obtained if Saito took the initiative and
                            impressed upon the British the absolute necessity for a material
                            revision downward in their figures. If such action were taken by Saito,
                            I told him, he would have the strong support of the American delegation.
                            Saburi said that he considered this a good policy to pursue, and it was
                            agreed that the American and Japanese delegations should have a
                            preliminary conference tomorrow (Viscount Ishii being absent from Geneva
                            today) after which we will be prepared to make an appointment with
                            Bridgeman to discuss the matter. In the hope that Bridgeman will be
                            influenced by the newspaper comment regarding the desirability of lower
                            cruiser figures, it seems best for us to permit a day or two to pass
                            before interviewing Bridgeman. Saburi was assured by me that the
                            American delegation would welcome the Japanese delegation’s demand that
                            the British revise their cruiser figures downward and that we would use
                            all our influence to support them.</p>

                        <p>27. In the course of a conversation this morning with the British
                            Ambassador he said he had been authorized to state that his Government
                                <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0159"/>had no intention of disputing
                            our right to parity with Great Britain. The Ambassador further stated
                            that he received instructions to raise question of reduction in size and
                            extension of life of battleships, as his Government felt that a change
                            in the Washington agreement would not be constituted thereby.</p>
                        <p>In reply I stated that we did not expect to take up question of
                            Washington agreement at this time and that question of economy in
                            connection with British suggestions did not come up, in reality, until
                            1931, at which time all the parties would have to meet. I replied to his
                            objections that plans for laying down vessels would have to be made
                            before 1931, by stating that date of Conference could be advanced, by
                            agreement among the parties, to January 1931.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Ambassador that the Japanese Ambassador had told me that
                            Japanese delegation had been instructed to discuss subject of reduction
                            in size and extension of life of battleships to become effective after
                            1931, but only to enter upon this discussion after agreement had been
                            reached respecting other classes of vessels and not with view to
                            revising Washington agreement at this time. I said I thought there would
                            be no objection to such a discussion.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to point out to the Ambassador that any extension in life
                            of battleships would still further put off time when we could arrive at
                            equality with British Navy. He thought I was mistaken and said he would
                            send me a memorandum on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I then stated, as my belief, that the Conference was in somewhat critical
                            position owing to very large tonnage demands which the British
                            delegation had made, and I said that a limitation agreement which would
                            have effect of almost doubling Great Britain’s cruiser tonnage would
                            provoke open ridicule and that the United States would never accept it.
                            He remarked that the best thing to do then would be to give up the whole
                            Conference, to which I replied that that might well be the case as we
                            could not sign a treaty embodying any such figures as the British had
                            proposed. The Ambassador said that it was his impression, gained from
                            what the President had said, that the object to be attained was a
                            limitation and that the actual figures were not important. I told him
                            that the matter had been most carefully considered by the President, by
                            the Navy Department, and by the Department of State and that I knew for
                            a certainty that the President had no idea that the British would demand
                            a tonnage so excessive. I went on to ask him against whom this enormous
                            number of cruisers was needed, as only this country and Japan now
                            possessed first-class navies. He mentioned the Mediterranean countries,
                            and I reminded him that any treaty signed by the three powers now in
                            Conference at Geneva would contain a clause empowering any one of
                            parties to it to call for revision of the treaty; <pb n="74"
                                xml:id="pg_74" facs="0160"/>should that party feel itself threatened
                            by building program of any power not a signatory.</p>
                        <p>Do you share with me the opinion that there would be no objection to
                            discussing informally, after agreement has been reached on auxiliary
                            vessels, the reduction in size and extension of life of capital ships on
                            understanding that such discussion should be merely of preparatory
                            nature to clear way for 1931 Conference?</p>

                        <p>63. This morning, accompanied by Admiral Jones and Dulles, I saw
                            Bridgeman, who was most desirous for an interview. With Bridgeman were
                            Cecil and Admiral Field; and the cruiser question was debated at length,
                            somewhat tensely by the British delegation. In answer to Cecil’s heated
                            inquiry whether the statement delivered to the technical committee (my
                            telegram No. 60, July 5) was an ultimatum, I replied that our
                            negotiations were not carried on by ultimata but that Admiral Field had
                            requested Admiral Jones for his reaction to the British proposals during
                            the debate on the cruiser question in the technical committee.</p>
                        <p>Following this, Cecil reiterated the well-known arguments concerning the
                            British need for protection of food lines and Admiral Field outlined the
                            reaction of the British Navy to the American proposals. Stressing the
                            Empire’s vital necessity for numbers in the matter of cruisers, he
                            interpreted the American proposal of 400,000 tons to mean that Britain
                            could only construct fifteen 10,000-ton ships to our twenty-five and
                            that the remainder of their tonnage would be used in vessels too small
                            to be of value, that is, about sixty ships of about 7,800 tons each.
                            This he said would make them only equal to the Japanese in 10,000-ton
                            cruisers and far below the United States in combat strength, and any
                            further decrease in larger cruisers to permit more smaller vessels would
                            actually leave the Japanese superior to them in this regard.</p>
                        <p>We were then pointedly questioned as to our real aims in pressing for the
                            building of 10,000-ton 8-inch-gun cruisers, which they criticized as
                            constituting the large offensive type. It was our insistence <pb n="75"
                                xml:id="pg_75" facs="0161"/>upon this type of cruiser, which they
                            claimed they eventually wished to eliminate, that compelled them to
                            demand such high tonnage levels as were imputed to them. In conclusion,
                            we were closely interrogated as to our reasons for mentioning this type
                            of cruiser and they warned us that the result of our suggestions would
                            either be to give the United States an absolute supremacy in offensive
                            cruisers or compel the British to abandon construction of the small
                            defensive type, which in view of the Empire’s needs were in their
                            opinion essential.</p>
                        <p>They held that the reduction of the offensive power of fleets was the
                            basic object of the parley; and minimized the importance of reduction of
                            total tonnages as not going to fundamentals. Total tonnage thesis, they
                            said, would only inspire each country to construct the greatest number
                            of maximum-sized ships and increase fleet offensive power.</p>
                        <p>It is my desire in the foregoing to outline the views of the British and
                            give them in the tone in which they were rendered. The wisest course to
                            pursue, I thought, was to give the British the floor, and in answer to
                            their questions as to the need of 10,000-ton cruisers, Admiral Jones
                            merely emphasized the view of the United States Navy, with which you are
                            entirely conversant.</p>
                        <p>As a compromise and to satisfy the necessity of the British for a great
                            number of cruisers, Admiral Field launched the idea of limiting only
                            cruisers under the age of 20 years and permitting the retention of all
                            cruisers exceeding 20 years.</p>
                        <p>We dispersed without a solution having been reached, but decided that we
                            should all review the entire question with great care. The meeting
                            lasted an hour and a half, towards the end of which the atmosphere had
                            brightened considerably and Bridgeman on leaving remarked in a friendly
                            way that our general attitude was clear to him and only time was needed
                            to solve matters. His demeanor, which throughout had been good-natured,
                            formed a marked contrast to Cecil’s.</p>
                        <p>On Friday, the executive committee will meet to hear the report of the
                            technical committee outlining tentative agreements reached in reference
                            to destroyers and submarines, such agreements being of course dependent
                            upon the outcome of the cruiser problem.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the British proposal for the retention without
                            limitation of cruisers over 20 years old will be considered and we shall
                            also discuss privately and technically with the English the proposal
                            that cruiser-building programs up to 1936 should be dealt with by the
                            treaty.</p>

                        <p>64. The British and American delegates, at the invitation of Viscount
                            Saito, met informally with the Japanese delegates at the Hotel
                            Beau-Rivage, at which time the memorandum given below was circulated by
                            the Japanese delegation. Viscount Ishii stated that the Japanese
                            delegation desired to lay their views informally before the other two
                            delegations as they had not given any intimation at the meeting of the
                            technical committee regarding the total tonnages which Japan considered
                            adequate. The views expressed by the Japanese at this informal meeting
                            would be presented to the executive committee in a more formal way at a
                            later period, he said. (For an outline of developments during the
                            meeting of the technical committee, see my telegram No. 65, July 6.)</p>
                        <p>Following is text of Japanese memorandum:<note n="54" xml:id="d77fn54"
                                >Memorandum not paraphrased.</note>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It will be remembered that in the statement made by the Japanese
                                    delegation at the first plenary meeting emphasis was laid upon
                                    the existing status which they proposed should form the basis of
                                    any allocation of tonnages that might be decided upon at the
                                    present Conference.</p>
                                <p>According to the basis of calculation as submitted by the
                                    Japanese delegation the surface auxiliary strength of the
                                    British Empire would be 472,000 tons.</p>
                                <p>The tonnage allocation suggested by the American delegation in
                                    regard to surface auxiliary vessels is from 450,000 to 550,000
                                    tons for the United States and British Empire, subject to the
                                    intimation that the United States would welcome any proposal for
                                    still lower tonnage levels.</p>
                                <p>Limitation being our main object it would seem to the Japanese
                                    delegation that the adoption in principle of the minimum figure
                                    proposed by the United States delegation as a basis of our
                                    discussion would be a course most conducive to a speedy
                                    consummation of the task before the Conference.</p>
                                <p>If consequently we may take the figure of 450,000 tons for the
                                    United States and British Empire as a basis, the Japanese
                                    delegation would propose for the tonnage to surface auxiliary
                                    vessels to be allotted to Japan a figure of somewhat above
                                    300,000 tons; it being understood that they are quite prepared
                                    at the same time to accept reduced figures in concert with the
                                    other delegations.</p>
                                <p>In addition to this the Japanese delegation desire now to propose
                                    a figure of around 70,000 tons for Japan in respect of
                                    submarines.”</p>

                        <p>65. My No. 64, July 6, 9 p.m. At the conclusion of the statement by
                            Saito, I said that it was gratifying to learn that the proposals made by
                            the Japanese called for low figures for surface craft falling generally
                            within the tonnages originally proposed by the American delegation and
                            that we thought the most careful consideration should be given them.
                            Immediately Lord Cecil, Bridgeman, and Admiral Field began an attack
                            upon the proposals of the Japanese, giving the impression that they
                            deemed it impossible for Great Britain to consider the tonnage advocated
                            by the Japanese. It was pointed out by them that a destroyer tonnage of
                            220,000 tons had been tentatively agreed upon by the technical committee
                            for the United States and Great Britain and that under the Japanese
                            proposals only 230,000 tons of cruisers would be allowed them.</p>
                        <p>Viscount Ishii, in a most emphatic manner, said that the Japanese
                            delegation had come to Geneva to lower naval armaments, and not to
                            increase them, and that he trusted that the Japanese proposals would be
                            accepted as a basis for future discussion by the Conference.</p>
                        <p>As evidently being too remote from the cruiser requirements to merit
                            consideration, the British appeared to be unwilling to participate in
                            any discussion of the Japanese proposals. The idea of a possible treaty
                            to define and limit cruiser-building programs until 1936 was again
                            brought forward by them and it was also suggested by Bridgeman that the
                            possibility of permitting retention without limitation of cruisers
                            exceeding 20 years in age be made the subject of further study. It was
                            agreed that these proposals should be informally considered by experts,
                            but the discussion was not completely finished. The Japanese, both
                            informally and formally, have insisted upon tonnage levels which would
                            represent genuine limitation; and the American delegation is firmly
                            convinced of their sincerity in this regard. It is true their memorandum
                            intimates a desire for an extension of the 5–3 ratio, but it is not far
                            removed from that ratio and it is believed that their figures might be
                            scaled down through appropriate negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Through their fear as to their position in resisting the American and
                            Japanese proposals for low tonnage, the British are attempting to cloud
                            the issue by emphasizing that it is extremely difficult for them to
                            reduce their total tonnage levels when considering our demand for <pb
                                n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0164"/>a large number of cruisers of the
                            10,000-ton class. They endeavored, with some success, several times
                            during this afternoon’s conversation to obtain the Japanese support to
                            their opposition to continued construction of the bigger cruisers. It is
                            evident that the British have no intention of accepting anything along
                            the lines of the Japanese proposals, but it may be the means of making
                            them more reasonable to learn that they stand alone in their demands for
                            a large cruiser tonnage and, with this idea in view, I propose on Friday
                            at the meeting of the executive committee to make a statement that the
                            American delegation is entirely in agreement with the Japanese
                            delegation concerning the general lines to be followed if we expect to
                            achieve any real naval limitation at the present conference.</p>

                        <p>156. Department’s No. 147, July 5, 11 a.m. Nothing could be gained at
                            this time, in my opinion, by approaching either Baldwin or Chamberlain
                            along the lines indicated.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether the figures given at Geneva do really disclose the
                            minimum demand of the British in cruisers, but I am convinced that once
                            that minimum is made known, no considerations of economy will be
                            permitted to interfere with carrying it into effect; in that respect
                            Bridgeman undoubtedly voices the policy of the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>I doubt, moreover, if any pressure here will prove effective; but if you
                            want me to try I suggest that I emphasize following points in event that
                            no agreement is in sight: (1) American people will look upon the very
                            material sacrifices they made to achieve the Washington treaties as
                            having been made in vain; (2) they would assume with reason that the
                            British, instead of seeking limitation, were simply attempting to
                            substitute multitude of small naval units in place of fewer and larger
                            units; (3) American interests, by reason of our lack of naval bases,
                            would be better served through use of larger battle cruisers; (4) in all
                            probability this means scrapping of the Washington treaties in 1931; (5)
                            extent of ill feeling aroused will be incalculable and will no doubt
                            have world-wide effect; (6) among other results <pb n="79"
                                xml:id="pg_79" facs="0165"/>any possibility which now exists of debt
                            settlement revision as far as Great Britain is concerned would be
                            definitely and finally ended. Of course I should merely indicate such
                            arguments as outlined and keep my interview as personal as possible, and
                            I should endeavor to give impression that interview came about because
                            of my personal anxiety over situation. If you approve please advise.</p>
                        <p>As I have said, it is my own belief that the British are working towards
                            a well-matured plan which both Cabinet and Admiralty have already
                            approved and the essentials of which will not be modified. It seems to
                            me that under these circumstances we have but two alternatives: either
                            accept British proposal and content ourselves with insisting upon
                            parity, or try to postpone all action until 1931 when the entire
                            question of naval armament can once again be brought up. If first
                            alternative be chosen I suppose the larger the British demands are the
                            more reasonable will our position appear before the world.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that at present the British Government can put the matter
                            before their people in such a way as to obtain acceptance of their
                            program.</p>
                        <p>If you wish, I shall repeat to Geneva.</p>

                        <p>151. Your No. 156, July 7, noon. It would be useful, I think, for you to
                            try to see either Baldwin or Chamberlain and discuss entire situation in
                            accordance with your six suggestions, except that I should deplore any
                            mention of the debt settlement as open to serious misinterpretation. It
                            seems to me that you also should add that public opinion in the United
                            States is unanimously opposed to idea conveyed by the very extensive
                            British cruiser program and that public opinion here is likely to see in
                            that program a threat to this country, as there can be no other power
                            against whom Great Britain would feel necessity of protecting herself to
                            the extent she seeks, and as any projected treaty would include
                            safeguard clause which would make possible examination of treaty for
                            revision in the event of threatening building programs by any other
                            powers.</p>

                        <p>68. Mr. Saburi, of the Japanese delegation, called on me this evening to
                            inform me that Viscount Saito intended to submit to the executive
                            committee meeting on Friday the Japanese proposals reported in my
                            telegram No. 64 of July 6. He wished to impress on me the fact that the
                            Japanese were entirely sincere in their desire to arrive at an agreement
                            that would approximate the lower figures for tonnage contained in the
                            original American proposals; that substantial increases from those
                            figures would necessitate large building programs, and that Saito, with
                            the approval of his Government, had decided to abandon the Conference
                            rather than go back to Japan with any agreement which would add to the
                            burden of taxation. He stated that the Japanese delegation would make
                            this aspect of the situation absolutely clear.</p>
                        <p>Should the Japanese delegation remain inflexible, I doubt very much that
                            the British would be willing to reduce their figures to a degree
                            sufficient to enable any agreement to be brought about.</p>

                        <p>69. Should there be absolute inability to agree and consequent breaking
                            up of the Conference in spite of our sincere endeavors to arrive at an
                            agreement, it is important that we should not be unprepared to deal with
                            the situation thus created; and should this eventuality occur, we have,
                            after careful study, worked out the following line of action which we
                            beg to submit for your consideration:</p>
                        <p>Should the closing of the Conference become inevitable as a result of the
                            uncompromising stand of Great Britain in the matter of vastly increased
                            cruiser tonnage, we would suggest, in the first place, a private <pb
                                n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0167"/>conversation with the chief
                            delegates in order to bring out strongly the fact that the promotion of
                            good understanding between Great Britain, Japan, and ourselves
                            constituted the basic object of the President in convening the
                            Conference; that such an understanding was to the highest interests of
                            all of us and that no other factors should permit us to forget this;
                            that therefore a public session be held to give out frankly and
                            impartially the news of the breaking up of the Conference; and that each
                            delegation should be free to set forth in any manner it pleased its own
                            particular difficulties and the reasons which rendered the agreement
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>Should this procedure be acceptable, I would, with your approval, repeat
                            in the strongest terms the basic wish of the United States to foster
                            amity between the three powers and our disinclination to permit our
                            friendly relations to be in any way diminished by the failure to reach
                            an accord at Geneva; that if our respective viewpoints were published in
                            an amicable way so that the questions could be studied in the coming
                            four years by public opinion which might assist in finding an answer
                            thereto, the Conference would not have been held in vain; that the
                            opinion of our delegation was that a basic divergence in our concept of
                            maritime armaments and not a mere difference of opinion as to technical
                            matters was the cause of our inability to agree; that we believe the
                            naval necessities of one country to be conditioned upon the strength of
                            other nations, whereas the British consider maritime requirements to be
                            absolute and not proportioned upon the armaments of other powers; that
                            no Conference would in our view be necessary should the British
                            conception be correct, since, according to it, each nation would decide
                            upon its own absolute requirements and no abatement or reconsideration
                            of these needs could be entertained; that our view, however, of relative
                            naval requirements, in which the Japanese concur, permits a mutual
                            downward revision so far as possible with proper regard to the fleets of
                            those powers not party to the treaty and that it was upon the cruiser
                            tonnage level that our insistence lay. The strength maintained by any
                            one of the three powers concerned would necessitate readjustments by the
                            other powers in corresponding measure; that viewed from this standpoint,
                            the insistence of the British delegation upon high levels of tonnage in
                            cruisers would revise our needs automatically upward to such an extent
                            that no real limitation would be achieved but, rather, should a treaty
                            result, a program of naval expansion would be legalized; that while the
                            American delegation would be glad to sign a treaty which could be
                            defended as providing for limitation, it was our opinion that it would
                            be more honest to the American people and to the world, and more likely
                            to promote intelligent consideration of naval questions, to dissolve the
                            Conference <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0168"/>without arriving at an
                            accord rather than to reach an agreement providing for a limitation
                            which would not be genuine.</p>
                        <p>We should be able in conclusion to evidence a proper appreciation of the
                            attitude maintained by the different delegates during the Conference and
                            could indicate the hope that those views which all of them had set forth
                            would in any event bring about the stimulation of our different nations
                            to view in a friendly manner each other’s problems and to work out some
                            equitable and sensible limitation or reduction of naval armaments before
                            the 1931 Conference.</p>

                                afford opportunity for mature consideration of existing proposals as
                                well as for sober reflection on part of all the Governments

                            <item>If Conference fails and public meeting is called for purpose of
                                permitting each delegation to state its position, or, should no
                                public meeting be called and each delegation is left to make its
                                position public, the Department believes you should make full
                                statement of position of this Government. General statement you
                                propose is well enough as far as it goes, but the Department
                                believes that you should emphasize point that the President called
                                Conference for purpose of limitation of armament, not to lay
                                foundation for worldwide naval expansion. It is all right to lay
                                emphasis on fact that a favorable outcome of Conference would
                                enhance good feeling among the three countries parties to it and
                                would create favorable impression throughout world, but I do not
                                think that this was fundamental purpose back of calling Conference,
                                which <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0169"/>was, rather, to obtain
                                a reasonable limitation on naval construction and to prevent
                                competition. If the only powers which have considerable navies are
                                willing to make reasonable limitations, the United States is not
                                able to understand why the British Government finds it necessary to
                                create so large a sea force when the United States and Japan are the
                                only countries against which there is any necessity for building
                                large navies. Neither British safety, nor British trade routes, nor
                                British foreign possessions could possibly be endangered by navy of
                                any other power, and should any other power start a building program
                                of proportions to constitute a danger, the treaty would contain
                                clause protecting not only Great Britain but any other signatory
                                power.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I suggest also that you consider wisdom of including in your statement
                            mention that the British accepted Secretary Hughes’ proposition at
                            Washington Conference in 1921 for limitation of 450,000 tons on both
                            cruisers and destroyers (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of Washington
                                Conference on Limitation of Armament</hi>, pp. 86 and 100). The
                            Department is utterly unable to understand why, five years later, there
                            is any justification for a cruiser tonnage which alone exceeds this
                            combined figure. If result of Conference cannot be fairly interpreted by
                            world opinion as self-denying ordinance entered into freely by the great
                            naval powers, it then possesses no value whatever and will do endless
                            harm. If the three great naval powers are unwilling to make concessions
                            in order to stop competitive construction in sea forces, what can be
                            expected of the other countries? The example to the lesser powers would
                            certainly be very unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>Great stress is being laid by British press on view that Great Britain
                            has proposed great economies through reduction of size and extension of
                            life of battleships; but no mention is made of fact that no economy can
                            result from any agreement on that score before 1931. I offer suggestion
                            that it might be well to state that the United States had been willing
                            to discuss with the other two powers at this Conference a program of
                            reduction in size and of extension of life of battleships in 1931, but
                            that as all the parties to the Washington treaty are not present and as
                            no country can build any new battleships until after 1931, it would be
                            useless to hold Conference for that purpose at present. Certainly, the
                            increased building program of cruisers and the cost of their maintenance
                            would more than offset any possible economies in battleships. If
                            regrettable position is reached that Conference must be abandoned,
                            careful consideration should be given to any statement to be made and
                            time allowed for its consideration at Department and by President.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is to assist you in preparing a statement to be submitted
                            here for approval.</p>

                        <p>157. Department’s No. 151, July 7, 4 p.m. I saw Chamberlain at noon
                            today, making it clear to him that I had come on my personal
                            responsibility since I believed that it was my duty to acquaint him with
                            the unfavorable impression created by the British naval proposals in the
                            United States. I stated that while the change of sentiment there could
                            not be forecast, there was a growing fear lest sacrifices made at
                            Washington with regard to naval bases and ships had been in vain; and
                            said that the belief appeared to be increasing that Great Britain was
                            now endeavoring to return to her dominant position, after having
                            succeeded in limiting the size of battleships, by constructing a
                            quantity of small ships which were suited to her needs but not to ours.
                            I encountered a most sympathetic attitude on the part of Chamberlain,
                            who set forth the causes for the present position taken by Great Britain
                            and stated that the tonnage demanded was based upon careful calculations
                            which had been favorably passed upon by three succeeding governments of
                            different parties. In reply I indicated that while I recognized their
                            duty and right to provide for ships which might be necessary, I felt
                            nevertheless that since the German fleet had virtually disappeared and
                            other nations were unable financially to provide for extensive building
                            programs, it was difficult to see the necessity for so great an increase
                            in British tonnage at this time, especially since treaty stipulations
                            would meet any necessity which might arise by reason of an important
                            building program on the part of any other nation. I then asked
                            Chamberlain whether, under any conceivable circumstances, Great Britain
                            could regard America as an enemy and received a vehement answer in the
                            negative, together with a statement that any war between America and the
                            British Empire would inevitably lead to the disintegration of the
                            latter. In the subsequent discussion of a possible program Chamberlain
                            made the complaint that whenever an offer was advanced by the British to
                            reduce total tonnage the American representatives insisted that the
                            United States would build only cruisers of a large size. He said further
                            that Great Britain had already conceded equality in ratio but was unable
                            to yield in the matter of permitting superiority in large cruisers to be
                            established by the United States. In answering this objection I <pb
                                n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0171"/>stated that, while I was unable
                            to speak authoritatively, the assumption that if a low enough total
                            tonnage were agreed upon the adjustment of classes of cruisers should
                            not present any insuperable difficulty seemed to me mere common sense.
                            At the end of our conversation Chamberlain expressed his thanks and
                            indicated that the gravity of the situation was fully appreciated by him
                            and that, while not hopeful, he would at once consult Baldwin and Lord
                                Balfour.<note n="55a" xml:id="d84fn55a">Arthur James, Lord Balfour,
                                Lord President of the Council; Lord Balfour was head of the British
                                delegation at the Washington Conference on the Limitation of
                                Armament, 1921–1922.</note> He added that within a day or two he
                            would see me again. Any further developments will, of course, be fully
                            reported to you.</p>
                        <p>By reason of my talk with Chamberlain, I am again impressed with the fact
                            that a very mature and carefully worked out plan is being followed by
                            the British delegates at Geneva. Nevertheless, I am certain that what I
                            said about the effect of British proposals on the people of the United
                            States, as well as on the other peoples of the world, did not fail to
                            impress Chamberlain. I believe that should it be possible to keep total
                            tonnage under 400,000 tons it will be regarded in London, and should be
                            regarded by us, as a material concession to the American views. I
                            venture to suggest that our own representatives do nothing meanwhile to
                            weaken the position taken by me.</p>

                        <p>158. Last evening I received the following communication from
                            Chamberlain: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    close attention which it required.</p>
                                <p>We are at this moment expecting further telegrams of great
                                    importance from our delegation at Geneva which may have a very
                                    important bearing on the points you and I discussed. We must,
                                    therefore, await them before taking any decision. It is possible
                                    that they may require personal consultation with the
                                    representatives and that we may, therefore, have to ask for a
                                    short adjournment at Geneva, but I hope in any case to be in a
                                    position to make a further communication to you on Monday.</p>

                                <p>We greatly appreciate the friendly feelings which inspired your
                                    initiative. We, ourselves, are much concerned at the course
                                    which the public discussion of these questions has taken and we
                                    shall, you may be sure, do anything we can to find a solution on
                                    which all can agree.”</p>

                        <p>His Majesty’s Ambassador has been desired by His Majesty’s Principal
                            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make the following
                            communication to the Secretary of State in explanation of the attitude
                            adopted by His Majesty’s Government at the Three Power Naval Conference
                            now proceeding at Geneva. This communication is practically identical
                            with that which was made two days ago at Geneva by Mr. Bridgeman, First
                            Lord of the Admiralty, to the American Delegation.<note n="56"

                        <p>His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain has always sympathized with
                            President Coolidge’s desire to carry out yet further work of naval
                            disarmament which was begun at Washington in 1921–1922 with such happy
                            results. Geneva Conference was therefore begun under fortunate auspices
                            and has, so far as His Majesty’s Government are able to judge, been
                            doing much valuable work. But they note with regret that in certain
                            quarters their policy has been misunderstood and in consequence
                            misrepresented.</p>
                        <p>The essential principles accepted at the Washington Conference referred
                            only to capital ships and aircraft carriers: and with regard to these it
                            was agreed between three leading naval Powers that they would accept for
                            a period of at least ten years certain limitations as to numbers,
                            armament, tonnage and replacement.</p>
                        <p>If the Washington policy is now to be extended it can only be in one or
                            both of two ways. The cost of capital ships may be still further reduced
                            and limitations may be devised in respect of vessels other than capital
                            ships—i. e., vessels about which the Treaty of Washington is silent. On
                            both of these possible lines of advance the British delegation was
                            instructed to lay suggestions before the Conference.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the first of them, however, they desire to say nothing at
                            the present moment. In deference to what they understand to be the
                            desire of the Conference they reserve their proposals until a later
                            stage. His Majesty’s Government do not think these proposals <pb n="87"
                                xml:id="pg_87" facs="0173"/>are likely to occasion any serious
                            difficulty, but it is clear it is under this head that the most
                            important economies may be anticipated. The questions raised by any
                            proposal to limit the number of cruisers are of a more complex
                            character. The suggestions of His Majesty’s Government are broadly as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>They propose to divide cruisers into two classes—heavy and light; and to
                            adopt for heavy class the same principles as those adopted at Washington
                            in the case of capital ships. They think, in other words, that their
                            size and armament might with advantage be limited and that the numbers
                            permitted to each treaty power should be in the Washington ratio.</p>
                        <p>This seems to His Majesty’s Government to be a reasonable application of
                            an accepted principle to the case of heavy cruisers. But when light
                            cruisers come to be considered wholly different conditions must be taken
                            into account.</p>
                        <p>It is of course true that a fleet of a given size requires auxiliary
                            vessels of a given number whatever may be the position of the country to
                            which the fleet belongs or seas in which it is required to operate. On
                            this point there need be no dispute. But in addition to these auxiliary
                            vessels cruisers are required by all maritime countries to perform
                            duties quite unconnected with organized fleets and by no country so much
                            as by the British Empire.</p>
                        <p>Special position is of course due to a geographical subdivision which has
                            no parallel in history. In times of peace small difficulties and
                            disorders wholly without international significance which in states
                            differently situated would be dealt with by police or a frontier guard
                            may often make it necessary to send cruisers. In times of war the
                            insular position of Great Britain and the seas which divide it from its
                            colonies and from self-governing communities with which it is associated
                            within the Empire present even greater difficulties—difficulties not
                            always present to the imagination of those who live and think in terms
                            of great continents. During the Washington Conference this point was
                            dealt with by Mr. Balfour in words which it may be worth while to
                                recall.<note n="57" xml:id="d86fn57">For text of Mr. Balfour’s

                                Government Printing Office, 1922), pp. 96 ff.</note> “Most of my
                            audience (he said) are citizens of the United States. The United States
                            stands solid, impregnable, self-sufficient, all its essential lines of
                            communication completely protected from any conceivable hostile
                            attack.</p>

                            is not merely that you are the wealthiest country in the world; it is
                            that configuration of your country is such that you are wholly immune
                            from particular perils to which from nature of the case the British
                            Empire is subject.</p>

                        <p>“Suppose for example that your Western States were suddenly removed ten
                            thousand miles across the sea. Suppose that the very heart of your
                            Empire was a small and crowded island depending upon overseas trade, not
                            merely for its luxuries, but for the raw material of those manufacturers
                                [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] by which its superabundant population
                            lives and for the food upon which they subsist. Suppose that it was a
                            familiar thought that there was never a moment of the year when within
                            the limits of your state there was more than seven week’s food for its
                            population and that food could only be replenished by overseas
                            communication. If you will draw this picture and if you will realize all
                            that it implies you will understand why it is that no citizen of the
                            British Empire, whether he be drawn from the far Dominions of the
                            Pacific or lives in a small island in the North Sea, can ever forget
                            that it is by sea communication that he lives and that without the sea
                            communication he and the Empire to which he belongs would perish
                            together.”</p>
                        <p>How can an Empire thus situated voluntarily surrender its right to live?
                            How can it abandon by formal treaty the possibility of cooperation in
                            mutual defence between communities which owe a common allegiance though
                            divided from each other by all oceans.</p>
                        <p>These are considerations which may surely appeal to all. Yet it has been
                            stated that the objection felt to surrender of the liberty to construct
                            a fleet required by the special conditions of the British Empire is due,
                            not to inevitable necessities of self-defence, but to an arrogant desire
                            for maritime superiority. Great Britain, it has been said, refuses
                            “parity” to the United States. The statement has already been formally
                            contradicted. It is wholly without foundation. What are the facts? The
                            President of the United States has invited the British Government to
                            take part in a conference summoned to diminish the burden of naval
                            armaments. They gladly responded to the call. They accept the principle
                            announced by Mr. Gibson (who presides over the Conference) the principle
                            “that the navies should be maintained at the lowest level compatible
                            with national security”. They do not dispute the right of the United
                            States to build cruisers in numbers sufficient to secure this object,
                            but they cannot surrender a similar right for themselves. It is their
                            manifest interest to build no more than they must; it is not less their
                            duty and their intention to promote the world’s desire for a diminution
                            of armaments. They do not for a moment suppose the United States, which
                            has summoned the Conference to further this great ideal, will ever be
                            influenced in their naval policy by any motive but desire for national
                            security or that in their estimate of naval requirements of different
                            states the geographical considerations will be ignored.</p>

                        <p>78. Bridgeman suggested to me that we have a private conversation to
                            discuss political and nontechnical phases of our work with a view to
                            seeing whether we could open any avenues for investigation by technical
                            experts. As I wished to explore every method of discussion I readily
                            agreed; and, accompanied by Dulles, I met privately today with Bridgeman
                            and Cecil, Saito and Ishii.</p>
                        <p>Cecil suggested as a possible way out of the impasse regarding cruisers
                            that we should study building programs between now and 1931 which would
                            control completed cruiser tonnage as over 1934. Bridgeman indicated that
                            they would be prepared to abandon their projected program of 10,000-ton
                            8-inch[gun?] vessels and perhaps stop work on one vessel just commenced
                            in the hope that no further vessels of this character would be
                            constructed, that of course we should be accorded the full liberty of
                            constructing 10,000-ton vessels up to the number which they might have
                            completed under present plans by 1934. As I interpret this suggestion
                            the British would complete seven vessels of the 10,000-ton <hi
                                rend="italic">Kent</hi> class and three or four vessels of the <hi
                                rend="italic">London</hi> class and that their other 10,000-ton
                            cruiser program would <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0176"/>be
                            abandoned. Cecil and Bridgeman indicated that their building program,
                            including 1931, could be restricted within 400,000 tons and foresaw the
                            possibility that such a limit might be possible for a treaty which would
                            terminate in 1934. They emphasized that the 1931 Conference would in any
                            event deal with the whole subject and that if we now provided for
                            programs between now and 1931 we would have met the problem particularly
                            confronting us.</p>
                        <p>I indicated that while I was not in a position to pass on this suggestion
                            our naval experts would study it, and pointed out that in the last
                            analysis building programs must be translated into total tonnages and
                            that we could not profitably discuss anything over 400,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>Ishii indicated that they were planning eight 10,000-ton vessels but
                            could eliminate one of these vessels not yet laid down in the event that
                            the United States and Great Britain agreed within this period that they
                            would not lay down or complete more than the eleven contemplated by the
                            British.</p>
                        <p>While the foregoing may offer a way out of the cruiser dilemma it will
                            not represent any very real limitation, although it may represent
                            renunciation on the part of Great Britain of the construction of further
                            10,000-ton 8-inch [-gun?] vessels and give us freedom to build up to
                            them in this class without restriction as to the future. The British
                            have not at any time indicated a willingness to limit their final total
                            tonnage to less than 465[,000] in 1936 and ultimately to over 550,000
                            tons.</p>
                        <p>As I felt that Bridgeman in the Monday plenary session would probably try
                            to throw upon us the onus for impeding the work of the Conference by
                            insistence upon twenty-five 10,000-ton vessels, I told him that the
                            number of such vessels would be subject to negotiation provided that
                            this would render it possible for them to bring their total needs to
                            figures which constituted a real limitation. I emphasized that Great
                            Britain was far in the lead in the construction of 10,000-ton vessels
                            and had set the pace and that it was futile to talk of the reduction in
                            the number of such vessels as long as they either had or were about to
                            acquire a large number of vessels of this character.</p>
                        <p>I report the foregoing to show the efforts which are being made here to
                            fortify [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a way out of the cruiser impasse
                            and I have not abandoned hope that a solution may be reached. The
                            Japanese delegates this afternoon gave no indication as to whether they
                            were prepared to revise upward their total tonnage figures for cruisers
                            so as to make negotiation between the British and Japanese possible.</p>
                        <p>Captain Egerton of British delegation and Captain Toyoda of Japanese
                            delegation this evening called on Admiral Schofield for informal
                            discussion of cruiser problem. Captain Egerton proposed as a possible
                            solution a building program as to vessels laid down between <pb n="91"
                                xml:id="pg_91" facs="0177"/>now and 1931 for each of the three
                            powers as a means of escaping the present apparent impasse. Both he and
                            Captain Toyoda agreed that on the basis of total tonnage limitation or
                            limitation by numbers there was no possibility of reconciling the
                            Japanese and British theses or of reconciling our thesis with the
                            British inasmuch as the British requirements translated into total
                            tonnage reach 465[,000] tons in 1936 and the Japanese approximate
                            maximum tonnage in combined destroyer and cruiser classes for themselves
                            for the same period is 310,000 tons. Both Captain Egerton and Captain
                            Toyoda said that they were stating their views but could not be
                            considered as binding their delegates.</p>

                        <p>80. Late last evening I received a letter from Mr. Bridgeman as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“You and your colleagues will by this time have looked into the
                                    question of an agreed program of cruiser construction as a basis
                                    for arriving at a settlement sufficiently to form an idea
                                    whether or not it gives a hopeful prospect of success.</p>
                                <p>Both you and Viscount Ishii expressed some doubts as to the
                                    wisdom of having a plenary session tomorrow though you both
                                    kindly gave way to my desire for an opportunity of explaining,
                                    as I hope to be able to explain, the British position more
                                    fully.</p>
                                <p>But if your chief delegates and those of Japan are able to say
                                    that you think the new scheme holds out real prospects of
                                    success I should be willing to postpone my statement of the
                                    British case for a day or two so as to admit of the possibility
                                    of being able to come to the plenary conference with some agreed
                                    policy.</p>
                                <p>I called on Viscount Ishii this morning and he hoped to be able
                                    to give me his reply this evening. Should you be able to do the
                                    same and both answers were distinctly hopeful I would ask you to
                                    postpone this plenary session if you think fit.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>For explanation of first paragraph of Bridgeman’s letter see my 78, July
                            9, 11 a.m.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] Previously, when Viscount Ishii and I objected to calling a
                            plenary session, stating that we considered it wisest to discuss our
                            divergent views in private session and then announce to the public our
                            decision, Bridgeman, you will recall, insisted upon a plenary session.
                            Only upon his statement that he desired that the British views be given
                            at a plenary session did Viscount Ishii and I agree to this. Under these
                            circumstances, I considered that <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0178"
                            />the responsibility for calling off the meeting should be placed upon
                            Bridgeman and not upon the American or Japanese delegations. Therefore,
                            I sent the following reply to Mr. Bridgeman, after consulting Saburi,
                            who was entirely of my opinion: [End paraphrase.] <quote

                                <p>As I stated yesterday afternoon, I should be glad [to] explore
                                    any possible method of meeting our present difficulty with
                                    regard to the cruiser question. Frankly, as you will understand,
                                    there has not been sufficient time to determine whether the
                                    methods discussed yesterday afternoon, and also between our
                                    experts, will hold out a substantial hope of settling our
                                    present problem. For that reason I hesitate to hazard an opinion
                                    with regard to your suggestion of delaying tomorrow’s meeting on
                                    this account.</p>

                                    decision and I would only suggest that you send word this
                                    evening to Hugh Wilson in order that he may know whether to
                                    continue preparations for tomorrow or to cancel the orders which
                                    have been given and notify the various delegates accordingly. As
                                    I say, I shall readily abide by any decision you may reach.”</p>

                        <p>[Paraphrase.] While no reply was addressed to me last night by Bridgeman,
                            he intimated that he was desirous of consulting Cecil and the various
                            Dominion delegations this morning. … I understand that there was a
                            divergence of opinion among the British delegation and that postponement
                            of the meeting had been urged upon Bridgeman by his own associates. [End

                        <p>The morning papers carry the news of the assassination in Dublin of Mr.

                            this Conference, who had only recently participated in our work here. I
                            therefore immediately sent word to Mr. Bridgeman that, in view of this
                            tragic event, I, as President of the Conference, suggested, if Mr.
                            Bridgeman approved, a postponement of the plenary session. Mr. Bridgeman
                            replied by letter as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Sir Esme Howard said it seemed clear that someone in American delegation
                            had been giving out alleged facts and that such an article could only
                            result in causing intense feeling in Great Britain to degree that might
                            break up Conference.</p>
                        <p>Howard was informed that undoubtedly writer of the article had knowledge
                            of naval matters which he interpreted as he pleased, and that it was
                            most improbable that anyone in the American delegation, in face of
                            repeated statements by officials of the Government of the United States
                            that all nations concerned had loyally fulfilled terms of the treaty of
                            Washington, would have made any of the alleged assertions.</p>
                        <p>Howard added that majority of articles published under Williams’
                            signature were, in his opinion, provocative and many times written for

                        <p>100. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called me into conference today and
                            asked me to transmit to Washington his earnest desire for a successful
                            result of Geneva Conference and his strong feeling that the situation
                            had reached the stage where the action of the delegates should be guided
                            more by political considerations and less by technical ideas. He was
                            afraid that the present outlook was more in the direction of expansion
                            of armament than limitation and if the Conference resulted in any such
                            agreement he knew that the people of Japan would not approve it and he
                            believed it would not be approved by the people either of the United
                            States or Great Britain. He said the people of Japan were strongly in
                            favor of limitation of naval armament, both because of their desire for
                            peaceful relations with the United States and other nations and also for
                            economic reasons, as they desired to limit their own expenditure on
                            naval armaments as far as consistent with safety. The Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs therefore begged me to ask the good offices of my
                            Government in assisting the Japanese in bringing about some agreement
                            which will not call for material increases in naval armaments. I stated
                            that I would transmit his views to my Government but would be glad to
                            know whether the most effective means for bringing about the desired
                            result would not be to persuade the British to act in the same direction
                            and he agreed that this was so and thought that this possibly could be
                            done by a common attitude on the part of the United States and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conference he reiterated his desire that I should
                            impress upon my Government his feeling that this matter should now be
                            taken up from a political standpoint rather than a technical naval
                            standpoint.</p>

                        <p>81. After postponement of plenary session I called this morning on
                            Viscount Ishii to discuss several matters. Among others I urged him to
                            indicate clearly both to us and to British how far the British would
                            have to come down to reach a level which would afford a <pb n="95"
                                xml:id="pg_95" facs="0181"/>profitable basis of discussion to
                            Japanese. Ishii stated that he had this morning informed Bridgeman in
                            definite terms that the Japanese were practically rigid on figure of
                            450,000 tons for cruisers and destroyers combined for United States and
                            Great Britain. Ishii said that Japanese delegation felt very strongly on
                            subject; they were quite willing at present moment to return home
                            without an agreement, if necessary, but that they were not willing to
                            conclude agreement which would call for program of naval expansion.</p>
                        <p>Bridgeman called on me after lunch in a much more conciliatory mood than
                            he has shown heretofore. He said that he felt a plenary session on
                            Thursday was needed in order to state British position as he was under
                            serious home criticism on account of the general misrepresentation of
                            the British attitude abroad. Bridgeman assured me that he would confine
                            himself to statement of British case and would take no action which
                            could be considered provocative. He would ask no questions or he might
                            ask certain general questions which would not be embarrassing and which
                            I could answer or not as I chose. I said that I thought this was the
                            preferable way when we were endeavoring to arrive at a working
                            agreement, but that if he set pace I was quite ready for plain talking.
                            I told him that I thought it was regrettable that we should consume both
                            our time and energy in trying to find a common British-American basis of
                            agreement if, after we reached it, it was not acceptable to the
                            Japanese, and that we ought to have clearly understood what levels would
                            prove acceptable to the Japanese; once there was agreement between
                            British and Japanese on tonnage levels it would probably not be
                            difficult for us to make agreement complete. Bridgeman replied that
                            Anglo-Japanese agreement would present no difficulty as the Japanese
                            would come up to the, British figures, only they would demand a <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> and he had not yet been able to
                            ascertain from them what it would be. I said that Viscount Ishii had
                            stressed fact that Japanese would rather have no agreement than to
                            revise materially their figures but Bridgeman said he did not regard
                            that seriously.</p>
                        <p>Later on in day Saburi of the Japanese delegation came to see me. I asked
                            him if his delegation had fully impressed on the British the fact that
                            Japanese were in earnest about their tonnage levels figures. Saburi said
                            that they had, and he repeated that the Japanese would rather go home
                            without an agreement than materially to revise these figures upward. He
                            then added significant remark that if our delegation could reach
                            agreement with British on high tonnage level and cared to conclude a
                            treaty with them, no objection would be offered by Japan but that she
                            should not care to become a party to such a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Delegation feels that our efforts now should be directed to concentrating
                            attention on need for finding common ground for agreement <pb n="96"
                                xml:id="pg_96" facs="0182"/>between Japanese and British, and
                            emphasizing consistently our preference for Japanese levels. Unless the
                            two extreme positions can be reconciled, and until they are reconciled,
                            British-American negotiation is fruitless. At present our delegation
                            proposes to make a British-Japanese agreement our objective, and we feel
                            that you may wish to impress on both the other parties to this
                            Conference the necessity for their finding common ground for
                            discussion.</p>

                        <p>84. Your No. 41, July 11, 6 p.m. The Wythe Williams article was founded
                            on pure conjecture as we had no intention of referring to question of
                            overtonnage of capital ships in plenary session or anywhere else. As far
                            as I am aware we have no mass of documents on subject of capital ship
                            tonnage, though the British themselves circulated a confidential
                            document containing figures. Correspondents have discussed the figures
                            referred to from time Conference began. I now learn that they were
                            published last January in <hi rend="italic">Gallic American</hi> by
                            William Baldwin Shearer. I am able to say that the members of the
                            American delegation have been most scrupulous in not revealing
                            confidential information to press and in refusing to discuss committee
                            proceedings or proposals of other delegations.</p>
                        <p>Only statements that either Admiral Jones or I have made which could bear
                            in any way on this subject have been to effect that signatories of
                            treaty of Washington have scrupulously observed its provisions.</p>

                        <p>42. The press in this country has several times reported from English
                            sources statements similar to that which appeared Sunday, July 10, in
                                <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, as follows:<note n="59"

                                <p>“According to the reports received here (i. e. London) the
                                    official American experts at Geneva have been strongly
                                    reinforced by unofficial representatives of great concerns whose
                                    probable interests lie in the direction of contracts for steel
                                    plants and other indispensable concomitants of a big navy. Much
                                    of the pugnacious spirit in which reports to the American press
                                    from Geneva have been conceived is attributed here to the
                                    activities of these unofficial propagandists.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Does statement that representatives of steel plants or manufacturing
                            concerns are in Geneva or are interfering in any way with deliberations
                            contain any truth?</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> also has an editorial based on
                            British information that the United States, Great Britain, and Japan
                            would have been saved $750,000,000 through British extension of age
                            limit alone, and that reduction on the size of cruisers would have been
                            a great saving. The first statement is, of course, absurd, and second is
                            wholly inaccurate unless total tonnage is reduced; cost of building
                            small cruisers is more proportionately than to build large ones, and
                            they cost more to maintain. These points should be borne in mind in
                            event of statements at plenary session or at any other time, in your
                            judgment, when press statements are given out.</p>

                        <p>162. My 158, July 9, 10 a.m. Chamberlain asked me to meet him last night
                            at the House of Commons. He told me he had conferred with Baldwin,
                            Balfour and Beatty<note n="60" xml:id="d95fn60">Admiral of the Fleet
                                David Beatty, Earl Beatty of the North Sea and of Brooksby.</note>
                            yesterday morning and again late yesterday afternoon. Their reports from
                            Geneva he said were not complete but he thought a reasonable hope of
                            agreement still existed.</p>
                        <p>Chamberlain then went on to explain the differences as he saw them
                            between the British and American demands and concluded by saying that
                            there seemed to be almost insuperable difficulties in a three-power
                            negotiation in getting an agreement on a ratio of total tonnage based on
                            the theoretical needs of each. As an effort to surmount this difficulty
                            his Government offered the following suggestion: <quote

                                    on lines of an agreement as to total in each class beyond which
                                    each party would not go up to 1936, to wit, date of expiration
                                    of Washington treaty at which time whole subject must again be
                                    considered. If the United States Government approve this
                                    suggestion and will issue [instructions to] Mr. Gibson to seek

                            political as well as from technical angle there has been set up by

                            Following discussion took place:</p>
                        <p>British indicated willingness to study cruiser-building programs and, as

                            we insisted on the basis of 10, they would scrap 3 on which work was
                            just starting. We indicated we conceived a limitation of building
                            programs as one method of arriving at a definite total tonnage during
                            the life of the treaty and not as an end in itself and asked British to
                            explain how, on any of foregoing bases respecting 10,000-ton vessels,
                            they would come within 400,000 tons in 1936. British explained that they
                            had received new instructions from London to reduce their number of
                            cruisers from 75 to 66 and if necessary to fix a maximum of 6,000 tons
                            for other than 10,000-ton vessels. On this basis and assuming only 10 or
                            12 new 10,000-ton cruisers constructed, they could accept a total
                            tonnage limitation of about 400,000 tons for 1936. If we desire a larger
                            number of 10,000-ton vessels the total tonnage would be correspondingly
                            raised or it would be necessary to have the treaty end in 1934.</p>
                        <p>We suggested that real difficulty in our discussions was caused by
                            British effort to force other navies to accept same standard of type as
                            themselves even though conditions vary and we felt that if we could get
                            away from this insistence on their part, rapid progress could be made.
                            We felt that it was most unlikely that any program of construction would
                            be adopted by the United States which Great Britain could consider as a
                            menace even though full liberty were given to the construction of
                            10,000-ton cruisers within a reasonable total tonnage limitation. It was
                            tentatively suggested that if the British really feared such a
                            contingency it might be possible to cover this by an article
                            contemplating the case of a building program of powers not party to new
                            treaty; such an article might provide that if at any time any of the
                            powers considered their safety threatened by the building programs in
                            10,000-ton vessels by any of the contracting parties a Conference should
                            be called and if agreement not reached reasonable provision be made for
                            termination of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>It was stated frankly to the British and Japanese that in our opinion we
                            were now in a position where we might be able to find basis of agreement
                            with either the British or the Japanese but that no one had yet
                            suggested a basis on which those two powers could get together; that
                            naturally we preferred the Japanese basis which corresponded closely to
                            our own.</p>

                        <p>In the discussion between the British and Japanese which followed, the
                            British seemed surprised at the firm stand the Japanese took on a total
                            tonnage limitation for all surface craft of 450,000 for the United
                            States and Great Britain, and British again reiterated that this was
                            entirely unacceptable to them.</p>

                        <p>83. Group mentioned my 82, July 12, 8 p.m., continued discussion today.
                            Upon examination of Japanese tonnage in surface craft including tonnage
                            under construction or projected it was found that this would total
                            approximately 315,000 tons. On basis 5–5–3 ratio this would give 525,000
                            tons of cruisers and destroyers for the United States and the British
                            Empire. British representatives indicated that they felt that this total
                            tonnage of 525,000 for the United States and Great Britain and 315,000
                            for Japan held out some hope of offering a basis for negotiation and
                            said that they would investigate whether there were any conditions under
                            which they could accept it. This afternoon they produced the following

                        <p>The Japanese when they saw that British had raised the figures
                            tentatively suggested in the morning said that proposals were
                            unacceptable and immediately reverted to the discussion of 450,000 tons
                            for the United States and Great Britain. Saburi added that Viscount
                            Saito had said to him that of course if Great Britain and the United
                            States wish to reach an agreement along the lines indicated Japan <pb
                                n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0187"/>would be happy to see it but
                            could not go to any such tonnage figures as proposed.</p>
                        <p>As you will appreciate, the suggestion quoted above is highly
                            unacceptable to us in many particulars, particularly in fixing the limit
                            of one class of cruisers at 6,000 tons. Further, the scheme of retaining
                            vessels over the low age limits proposed by the Japanese while ingenious
                            is really nothing more than a disguised attempt to increase total
                            tonnage. However, a slight advance has been made in that the British
                            even with unacceptable provisos proposed to consider tonnage figures
                            considerably below what they have heretofore been discussing.</p>
                        <p>In all combined tonnage of surface craft we of course make it clear that
                            it would be necessary to separate cruiser and destroyer class in any
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>Discussions described in my July 12, 8 p.m., and in this telegram were
                            entirely informal and are not in any sense binding upon any of the
                            delegations. The results of these meetings will however shortly be
                            considered by the delegates to see whether they offer any possible way
                            out of the difficulty.</p>

                        <p>159. Your No. 162, July 12, noon. I am in entire agreement with
                            Chamberlain not to attempt to fix for all time maximum overhead tonnage
                            based on theoretical needs, but to limit agreement to total tonnage in
                            each class beyond which, up to the date on which Washington treaty can
                            be terminated, namely 1936, each party should not build. The whole
                            subject can be reconsidered in 1931, under the Washington treaty.</p>
                        <p>By each class, I assume that Chamberlain means cruisers, destroyers and
                            submarines. Our delegation already has instructions along these lines as
                            they are basis of our original proposal. I am sure that our delegation
                            has not failed to make clear in some way during Conference necessity for
                            our having 10,000-ton cruisers in view of long cruising radius which is
                            necessitated by lack of naval bases, a fact which affects capacity to
                            carry sufficient defensive armor and armament. The 7,500-ton cruiser is
                            not the most useful type to the United States for the reason that to
                            obtain cruising radius without <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0188"
                            />naval bases, armor must be sacrificed and if equipped with 6-inch guns
                            the smaller cruiser is approximately on parity with a converted
                            merchantman, a class of vessel of which the United States has relatively
                            few.</p>
                        <p>The United States does not object to smaller-size ships for Great Britain
                            if the latter deems them necessary to her needs, provided they come
                            within reasonable total tonnage limitation to be agreed on.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is pleased at evident desire of
                            British Cabinet to endeavor to find some basis of agreement; their
                            desire is reciprocated here, and American Government feels that brief
                            adjournment at Geneva to allow for proper analysis of various schemes
                            and for mature consideration by Governments might serve a useful
                            purpose. I have twice suggested to Mr. Gibson the desirability of a
                            brief recess of that kind. After such recess as suggested, time might be
                            ripe to decide further steps which would be necessary in accordance with
                            Chamberlain’s suggestions. The wide divergence between the British and
                            the Japanese demands is one of the essential factors which the British
                            Government and this Government should keep in mind; I have every reason
                            to believe that Japanese are very anxious to have a low tonnage
                            limitation. Substance of foregoing may be conveyed to Chamberlain.</p>

                        <p>45. I have received following telegram from Houghton dated July 13, 6
                            p.m.: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Your No. 159, July 12, 11 p.m. I hesitate to transmit substance
                                    of your message to Chamberlain for following reasons: (1) As
                                    result of conversation with Chamberlain, British Cabinet has
                                    transmitted through me for you a definite proposal which I think
                                    ought not to be either accepted or declined. I have no way of
                                    knowing whether proposal possesses any merit, but on its face at
                                    least it constitutes offer to modify original instructions to
                                    the British delegation; (2) if I now tell Chamberlain that you
                                    think brief recess advisable he will probably act on suggestion,
                                    although you also say you have twice already made same
                                    suggestion to Gibson who has not, apparently, felt <pb n="103"
                                        xml:id="pg_103" facs="0189"/>it wise; (3) it is my belief
                                    that if adjournment takes place and Bridgeman is called home for
                                    consultation, Admiralty will again obtain command of situation
                                    and we shall lose whatever gains we have made by intervention in
                                    London. It is wholly within range of possibility that the
                                    British will then take the position that as result of our
                                    position any further Conference at this time is useless.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Only definite proposition suggested by Chamberlain is to agree on maximum
                            tonnages each class of ships until 1936. No proposition regarding
                            tonnages of each class was made, so I am unable to understand what is
                            meant by “definite proposals”.</p>
                        <p>I have no desire whatever to take from the delegation the authority to
                            decide whether or not it is advisable to take short adjournment at this
                            time. One would certainly be preferable to having Conference break up in
                            deadlock. I have already apprised Sir Esme Howard of substance of my
                            telegram to Mr. Houghton. Howard asked me if he might say to Chamberlain
                            that I had suggested adjournment to you. I said he could, but that
                            decision would wholly rest with delegation. Please telegraph Houghton
                            any suggestions you have in mind to make about my message and on
                            possible adjournment.</p>

                        <p>86. Houghton’s telegram No. 162, July 12, noon. See my telegram No. 87 to
                            follow. Chamberlain’s first proposal, as we understand it, is precisely
                            what we have consistently urged, to wit, the fixing for a period
                            concurrent with the life of the Washington treaty of a total tonnage for
                            each class, reserving to each of the signatories the right to construct
                            in accordance with its requirements. Chamberlain may, however, have
                            intended to suggest a limitation as to types of cruisers which would
                            have the result of forcing upon us certain kinds of vessels unsuited to
                            our needs.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the four assertions made by Sir Austen, I desire to make
                            the following observations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>It is perfectly well understood by the British delegation that
                                    because of the requirements for extensive cruising radius and
                                    the greatest protection obtainable in conjunction therewith, the
                                    largest sizes of cruisers are of the most value to us.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>There can be no advantage in discussing the matter of
                                    restricting the number of cruisers of maximum size until the
                                    British shall have <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0190"
                                    />consented to a total figure for the whole cruiser category.
                                    Although the matter has been kept open for subsequent
                                    discussion, we cannot of course in the absence of definite
                                    assurance of an embracing and real limitation, make any
                                    commitment on this matter.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>An adjournment of the Conference or the recall of Bridgeman
                                    would not appear to be advisable in the event of Bridgeman’s
                                    being instructed to arrive at an accord on a sensible tonnage
                                    figure by classes. Whether a common meeting ground can be found
                                    for the Japanese and the British is the real and relatively
                                    simple point at issue. We ourselves occupy an advantageous
                                    middle ground. The delegates appear to be in a better frame of
                                    mind and the moment to urge a decision seems opportune. While we
                                    should naturally not withhold consent to, we do not recommend
                                    compliance [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with a British request
                                    for adjournment, should such be made.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>It is too early to venture an opinion concerning the
                                    advisability of your meeting Chamberlain in Geneva until we know
                                    whether any concessions will be consented to at this time by the
                                    British. Unless unforeseen eventualities occur, we are of the
                                    opinion that your influence can be of greatest value in
                                    Washington where it has to date been extremely
                                    efficacious.</item>

                        <p>87. This morning Bridgeman, Cecil, Ishii, and I consulted together
                            privately. Considering that disguised repetitions are the only proposals
                            that have been brought forward by the British thus far, I was ready to
                            tell Bridgeman that the United States had only one positive condition,
                            i. e., that the cruiser requirements of the British Empire should come
                            within a total tonnage that could be considered as actual naval
                            limitation, but that up to the present every British proposal had in
                            effect asked us to sanction by an international treaty their idea of a
                            naval building program, which was already a burden, and at the same time
                            they had attempted to make the United States use types and
                            characteristics that were not at all suitable to our requirements.</p>
                        <p>To my gratification, both Bridgeman and Cecil were in a most friendly
                            mood and while endeavoring in every possible way to overcome any real
                            reduction in their cruiser figures, gave me the impression <pb n="105"
                                xml:id="pg_105" facs="0191"/>that they were becoming convinced that
                            they must make a real effort to meet the American viewpoint. In
                            consequence, I refrained from following the plan I had in mind.
                            Bridgeman still insisted upon a plenary session for Thursday, but he
                            promised that he would send me before the meeting a copy of his
                            contemplated statement in which he would only attempt to make clear the
                            British position with the hope of reaching an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The following proposal was suggested by Ishii:<note n="64"
                                xml:id="d101fn64">Quoted passage not paraphrased.</note>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“If the three powers retain the existing ships, complete the
                                    ships under construction, and execute all of the authorized
                                    programs, the displacement tonnage of auxiliary surface craft,
                                    in the near future, will be represented by the following
                                    figures: For Great Britain 691,000 tons, for the United States
                                    of America 648,000 tons, for Japan 442,000 tons.</p>

                                    to cut down approximately 30 percent respectively from the above
                                    figures, it may be said that an effective limitation has been
                                    realized.</p>
                                <p>In such an event the strength which will be allotted to the
                                    respective powers will be as follows: For Great Britain about
                                    484,000 tons, for the United States of America about 454,000
                                    tons, for Japan about 310,000 tons.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>With reference to the above I would add that the Japanese, in discussing
                            their proposition, recognized the principle of parity between Great
                            Britain and the United States and the slight difference in the American
                            and British total tonnages would be adjusted on that basis in their
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>It was impossible, Bridgeman stated, to discuss by telegraph any such
                            extreme reductions. He assured us that he would have his experts make a
                            study of the entire question.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the conference, I stated most emphatically that until the
                            Japanese and British reached some common meeting ground, it was useless
                            to discuss secondary matters; that I considered this the prime and
                            essential problem now before us. This seemed to be realized by the
                            British and as a consequence the conversation was mainly between the
                            Japanese and themselves. They finally decided that the Japanese
                            suggestion above quoted should be given further consideration.</p>

                        <p>91. Your No. 42, July 12, noon. Stories of similar nature emanating from
                            British sources have been circulated here in regard to activities of
                            representatives of steel interests and others who are interested in the
                            building of a big navy.<note n="65" xml:id="d102fn65">For subsequent

                                Government Printing Office, 1930).</note> I have several times had
                            questions asked me about this by British press correspondents, but
                            nobody has been able to point out who these representatives of special
                            interests are. We know of no one who answers description. It is my own
                            opinion the assertions made are effort by British to explain attitude of
                            American press. The aggressive spirit evinced by American correspondents
                            here comes not from any outside inspiration but, so they tell me, wholly
                            from their indignation at what they regard as raw efforts of one of the
                            other delegations to use them against interests of their own country.
                            This reaction among our correspondents has been unanimous regardless of
                            politics and to us it seems obvious that this is correct explanation.
                            The British have not handled press well throughout Conference, and seem
                            unable to understand that American journalists are fundamentally
                            self-respecting and patriotic. Repeated to London.</p>

                        <p>163. British Ambassador called on me this morning and read telegram
                            containing same suggestion quoted in your telegram No. 162, July 12,
                            noon. Ambassador is equally at loss to know precisely what Chamberlain
                            means by “class”, and whole confusion seems to arise on that point. I
                            think it would be best, nevertheless, if you would give Chamberlain an
                            answer to his suggestion in which you would make clear how his words are
                            understood here and by our delegation at Conference. This Government’s
                            original proposal was clear and <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0193"
                            />definite and was not subject to misunderstanding, and we should be
                            especially careful that no confusion be permitted to arise from use of
                            same terms in different senses by the American and the British
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>In regard to adjournment of Conference, I did not intend in my telegram
                            to you to overrule our delegation’s decision, but merely to suggest to
                            Gibson and his colleagues that we thought that if they came to an
                            impasse or if the British Government wished to consult with Bridgeman,
                            then an adjournment might serve a useful purpose; certainly if British
                            Government wanted an adjournment, we should not object. At present
                            Gibson thinks progress is being made, so there is no immediate necessity
                            for adjournment.</p>

                        <p>99. As you request comments in your telegram No. 45 of July 13, we have,
                            after giving a great deal of thought to the matter, decided that as a
                            last resort you might accept Chamberlain’s suggestion that you meet him
                            in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>However, we are of the opinion that this suggestion may be a part of the
                            effort now being made by the British to postpone a decision in the hope
                            that the issue may be obscured thereby. The passing of time may be of
                            great assistance to them in achieving this point. Do you not think that
                            you might bring the British to some decision by stating to Chamberlain
                            in a friendly manner your idea that it would be useless for you to meet
                            him in Geneva; that no concessions have thus far been made by the
                            British which would bring them within what the Japanese consider an
                            effective limitation; that we have at Geneva a delegation to consider
                            any reasonable proposal, if the British are prepared to make
                            concessions; that it is useless for you to travel all the way from
                            America merely to note the fact that they have no such proposal to
                            offer. Such a statement might be the means of causing them to reach a
                            quick decision as to whether they will accept responsibility for
                            breaking up the Conference or will consent to real naval limitation.</p>
                        <p>It may also be well to suggest to Chamberlain that it would scarcely be
                            appropriate for you to come to Geneva to endeavor to reach a solution
                            for the British in determining differences which are blocking all
                            progress at the present time.</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0194"/>
                        <p>With reference to the above, Admiral Jones and I have just received a
                            visit from Saito who told us definitely that the Japanese refuse even to
                            discuss a figure exceeding 315,000 tons in the combined destroyer and
                            cruiser classes for Japan. This point, he further said, was today being
                            brought unequivocally to the British delegation’s attention. Thus it
                            will be up to them to decide whether they will reduce their figures to
                            approximately 500,000 tons for the combined cruiser and destroyer
                            classes or accept whatever consequences may result from their
                            refusal.</p>

                        <p>50. Your No. 99, July 15, 3 p.m. I do not have any intention of going to
                            Geneva and telegraphed to Houghton at noon as follows, in accordance
                            with your suggestion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“165. If any possible feeling on Chamberlain’s part that the
                                    Secretary of State may be willing to enter Conference in last
                                    moment attempt to effect settlement should cause him to delay

                                    circumstances which would make advisable my going to Geneva,

                        <p>105. This morning Bridgeman, Cecil, Ishii, and Saito met with me
                            privately. The conversation was begun by Ishii by referring to previous
                            informal talks between Admiral Field of the British delegation and
                            Admiral Kobayashi of the Japanese delegation. He laid stress on the
                            tentative nature of the previous conversations and said that naturally
                            no definite agreement had been concluded but that the Japanese had
                            cabled Tokyo a complete résumé of what had taken <pb n="110"
                                xml:id="pg_110" facs="0196"/>place. Viscount Ishii then gave me a
                            memorandum which contained all the items of their conversation. After
                            looking over the Japanese memorandum, Mr. Bridgeman said that it was an
                            exact résumé of the discussions as he had understood them. Substance of
                            the memorandum follows: <list>

                                            would need approximately 70,000 tons of
                                            submarines.</item>

                        <p>This, you will observe, is almost identical with the report in my
                            telegram No. 101 of July 17.<note n="69" xml:id="d108fn69">Not
                                printed.</note> Ishii, in explaining the memorandum, laid emphasis
                            on the fact that the Japanese had reached the figure of 325,000 tons by
                            adding 10,000 to the former total beyond which they had declared
                            themselves resolved not to go, and by eliminating, on Admiral Field’s
                            suggestion, 10,000 tons of submarines. This change, he believed, would
                            be welcome to the Japanese Finance Ministry since the cost per ton of
                            submarines was far greater than for surface vessels.</p>
                        <p>I inquired, with reference to point 2, what the age limit of vessels was
                            to be. The American suggestion of 16 years for destroyers and 20 years
                            for cruisers was acceptable to Japan, Ishii replied. Bridgeman appeared
                            uncertain as to this point but Cecil stated that it was his idea that
                            the original Japanese proposal of 12 years for destroyers and 16 years
                            for cruisers had been adopted. (While the matter seems <pb n="111"
                                xml:id="pg_111" facs="0197"/>to have been left unsettled it is
                            evident that the British would prefer the Japanese suggestions as to age
                            limits to their own in view of their desire to retain a certain number
                            of ships having reached the age limit.)</p>
                        <p>The ships named in point 4, it is pointed out, would come within the
                            total limit of 500,000 tons. They were specially mentioned in order to
                            indicate that they would be kept despite their being above the 6,000–ton
                            figure desired by the British as the largest size below 10,000 tons.
                            They would, of course, not be numbered among vessels dealt with in point
                            3, displacing 10,000 tons.</p>
                        <p>I was assured that there was no intention to depart from the idea of a
                            treaty which should end in 1936. The Japanese delegation were asked by
                            Cecil whether they attached great importance to parity in submarines
                            mentioned in point 7 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>). Ishii unhesitatingly
                            replied that Japan needed at least 60,000 tons but would raise no
                            difficulty if the United States and Great Britain desired for themselves
                            a larger figure. (Ishii’s calm and lucid declaration leads me to infer
                            that, despite the fact that Admiral Field had suggested it, Japan did
                            not intend to stand out for equality in submarines.)</p>
                        <p>Concerning point 5, the American delegation stated that they would have
                            opinions to give upon this, as the Japanese situation was different from
                            that of the American in that on the basis of the proposals made the
                            Americans would have available tonnage for 8-inch-gun cruisers whereas
                            the Japanese would have no such tonnage. However, until we had had an
                            opportunity to study the entire memorandum, I thought it wisest to
                            postpone discussion of the question.</p>

                        <p>53. Your No. 100, July 16, 2 p.m. Appreciate fully the circumstances
                            which necessitated preparation of your statement so as to <pb n="112"
                                xml:id="pg_112" facs="0198"/>conform to situation at last moment;
                            there was, I know, insufficient time for you to submit it to me. I think
                            it was a dignified, comprehensive, and moderate speech, and American
                            press agrees with me in this opinion. My general criticism of it would
                            be that there was tendency throughout to use general instead of specific
                            terms in those places where exact meaning of a reference could not fail
                            to be clear to hearers around the table but which might conceivably be
                            obscure to world at large for whose benefit it was that British had
                            urged the plenary session. That is to say, I see no reason why
                            particular facts which display British attitude should not be set forth;
                            for example, reference to fact that speedy, armed merchantmen are
                            equivalents of cruisers with 6-inch guns and that United States has
                            comparatively small number of such merchant vessels. I should also have
                            laid stress on fact of British acceptance of cruiser and destroyer
                            tonnage which was agreed to at Washington Conference on Limitation of
                            Armament, at which no claim was made for greater tonnage, and that world
                            conditions since that Conference have certainly not been more
                            threatening than they were then and do not justify the enormous tonnage
                            increases demanded. At point where you suggested that United States did
                            not commence the building of 10,000-ton cruisers, I should have made
                            specific statement that Great Britain had four 9,750-ton cruisers built
                            between 1918 and 1925, of which two were built after Washington
                            Conference; that since then twelve have been built, that two are now
                            building and one laid down. These figures are taken from Chamberlain’s
                            statement to me. I should inquire what country would raid British
                            commerce; against whom could British Government require increases in
                            cruiser tonnage? Especial emphasis should be laid on question of economy
                            which British have been constantly bringing forward; it is important to
                            show as you did that there is no economy in reducing unit sizes of
                            battleships where the total tonnage remains the same, and the same
                            observation applies to cruisers.</p>
                        <p>Should another plenary session become necessary I believe that a
                            downright statement of facts to justify our conclusions is especially
                            desirable; it is our desire, of course, to be courteous, but the facts
                            should be stated no matter whom they hit.</p>
                        <p>Against the event that question of commerce raiders be again brought up
                            in public session it is possible that it might be well to have prepared
                            a list of the entire cruiser strength of all countries outside the three
                            powers present at the Conference in order to see from what quarter Great
                            Britain might have cause to fear that disturbances might come.</p>
                        <p>If Conference breaks up, then you should make a clear, specific statement
                            of our position, stressing the points on which disagreement <pb n="113"
                                xml:id="pg_113" facs="0199"/>exists, pointing out particularly the
                            enormous increase that Great Britain may demand; the increase in
                            original cost and maintenance; and that instead of decreasing or
                            limiting burdens of taxation Great Britain’s position would increase
                            them. Statement should be as brief as can be, and should cover salient
                            points; time should be taken for its preparation. It is difficult, I
                            know, to frame such statement now, as first you have to know exactly
                            points on which Conference might fail to arrive at agreement.</p>

                        <p>106. A decision on certain specific matters will clearly be necessary if
                            the memorandum cited in my telegram No. 105 of July 18 is to be outlined
                            as a groundwork for further debate respecting surface vessels. These
                            matters which we ask you to consider and upon which we would like to
                            have instructions from you are: (1) The proportion allotted to Japan
                            with relation to our own; (2) the question of guns of 8-inch caliber;
                            (3) maximum unit tonnage of the suggested smaller cruiser type.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the first point, a proportion of 5–3.25 would result from
                            the suggested figure of 500,000 tons of surface craft for the United
                            States and Great Britain and 325,000 tons for the Japanese Empire. This
                            ratio in the opinion of the naval advisers concedes too much and might
                            gravely endanger the American western Pacific position. They believe
                            that no departure from the 5–3 ratio should be permitted and draw your
                            attention to the Navy General Board papers on the subject. A small
                            advance over the 5–3 ratio might possibly be made if one or several
                            smaller vessels were named or concession in destroyers were made but
                            this is only proposed because the Japanese would be offended by our
                            intransigence on the subject of ratio, which might frustrate further
                            efforts to arrive at an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The proposed smaller category of cruiser and the nature of its armament
                            is the really crucial point involved in the question of the 8-inch gun.
                            Throughout the negotiations the British have been insistent that this
                            category should be limited to guns of 6 inches, while our Naval advisers
                            all agree that we must strictly maintain the right of placing 8-inch
                            guns on the smaller class. This entails <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114"
                                facs="0200"/>the necessity of a maximum unit tonnage of at least
                            8,300 tons. Since the Japanese would have no extra tonnage within which
                            to build this type of cruiser until 1936 we can scarcely expect them to
                            support our position to any great extent, although we believe them to be
                            in agreement with us in principle and think that they would have no
                            objection to the maximum displacement above-mentioned with respect to
                            the smaller type of cruiser. We desire to be instructed regarding the
                            maximum size of the lesser type of cruiser and as to the question of the
                            8-inch gun. There can be no advantage in discussing any remaining
                            questions until a decision is reached on these two matters. It is,
                            moreover, on these very questions that the British might try to break up
                            the Conference should we be firm in standing on our position. While we
                            interpret our instructions as directing us strictly to maintain, in
                            respect to all future cruisers, our class of armament, your definite
                            corroboration of this is desired.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the retention of obsolete vessels, the British
                            suggestion is clearly a camouflaged means of bringing total limitation
                            to 625,000 tons, which is, however, within a figure which can be
                            discussed by us. Certain factors such as quantity are susceptible of
                            being changed, in order to render the plan more agreeable to us until
                            1936, but until the points mentioned in the preceding paragraph are
                            settled it is idle to go into these features of the situation and this
                            also applies to the question of the number of 10,000-ton vessels which
                            each country might have.</p>
                        <p>It is seriously within the bounds of possibility that the Conference
                            might be wrecked on any one of these matters, and we accordingly seek
                            your instructions thereupon. While, of course, we are ready firmly to
                            hold our ground, we are of the opinion that the entire subject should be
                            studied by you both in its technical and its political aspects before we
                            take up our final position.</p>

                                <item>The Americans were to withdraw demand for liberty of armament,
                                    which we do not believe you have any intention of doing. It is
                                    our opinion that the British delegation in Geneva is so
                                    influenced by Admiralty tenets that it is unable duly to
                                    consider the broader suggestions which are not sponsored by some
                                    ulterior motive. Therefore, it is thought you may care to
                                    consider discussing this problem with the British Ambassador in
                                    a very informal and personal way, pointing out to Sir Esme the
                                    insistence of the British in thrusting upon the United States a
                                    class of cruiser for which our country has practically no use in
                                    their endeavor to abolish the 8-inch gun and the resentment that
                                    will be engendered in the United States by such a maneuver; that
                                    due to previous construction it is plainly to be seen that the
                                    British will continue to have a superior strength in cruisers
                                    during the existence of the treaty under discussion; that should
                                    the United States consent to withdraw her demands concerning the
                                    8-inch gun the British superiority would be definitely increased
                                    by reason of the fact that Great Britain has 49 merchant ships
                                    and our inferiority would be most evidently accentuated by a
                                    strict limitation as to ships concerned. Should the British
                                    Government recognize freely our right to decide the type of
                                    armament required by us, which in any case would be exercised
                                    only in regard to a small part of the tonnage allocated to us,
                                    the British Ambassador could judge for himself whether, under
                                    ordinary circumstances and without irritation of an artificial
                                    nature, the United States would be likely to build a sufficient
                                    number of 8-inch-gun cruisers to give Great Britain any serious
                                    concern. The disruption of the Conference over this issue, on
                                    the other hand, could not fail to give rise to a popular demand
                                    for the building of cruisers armed with 8-inch guns to such an
                                    extent as to be disagreeable to us and to constitute the
                                    contrary of what the British seek to bring about. We naturally
                                    could give no undertaking regarding the future actions of
                                    Congress in case of agreement, but the British Ambassador should
                                    realize that the most sensible manner of dealing with us in the
                                    premises is to avoid raising any question as to our freedom in
                                    matters of armament which would result only in marked resentment
                                    accentuated by the knowledge that, since the Japanese share our
                                    views, the British are alone in seeking to limit us to 6-inch
                                    guns.</item>

                            Secretary of the Navy and with the naval experts, our opinion is

                                <item>After reaching agreement on total cruiser tonnage, we must
                                    retain right to construct number and type of cruisers up to
                                    10,000 tons together with liberty to arm such cruisers up to
                                    8-inch guns, within total tonnage agreed upon, or as with new
                                    construction our needs may require;</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>We do not understand Japanese delegation’s suggestion set
                                    forth in your No. 105, July 18, 3 p.m. Please cable explanations
                                    and additional figures. We fail to see how the 25 percent of the
                                    total tonnage of old vessels would make it possible for us to
                                    use destroyer <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0203"/>tonnage
                                    until we should have built up in cruiser tonnage. We should have
                                    to scrap these, apparently, and would be unable to build any
                                    more. We do not understand, moreover, why the British
                                    proposition has it that we build only twelve 10,000-ton cruisers
                                    when the British themselves have larger number if their
                                    9,750-ton cruisers are included.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>We do not believe that the British actually intend to limit
                                    tonnage of cruisers to extent which will be satisfactory, but
                                    have in mind to break up Conference on matter of size of guns
                                    and cruisers. It is our belief that British should first agree
                                    on total cruiser tonnage not to exceed our 400,000 tons.</item>

                        <p>108. Meeting this morning with Bridgeman, Cecil, Ishii and Saito to
                            continue discussion memorandum quoted in my 105, July 18, 3 p.m. I
                            pointed out that in my opinion the suggestion of 500,000 tons surface
                            craft and the retention in addition thereto of 25 percent over-age
                            vessels was in effect a camouflage method of increasing total tonnage to
                            625,000 tons; that while latter figure was within range of figures we
                            had reluctantly indicated a willingness to discuss I felt that it might
                            be more candid to give the total tonnage including so-called over-age
                            ships, particularly if the age limit fixed was to be 16 years for
                            cruisers and 12 for destroyers. I said that it might be different if the
                            age limits were 20 and 16 years. Bridgeman said that their suggestion
                            had been on the bases of 16 and 12 years respectively but that these
                            ages might be open to negotiation. Ishii stated that Japanese delegation
                            had felt that for ships constructed prior to Washington Conference and
                            which had gone through the war the figure of 16 and 12 years might be
                            equitable but that for post-Washington ships they would desire age
                            limits to 20 and 16 years respectively. Ishii also indicated that the
                            idea of a separate class of over-age vessels would be convenient for
                            them, [that they?] could accept a reasonable ratio to 500,000 tons for
                            the United States and Great Britain but could not agree to a ratio to
                            625,000 tons. (Apparently the camouflage facilitates Japanese position
                            as it would not require new construction on their part to reach
                            approximately 300,000 tons of surface craft other than the 10,000-ton
                            cruisers contemplated.)</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0204"/>
                        <p>I pointed out that except for destroyers and certain decrepit armored
                            cruisers we would have nothing that would go into the over-age class but
                            that if we could reach agreement on other questions I would be prepared
                            to discuss a formula for retention of over-age ships but could not
                            commit myself to it at the present juncture.</p>
                        <p>I then stated that I wished to get down to the real question upon which
                            our whole discussion hinged, namely, the 8-inch gun; that if this
                            question was discussed solely from the technical point of view it was
                            doubtful if a solution could be realized; that the only possible way to
                            reach a solution was through discussing the problem from the point of
                            view of its practical application to the relations of the two countries;
                            that it was nothing more than the question of how we were likely to use
                            a part of our cruiser tonnage and that I wished to present to them the
                            broad political aspects of this question rather than its
                            technicalities.</p>
                        <p>I made it clear that on the basis of 300,000 tons of cruisers and
                            assuming twelve or more 10,000-ton cruisers were constructed and with
                            retention of <hi rend="italic">Omahas</hi> we would have available only
                            100,000 tons or less for other cruiser construction and that as a
                            practical matter during the life of the treaty it was in my personal
                            opinion problematical whether we would avail ourselves of all of this
                            tonnage in 8-inch-gun cruisers in addition to the construction of a
                            given number of 10,000-ton cruisers.</p>
                        <p>In view of Japanese situation which on the basis under discussion would
                            permit no new construction of vessels other than specified 10,000-ton
                            vessels the issue was clearly one between the United States and Great
                            Britain and I asked the British delegates to clearly consider our
                            probable course of action in the way of construction of 8-inch [-gun]
                            vessels; first, if we reached friendly agreement and had a treaty; and
                            second, if our negotiations broke down because of British attempt to
                            impose on us a type of vessel which is unsuitable for us.</p>
                        <p>I said that in my opinion if an attempt were made to deny our liberty of
                            armament within tonnage limitation there was danger they would find they
                            had driven us into an extensive building program.</p>
                        <p>I made it quite clear that in my opinion treaty which deprived us of our
                            liberty of action with respect to arming the proposed second class of
                            cruisers as we saw fit would not be ratified; that Great Britain had
                            assured cruiser supremacy for many years to come, an overwhelming
                            merchant fleet which could be armed; that we could not be expected to
                            accept restrictions as to arming cruisers and that an attempt to deny us
                            our liberty of action would be the best method of arousing popular
                            resentment and driving us into a big building program.</p>
                        <p>Cecil seemed to be considerably impressed by this statement, Bridgeman
                            less so. Latter stated that our insistence upon right to build <pb
                                n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0205"/>8-inch [-gun] cruisers would
                            force them to readjust their tonnage levels upward; that they had
                            already made considerable concessions to get down to tonnage levels
                            which we could all discuss and that this had been conditioned upon
                            elimination of 8-inch gun except on specified number of 10,000-ton
                            cruisers.</p>
                        <p>I asked Bridgeman to look at this whole problem along the lines I had
                            indicated; that the crux of the whole problem was whether they thought
                            we were likely to dispose of 100,000 tons or less of cruisers tonnage in
                            such a way as to threaten the security of the British Empire. If so, we
                            ought to know it. If not, there should be no strong reason for
                            contesting our right to build as we like.</p>
                        <p>I then reemphasized that in my opinion British insistence was based on
                            fear of a situation which was not likely to arise, namely, a building
                            program of 8-inch-gun vessels which would be source of apprehension to
                            the British Empire, and I again suggested the possibility of some
                            political clause in the treaty which would permit reexamination of the
                            cruiser provision in the event that our construction of 8-inch-gun
                            vessels was a cause of apprehension to either of the other contracting
                            powers. Cecil took up this suggestion and we had a brief discussion as
                            to the form which such an article might take and then adjourned until
                            tomorrow when we will give the matter further consideration.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] A stipulation of this nature may conceivably afford an
                            escape from the present difficulty and I shall today or tomorrow cable
                            you a proposed solution in accordance with this idea. Additional
                            instructions from his Government are awaited by Bridgeman and he is not
                            urging an early decision on the matter of 8-inch guns. Sending copy to

                        <p>110. I was informed this evening by Bridgeman that Cecil and he had
                            received instructions to proceed to London for consultations which would
                            consume about a week’s time, but that he trusted he would be able to
                            return to Geneva by Monday to resume his duties. It seems to me that
                            while Bridgeman and Cecil are discussing matters with the Cabinet in
                            London it would be a most opportune time for a plain presentation of the
                            American attitude as regards essentials to be placed before the British.
                            My reason for suggesting this <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0206"
                            />is that from the commencement of the Conference both the Japanese and
                            American delegations have felt that Bridgeman was loath to believe that
                            the statements made by our two delegations were the real opinions of the
                            American and Japanese Governments, and that we would eventually accede
                            to the British proposals if some method could be found to disguise the
                            main issues. We therefore undertake to suggest that you present to the
                            British Ambassador or to Mr. Chilton a full statement of our views in
                            the premises, or, if you do not consider this advisable, that you have
                            Mr. Houghton transmit a résumé of our position to Chamberlain in London
                            so that during their conferences with Bridgeman the Cabinet may have our
                            opinions before them. It is further suggested that a plain statement be
                            made that we consider the following points absolutely essential and that
                            we have no intention of foregoing these, and that we do not consider it
                            at all necessary to continue discussing other matters if the British are
                            unwilling to have a discussion on this basis.</p>

                                would be necessary to fix a tonnage level which would represent real
                                limitation, i. e., very slightly greater than tonnage now in use by
                                the British plus the surface combatant vessels they now have under
                                construction.</item>

                        <p>Definite announcement by the British regarding their stand on the above

                            we entertain the hope that Mr. Bridgeman will, upon his return from
                            London, be able to give us definite replies.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with him this evening I said that I hoped the British
                            would find it possible to meet us on some common ground and that he
                            would not return with their old proposals under different guise.</p>

                        <p>111. Your No. 55, July 19, 4 p.m., points 2–3, states that we were to
                            reserve the liberty, after agreement on total tonnage for cruisers, to
                            construct within the agreed tonnage any type and number of vessels up to
                            10,000 tons with the right of placing thereon 8-inch guns or such
                            armament as our requirements might call for.</p>
                        <p>This would constitute, and we feel it our duty to draw your attention to
                            the fact, a more unbending attitude than was envisaged in the course of
                            the conversations we had in Washington when it was determined that our
                            rights should be upheld to the allocation in maximum size cruisers of 60
                            to 70 percent of our total cruiser tonnage. The statement under
                            reference, further, runs counter to Admiral Jones’ declarations in the
                            technical committee and to my own statements in the plenary session and
                            to those of the other chief delegates, to the effect that we would be
                            willing to examine the subject of the percentage of largest size
                            cruisers if desired. We feel quite certain, should we at the present
                            time flatly declare our right to allocate our entire tonnage to
                            10,000-ton vessels, that the British would claim that we had gone back
                            on our previous promises in the matter and would be quick to use this as
                            an excuse for wrecking the Conference. In the event of a rupture, we
                            should be most careful not to furnish them with a pretext. My telegram
                            No. 106, July 18, contained a suggestion concerning the smaller class of
                            cruiser which had been elaborated by the naval advisers of our
                            delegation. They are now in receipt of the Navy Department’s studies,
                            transmitted in your telegram No. 56, of July 19,<note n="74"
                                xml:id="d117fn74">Not printed.</note> which show that our needs can
                            be efficiently met by <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0208"/>an
                            8,300-ton cruiser, and we therefore believe that it would be far more
                            advisable not to depart from the attitude hitherto adopted of being
                            willing to examine the possibility of a smaller category of cruiser,
                            upon which 8-inch guns could be effectively mounted. Should the British
                            then decline to entertain conversations on this basis our position would
                            be a strong one.</p>
                        <p>A declaration of our insistence upon our power of allocating all the
                            tonnage which we have available to 10,000-ton cruisers would be most
                            unfortunate. Upon this point the entire delegation is agreed. We are
                            equally agreed as to the essential necessity of avoiding any sacrifice
                            whatever of primordial interests but we also wish to avoid the
                            possibility of being blamed for declining to examine the suggestions
                            which are reasonable.</p>

                            thought of during discussions in Washington in regard to the use of
                            about 70 percent of total tonnage in the construction of 10,000-ton
                            cruisers. Remaining cruiser tonnage would include 10 cruisers of the <hi

                            cruisers of an agreed tonnage. Department does not desire you, of
                            course, to refuse to discuss any plan or proposal which you have agreed
                            to discuss. Department feels, however, that recommendation made by naval
                            advisers (see your No. 106, July 18, 11 p.m.) on right to arm all new
                            cruisers with 8-inch guns should be adhered to.</p>

                        <p>60. Sir Esme Howard called on me today, primarily, so he said, to let me
                            know that Mr. Chilton was returning to Washington, but that <pb n="123"
                                xml:id="pg_123" facs="0209"/>Sir Esme himself was going back to
                            Manchester, Massachusetts, but would come down any time I wished. He
                            then remarked, incidentally, that he had observed in the press that the
                            British and Japanese delegations had reached agreement on equality of
                            submarine tonnage, and that he wished to deny truth of report. I said
                            that I did not understand that the two delegations had come to such an
                            agreement, although the British had proposed one which the Japanese had
                            stated they did not desire. I thought it well that I should let him know
                            I was aware of the British proposition. The Ambassador then discussed
                            the Conference very generally, saying he was not very hopeful in regard
                            to it and that he felt Great Britain had made great concessions but that
                            the American delegation had not made any. I stated very emphatically
                            that our delegation had made extensive concessions by suggesting we
                            might agree to tonnage level much higher than we had originally
                            proposed; that it was true that if the British demanded over 400,000
                            tons there would be no object to making a treaty, and that we did not
                            believe that the Japanese would accept this. As far as concerns Great
                            Britain’s position in trying to force this Government to build the
                            greater portion of its cruisers in small tonnage with 6-inch guns, the
                            British Government might as well understand that the Government of the
                            United States could not and would not accept it. I explained to him
                            again the necessity for larger unit cruiser displacement and for
                            8-inch-gun armament, particularly in view of larger number of
                            merchantmen which Great Britain has which she can arm with 6-inch guns.
                            Howard said that British Navy denied this. I replied that I depended on
                            our Navy for our opinion. I also took advantage of this occasion
                            practically to comply with your No. 110, July 19, midnight, and to
                            inform Howard that Great Britain must not only agree to a total tonnage,
                            if any treaty was to be made, but must also agree to the mounting of
                            8-inch guns. I do not doubt that he will report immediately to his
                            Government what I said.</p>

                        <p>102. A member of my staff who had an informal talk with the Vice Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs today took the occasion to refer to the reported
                            agreement on July 16th at Geneva by the Japanese delegation with the
                            last British proposal. The Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that
                            Admiral Kobayashi had expressed the opinion to Admiral Field that the
                            Japanese Government would accept these proposals. <pb n="124"
                                xml:id="pg_124" facs="0210"/>Mr. Debuchi said that the Japanese
                            Government had not however given its assent and that the proposals were
                            still subject to tripartite discussion. He intimated that the Japanese
                            Government still hoped to bring the maximum combined cruiser-destroyer
                            tonnage down to 450,000 tons and stated that the British 6-inch gun
                            proposal had not received the approval of the naval experts here. He
                            said that the Japanese Government also realized that the obsolete
                            cruiser tonnage clause presented difficulties. As regards submarine
                            tonnage, he said that the Japanese had hoped for 70,000 tons. The Vice
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated, however, that no decision had
                            been reached by the Japanese Government and that they especially wished
                            our Government to understand, as he having [<hi rend="italic">had</hi>]
                            made and felt sure Saito had made plain, that they have no intention of
                            placing us in a difficult position by reaching a preliminary accord with
                            the British. He said that this was a three-power Conference and would
                            remain so.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have not written you
                            of late about the Geneva Conference, as I thought the paraphrase of
                            telegrams we are forwarding would keep you fairly well posted, that is,
                            if you have time to go through them. I know it is quite a job and the
                            discussion is often more or less technical. Everything that comes from
                            Geneva is taken up with the Navy Department and I am keeping in close
                            touch with the Secretary and with Admiral Eberle and his Assistants. I
                            cannot say that I am very hopeful of any practical result from the
                            Conference. As you will notice, there seems to be very little trouble
                            about an agreement so far as submarines and destroyers are concerned,
                            although no definite understanding has yet been reached by the
                            Conference, but there are very grave difficulties over the question of
                            cruisers. The principal points raised are, first, the total tonnage of
                            cruisers, and second, the size of cruisers and the gun caliber of their
                            armament. As to the first proposition, as you know much to the surprise
                            of everybody, Great Britain’s demands as to the tonnage of cruisers were
                            exorbitant. Japan would not think of agreeing to anything of the kind
                            and so far as the United States is concerned it would be perfectly
                            unless, in fact, injurious to make such an agreement. Admirals Jones and
                            Long and Mr. Gibson, who had been in touch with the British during the
                            Preliminary Conference and with the British Admiralty in London, were
                            very greatly suprised and disappointed. We had, in fact, no reason at
                            all to think Great Britain would demand any such thing.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>You will notice that they started in with a suggestion of about 600,000
                            tons. One of their experts even suggested 750,000 tons. They then came
                            down to 562,000 tons and finally stated they would be willing to accept
                            462,000 tons up to 1936, but should build to 562,000 tons after that. Of
                            course neither Japan nor the United States was willing to agree to any
                            such proposition and after a long time I think the British Government
                            came to the conclusion that it was useless to negotiate on that basis.
                            Finally the British, after discussing it with the Japanese, suggested
                            that they might agree to 500,000 tons of cruisers and destroyers, under
                            sixteen years of age for cruisers and twelve years of age for
                            destroyers, provided they were permitted to keep twenty-five percent of
                            their total tonnage (500,000 tons) in addition to this in vessels over
                            these ages. Why this was put in this form I cannot understand and
                            neither do the Navy, and I am awaiting detailed explanation from Geneva.
                            We could agree to 500,000 tons which could be divided, say 200,000 tons
                            for destroyers and 300,000 tons for cruisers, and, in fact, I suppose we
                            might make an agreement for 625,000 tons divided between the two. But it
                            all depends on what we can build in the place of our old cruisers, all
                            of which are over twenty years of age except 75,000 tons, and whether we
                            would have to scrap a large number of modern destroyers. On this subject
                            we have not yet received any information.</p>
                        <p>Second, the question of the size of cruisers and armament is a more
                            difficult problem. Great Britain insists that the three powers agree on
                            the number of 10,000 ton cruisers which the countries shall reserve the
                            right to build during the life of the treaty and the number of smaller
                            cruisers and the size of guns. Great Britain would like to have 6,000
                            ton cruisers or 7,500 ton cruisers, armed with six inch guns. Our
                            experts in Geneva and the Navy here insist on the right to build 10,000
                            ton cruisers armed with eight inch guns, their reasons being that we
                            need cruisers of wider cruising range than a 6,000 or 7,000 ton cruiser
                            can have, and that Great Britain has a large number of merchant ships,
                            over fifty I believe, which are fast and can be armed with six inch
                            guns, while we have but few. Great Britain has many naval posts all over
                            the world, which enables her to use smaller cruisers with shorter
                            cruising range.</p>
                        <p>In answer to this the British say that if we build all our cruisers
                            hereafter 10,000 tons, they will be compelled to build a large number.
                            Great Britain already has something like seventeen cruisers between
                            9,750 tons and 10,000 tons, mostly the latter. Geneva has asked
                            instructions as to whether we insist on the right to build all our
                            tonnage in 10,000 ton cruisers armed with eight inch guns. After a long
                            session yesterday, the Navy concluded that as we already had ten 7,500
                            ton cruisers that we could agree that during the life <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0212"/>of this treaty we would not build over
                            about seventy percent of our total tonnage in 10,000 ton cruisers. I
                            take it from all that was said yesterday that we probably could not do
                            it anyhow, and this would be a perfectly safe agreement, at least the
                            delegation at Geneva and the Navy authorities here agree so, but they
                            insist that if they build cruisers less than 10,000 tons they shall have
                            the right to arm them with eight inch guns. Of course this is a
                            technical question on which I am not qualified to speak and I am
                            governed by the opinion of the Navy officials. However the fact that we
                            have 75,000 tons of these modern cruisers makes it safe for us to agree
                            on the percentage I have suggested. I think the Navy would be willing,
                            if we desired to build more than seventy percent of our total tonnage,
                            to build 7,500 or 8,000 ton cruisers if they could arm them with eight
                            inch guns. Personally, I am under the impression that if we desire more
                            cruisers we could use some smaller cruisers at home bases, I mean by
                            that in the neighborhood of the United States and Hawaii, just as well
                            as the British Government would do, but I do not feel competent to
                            decide this question myself.</p>
                        <p>We sent a telegram yesterday authorizing them to agree that we would not
                            build over about seventy percent of our cruisers in 10,000 ton size
                            before the expiration of this treaty in 1936, but insisted on arming all
                            our cruisers except those we already had with eight inch guns. Of
                            course, there is absolutely nothing in Great Britain’s claim that the
                            building of small cruisers is an economy, because taking a certain
                            tonnage, say 300,000 tons of cruisers, of course it is more expensive to
                            build small cruisers than large cruisers and it is just the same with
                            battleships if you wish to maintain the same total tonnage. This economy
                            program which Great Britain is putting forward is without the slightest
                            merit and is put forward in my judgment to camouflage a demand for an
                            enormous tonnage of cruisers.</p>
                        <p>The British delegation have been called home to consult the Cabinet. What
                            the result will be I cannot say, but I doubt very much whether Great
                            Britain will be willing to make any agreement which our Navy officials
                            would be willing to make and which we could get ratified by the Senate.
                            I told the British Ambassador yesterday that the American delegation had
                            made great concessions in raising the total tonnage of cruisers, that we
                            did not believe that the Japanese would even come up to this basis, that
                            if the British Government was trying to force the United States to build
                            a major portion of its cruisers in small tonnage armed with six inch
                            guns they might as well understand that we would not do it, that Britain
                            must not only make a limitation in total tonnage to which we could
                            agree, with the right to arm with eight inch guns, or no treaty could be
                            made. I am doing, of course, <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0213"
                            />everything I can to make the Conference a success, practically
                            spending all my time at it, but I am somewhat disturbed by the situation
                            over there and by the insistence of the British Government on its
                            demands. I cannot understand against whom Great Britain feels it
                            necessary to have such sized armament. There are no other navies in the
                            world which could possibly endanger her commerce or her colonies, or
                            could possibly threaten her present navy and we have offered to put a
                            clause in the treaty which would release all parties if any country laid
                            down a building program which would threaten the building program of any
                            of the signatory powers.</p>
                        <p>It is hard to keep you posted from day to day as things change so rapidly
                            and the flood of telegrams is so great I do not feel justified in
                            sending all of them to you by telegram.</p>

                            a Japanese suggestion. It represents points discussed by British and

                            to reconcile differences between British and Japanese regarding total
                            tonnage.</p>
                        <p>Following is in explanation of heading 2 respecting retention of an
                            additional 25 percent over and above 500,000 tons of surface craft for
                            the United States and Great Britain and approximately 300,000 tons for
                            Japan. In executive committee meeting July 9th Viscount Ishii said that
                            the Japanese delegation were prepared to consider favorably a suggestion
                            made by Mr. Bridgeman that if a number of ships were allowed to be
                            retained after they had reached their replacement age this would
                            facilitate discussing the questions of total tonnage and total number of
                            smaller cruisers. This idea of retaining over-age vessels has previously
                            been incorporated in various proposals presented by the British (see my
                            83, July 12, 9 p.m.; 101, July 17 noon;<note n="76" xml:id="d122fn76"
                                >Telegram No. 101 not printed.</note> also see comment thereon in my
                            105 and 106). The essence of the proposal is: <pb n="128"
                                xml:id="pg_128" facs="0214"/>
                            <list>
                                <item>First, neither the United States nor Great Britain shall
                                    maintain more than 500,000 tons of auxiliary surface craft
                                    including cruisers and destroyers which are under the age limits
                                    of 16 and 12 years;</item>
                                <item>Second, the two powers may each maintain an additional 125,000
                                    tons of ships which have passed the ages of 16 and 12
                                    years;</item>
                                <item>Third, as ships pass from the first to the second group they
                                    may be replaced in the former by completed new construction; but
                                    in the event that the tonnage of the second group had already
                                    been entirely taken up by over-age vessels an equivalent tonnage
                                    from the second group would have to be scrapped;</item>
                                <item>Fourth, the total tonnage of the first group could be filled
                                    up to its limit by new construction and thereafter new
                                    construction could only proceed as vessels of the first group
                                    passed the age limit.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Insofar as our present situation is concerned such a proposal would not
                            require immediate scrapping. In the allowed 500,000 tons of surface
                            craft we could retain 10 <hi rend="italic">Omahas</hi>, 60,000 tons,
                            also approximately 50,000 tons of old cruisers and all our 307,000 tons
                            of destroyers. In the over-age tonnage of 125,000 we could place our
                            remaining 115,000 tons of very old cruisers or we could maintain such
                            other subdivision of cruisers and destroyers as appeared desirable. As
                            new cruisers are completed we could fill up the first group to the
                            allowed 500,000 tons and thereafter transfer over-age vessels to the
                            second group as required and scrap the oldest vessels when the
                            125,000-ton limitation is reached. (All figures in Washington standard
                            tons.)</p>
                        <p>This proposal as advanced is of advantage to Great Britain in that the
                            total tonnage figure is camouflaged and permits her to build up to a
                            total of 500,000 tons of cruisers and destroyers below their proposed
                            age limits of 16 years for cruisers and 12 years for destroyers. Great
                            Britain is in a position to fill the supplementary group of 125,000 tons
                            during the life of the treaty with efficient vessels which are now less
                            than 16 years old (which we could not do) and gives them a clear
                            advantage over the United States of all vessels placed in the second
                            group. Before we could discuss such a plan we should have to devise
                            modifications which would give us adequate compensation in second
                            group.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese do not desire a total tonnage limitation which will lead to
                            new construction on their part, as they have stated that their people
                            would force them into building if the treaty permitted it. On the basis
                            of approximately 300,000 tons of surface craft in first place they would
                            not have any free tonnage available for construction other than that
                            tonnage required for the completion of the 10,000-ton cruisers now
                            building or projected by them. Further they would not have any
                            considerable number of vessels which would <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129"
                                facs="0215"/>pass into the second group thus making room for new
                            construction. The vessels which the Japanese would be able to place in
                            the second group are generally of low combatant value and it is judged
                            from their previous propositions that they feel they would be as
                            satisfactorily situated without these vessels as with them. The Japanese
                            have apparently acquiesced in this proposal in an endeavor to facilitate
                            solution of the British problem. The only features of this plan which
                            might make it deserving of consideration with a view to modification to
                            meet our situation are that it tends to restrict new construction on the
                            part of the nations and brings the tonnage of cruisers in first group
                            within figures Japanese are apparently prepared to discuss.</p>
                        <p>An unsatisfactory feature of this proposal as presented is that the
                            cruisers we have available for placing in the second group are of low
                            combatant value and it will be impossible for us to derive any
                            considerable benefit as far as cruisers are concerned from the
                            additional [125,000 tons] during the life of the treaty as compared with
                            Great Britain unless some satisfactory modification can be found. The
                            Japanese, like ourselves, secure no substantial benefit from second
                            group but they seem more interested in restricting first group to
                            approximately 300,000 so as to make further new construction
                            unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>In unofficial conversations, members of the Japanese technical advisory
                            group have stated that they do not favor the plan for themselves and
                            further that they recognize the plan as being obviously unfair to the
                            United States in its present form. Ishii and Saito on the other hand
                            seem favorably disposed to the plan but probably would not oppose
                            modifications which would make it more equitable for us if such
                            modifications did not force them to demand changes for themselves which
                            would require new construction.</p>
                        <p>We are giving careful attention to this scheme and to modifications
                            necessary to make it even a possible basis for discussion as we object
                            to its camouflage features. We are working on modifications which will
                            fully guard our interests and limit tonnage in a straightforward
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>With respect to further point raised in paragraph 4, your 55, we think
                            that British and Japanese would agree to some arrangement satisfactory
                            to the United States for retention by Great Britain of the four <hi

                        <p>114. Your No. 55, July 19, 4 p.m., in regard to adherence to the 5–3
                            ratio with Japan, as set forth in my telegram 106 of July 18.</p>
                        <p>In a recent informal conversation with some of the members of the
                            Japanese delegation they expressed their regret that we had not taken up
                            the question of ratio with them in detail and they indicated their fear
                            that other questions would be settled, leaving unsettled only the
                            question of ratio with Japan, and that if the Conference should then
                            fail on account of American-Japanese disagreement on ratio this would
                            bring about bad feeling between the two countries which they were most’
                            desirous of avoiding.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto we have refrained on purpose from discussing the ratio question
                            with the Japanese in detail since our disagreements with British
                            delegates seemed of such a fundamental nature that it would be bad
                            policy to raise difficulties with the Japanese as well, particularly as
                            we hoped for their support in reducing the exaggerated British tonnage
                            demands and the maintenance of our freedom to arm with 8-inch guns.
                            However, in view of the possibility that the British delegation will be
                            in a position to negotiate on these points upon their return it may be
                            necessary for us to discuss ratios and tonnage with the Japanese at a
                            very early date.</p>
                        <p>As you know, even before the Conference the Japanese were emphatic in
                            their demands that they could not take home a treaty based on the
                            minority ratio with any hope of obtaining ratification. Nevertheless, I
                            have every reason for hoping that even the encouragement which British
                            have given them to ask for a substantial modification of the ratio will
                            not lead them to forget the fact that we for our part cannot expect
                            ratification of any treaty which might substantially impair the
                            principle of the ratio. This much has already been made very clear to
                            the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In all our discussions the Japanese have indicated that they hope to take
                            home a treaty which will not require that they indulge in new
                            construction other than that already planned. It is obviously to our
                            interest that they maintain this position, particularly as it is their
                            feeling that if the treaty gave them latitude in building, popular
                            opinion would very likely compel them to do so.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0217"/>
                        <p>It is my opinion that a careful balance should be struck between the
                            unfavorable results of a small change in the 5–3 ratio and the tangible
                            gains arising from an agreement. Changes of a minor nature which would
                            enable the Japanese Government to overcome their domestic political
                            criticism while not invalidating the ratio principle should, I believe,
                            receive careful study.</p>
                        <p>Would you object to expanding the instructions you originally gave us in
                            such a way as to allow Jones and me to discuss with the Japanese, and
                            refer to you for your decision, our ideas as to methods which might be
                            adopted for reaching a compromise which would satisfy our justifiable
                            demand for the maintenance of the 5–3 ratio as well as satisfying the
                            Japanese necessity for meeting their domestic political objections?</p>
                        <p>You are, of course, aware of the Japanese dislike for the term “ratio”
                            and we have therefore endeavored to discuss the matter in terms of
                            tonnages while at the same time remaining hopeful of maintaining the
                            actual ratio figure. You might consider coming to some reasonable
                            adjustment on tonnage basis.</p>

                        <p>115. Reference is made to my telegram No. 82, of July 12, 8 p.m., and to
                            the next to the last paragraph of my telegram No. 108 of July 19, 5 p.m.
                            The draft which follows is submitted with the hope that you will let us
                            have your comments as to whether you consider objectionable a political
                            clause similar to the one contained therein. The American delegation is
                            conscious that a treaty without such a clause would be preferred and
                            will suggest such a clause only should it prove to be the sole way of
                            harmonizing our positive stand concerning freedom of action on armament
                            with the British insistence that they will be compelled to ask for some
                            rearrangement of the total tonnage limitation for cruisers if the United
                            States persists in maintaining its right to build cruisers which will
                            carry 8-inch guns.</p>
                        <p>As a practical thing, I do not believe the British would ever wish to
                            make use of such an article or that our construction program would ever
                            cause them any actual uneasiness and this was the only reason I
                            suggested the possibility of such a clause. However, it is quite
                            possible that an article of this nature might assist materially in
                            obtaining <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0218"/>British ratification
                            of any treaty which might be negotiated between the three powers at
                            Geneva.</p>
                        <p>It should be understood, of course, that the draft given below is only a
                            rough form of what such an article might include and an expression of
                            your views in the premises would be appreciated:<note n="78"

                        <p>When this matter was discussed in the American delegation, the opinion
                            was expressed that while it was improbable, from a practical standpoint,
                            that a conference would be convened by reason of any program of American
                            naval construction, nevertheless, such a clause might give rise to the
                            objection that a pretext is given to bring diplomatic pressure designed
                            to hamper legitimate construction.</p>
                        <p>This objectionable feature might be overcome by an article in which more

                            first political clause if necessity arises for it. In view of long <pb

                            travel and time required by both countries to prepare for conference it
                            might be well that 6 months’ notice be required before any meeting
                            called under this clause be held; or, the clause might be made a part of
                            general revision clause of the treaty.</p>

                        <p>62. Your No. 114, July 22, 1 p.m. My No. 55, July 19, 4 p.m., answering
                            your No. 106, July 18, 11 p.m., was intended to allow latitude for
                            slight variations which were reconxmended by naval experts at Conference
                            and reported in your No. 106, and which were approved here. Naturally we
                            have no interest in the word “ratio” and would be willing to have it
                            interpreted into actual tonnages. I should like to have recommendation
                            of your naval advisers on how much variation they would recommend.
                            Political question which must finally be decided is how far we could
                            vary from Washington treaty without endangering treaty itself. Any
                            substantial variation from the Washington treaty, as you can readily
                            see, would at once be seized upon for opposition; on the other hand a
                            variation arising naturally from inclusion of a certain number of
                            cruisers would not be serious.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: So far as I have been
                            able to follow the course of the Conference, I have nothing but
                            commendation for the position you have taken and the ability with which
                            Mr. Gibson and the Admiral have presented our position. We have made a
                            perfectly straightforward and candid presentation of a plan for
                            limitation. I do not think we should deviate from it. If others are
                            unwilling to accept it, we can very well be content with having made a
                            fair proposal and leave others with the responsibility for its
                            rejection. We should by all means keep our right to build such 10,000
                            ton cruisers <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0220"/>as we wish and arm
                            our vessels with such 8 inch guns as we wish. This statement, of course,
                            is limited by any agreement we can make with others and the right of the
                            British to build a like number. I am not in favor of the 6 inch gun and
                            small cruiser proposals. I must confess that it is very disappointing to
                            have the British position revealed to us, as it apparently shows a state
                            of mind on their part which I did not suppose existed. In my opinion
                            they are very shortsighted and can not hope to secure any advantage by
                            building a navy larger than ours. Of course, there is no other navy
                            against which they need to build.</p>

                        <p>63. The press of Great Britain is evidently trying to impress the British
                            public with view that their Government are seeking economy in advocating
                            small cruisers. <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> says that if the
                            Conference breaks down it will be clear to world that it was brought
                            about not through British intransigence but by ambitions of the United
                            States to build a big navy. While I do not wish to interfere with any
                            amicable discussion which you may be having at Geneva, I shall
                            nevertheless be compelled, if this sort of thing continues, to say
                            publicly that Great Britain is the only country which is seeking a large
                            naval program carrying with it an enormous increase in cost; that this
                            Government offered to restrict total tonnage of cruisers to 250,000 to
                            300,000 tons and is still willing to accept this restriction, but that
                            the British demand practically twice that amount; that with each country
                            given a total tonnage limitation there is no economy whatever in
                            building small cruisers but an increase in expense instead; that Great
                            Britain can construct as many small cruisers as she wishes, but that
                            this Government does not wish to construct a large number, not only
                            because they are unsuitable to our needs but also because they are more
                            costly. If Great Britain wishes to build such a size navy she is at
                            liberty to go ahead and do it without a treaty. The United States views
                            the Conference as one for naval limitation, not for naval expansion, and
                            will insist on right to equality in the Navy with any other power.</p>

                            fail to arrive at a complete accord with the British and Japanese. The
                            following have been hinted at on numerous occasions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the United States enter into a two-power arrangement with

                                <item>That cruisers should be unrestricted and an agreement
                                    negotiated covering only the two categories of submarines and
                                    destroyers;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That small cruisers shall be unrestricted and restriction
                                    placed upon 10,000-ton cruisers;</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>That an arrangement based on building program up to 1931 might
                                    be negotiated.</item>

                            indication that I am. Therefore, unless I receive instructions to the
                            contrary, I shall assume the attitude that the United States is only
                            concerned with an arrangement which would be general enough to comprise
                            all categories of naval craft.</p>

                            <item>The United States will not enter into an agreement whereby
                                10,000-ton cruisers alone are restricted, and thus leave smaller
                                cruisers unrestricted. Such an agreement would limit us on those
                                cruisers we expect to build and would allow Great Britain to build
                                an unlimited number of smaller cruisers.</item>

                                <p>“In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government there need be no
                                    difficulty in arriving at a temporary arrangement about the
                                    immediate future of cruiser building. But the British Empire
                                    cannot be asked to give to any such temporary arrangement the
                                    appearance of an immutable principle which might be treated as a
                                    precedent. Any other course would inevitably be interpreted in
                                    the first article as involving the formal surrender by the
                                    British Empire of maritime equality? a consummation which His
                                    Majesty’s Government are well assured is no part of President’s
                                    policy.”</p>

                        <p>122. This morning Bridgeman called and, although he did not reveal full
                            details of the new British proposals, he did not indicate that any
                            substantial change had been made in the previous British insistence on
                            small cruisers and armament of 6-inch guns. The delegates of the three
                            powers are having a meeting this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>126. Private meeting this afternoon of the delegates excepting those in
                            the British Dominions. After apologizing for having delayed the
                            proceedings of the Conference for over a week, Mr. Bridgeman said that
                            they were prepared to continue the discussions on the basis of the
                            memorandum quoted in my 105, July 18, 3 p.m., by adopting certain
                            variations. He then circulated a memorandum quoted my 125, July 28, 8
                                p.m.<note n="82" xml:id="d133fn82">No. 125 not printed, but see S.
                                Doc. 55, 70th Cong., 1st sess., p. 177.</note></p>
                        <p>As having seen that this memorandum contained the same objectionable
                            provision with regard to 6,000-ton 6-inch-gun cruisers I asked Mr.
                            Bridgeman whether he had presented to the British Government the view I
                            had made clear to him. See my 108, July 19, 5 p.m., as to freedom of
                            armament of all cruisers with 8-inch guns. Both he and Cecil said that
                            they had discussed this question in great detail while in London and
                            that the British Government was of the opinion that it was desirable to
                            limit for the future the armament of cruisers to 6-inch guns. Bridgeman
                            added that they could not agree to a clause which left open the question
                            of constructing other than certain specified 10,000-ton vessels with
                            8-inch guns. They then added that their last admonition from the Cabinet
                            [was that] “unless the treaty provides for the limitation of the 8-inch
                            gun the British Government feel that it would be a treaty not for a
                            limitation but for an increase of armaments.” We then made it clear that
                            under these circumstances we were apparently at a deadlock and I asked
                            whether this was their final word on this question as I was unwilling to
                            transmit their proposals with a statement that their position on the
                            8-inch gun was one of complete finality unless this were the case. They
                            then reaffirmed their position and stated that they could not go further
                            than as indicated in paragraphs 4 and 5 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of
                            their memorandum.</p>
                        <p>As we wished to place before them for submission to the British
                            Government political clause quoted my 115, July 23, 2 p.m., amended <pb
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0224"/>pursuant to your 61, July 25,
                            11 a.m., copy was thereupon distributed; but Bridgeman stated that it
                            would not meet their situation and he was sure it would not be
                            acceptable as it indirectly countenanced the construction of a type of
                            vessel which they desired to suppress.</p>
                        <p>Cecil then asked Viscount Ishii what they had to say with respect to
                            8-inch-gun question. Ishii replied that they did not wish to be bound by
                            any engagement for the future but have no plan to construct further
                            8-inch-gun cruisers prior to 1936 other than 10,000-ton vessels
                            specified.</p>
                        <p>There was then a discussion as to when a plenary session could be held in
                            order that British might “explain their proposals to the world.” While
                            we did not offer objection we said that if they wished to give us time
                            to indicate our consent with respect to their proposals after having
                            communicated them to our Government it would be necessary to wait until
                            Monday. Ishii supported this view and Monday has been tentatively fixed
                            for a plenary session.</p>
                        <p>Viscount Ishii then expressed some surprise at the new British proposal
                            regarding submarines, pointing out that instead of parity at 60,000 tons
                            a ratio of 90,000 to 60,000 was proposed and included in a total tonnage
                            for all categories. The British delegates made a rather unsuccessful
                            effort to explain their withdrawal of Admiral Field’s earlier proposal
                            to the Japanese. Admiral Jones and I felt that as we had reached a
                            deadlock on 8-inch-gun cruisers (paragraph 5) there was no useful
                            purpose to be served by discussing other features of British
                            proposal.</p>

                                    agreement in the future, even in 1931, perhaps impossible. The
                                    moral effect of such a failure, in my judgment, is out of all
                                    proportion to the material interests involved. I do not suggest
                                    that we can accept British proposition, but wish to suggest for
                                    your consideration and immediate suggestions whether it would
                                    not be better to abandon the plenary conference on Monday and
                                    take an adjournment of this conference for a few months to
                                    permit time for reflection. After a plenary conference and the
                                    position of both governments stated it will be all the more
                                    difficult if not impossible to effect any reconciliation between
                                    divergent points of view. I should wish time to consult
                                    President about this move, but while I am convinced that no
                                    treaty could be ratified on the British basis I view with great
                                    alarm a final break-up in this conference.”</p>

                        <p>71. The President at his press conference this afternoon said: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I think the Press has all the information that has come to me
                                    relative to the Naval Conference at Geneva. The proposals that
                                    have been made by the representatives of Great Britain seem to
                                    us to call for the building of a much larger Navy than we think
                                    is necessary, so that we haven’t been able to agree. Now,
                                    whether these proposals may be modified as the result of
                                    conference and discussion, I don’t know. The proposals that have
                                    been presented, as I understand them, call for the building of a
                                    larger Navy than we should wish to agree to. I think that is the
                                    main obstacle. There are some other collateral questions about
                                    the tonnage of ships and the calibre of the guns, but I think
                                    the main difference is in the size of the Navy. We called this
                                    Conference, thinking that it might result in placing a
                                    limitation on Armaments which would perhaps help the countries
                                    interested to reduce some as years went by the size of their
                                    Navies, which would result in making economies, and secondly,
                                    what I thought was of even more importance, the promotion of a
                                    spirit of peace and good will and better understanding. I have
                                    placed that, of course, as the main object in view. The matter
                                    of the removal of the burden of taxation and the economic
                                    benefits would be the natural consequences of peace and good
                                    will among the Nations. But up to the present time the expressed
                                        <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0226"/>desire on the part
                                    of representatives of the British Government is for so large a
                                    Navy that our representatives and our government haven’t been
                                    able to agree.</p>
                                <p>As I said before, I want to emphasize that discussion may modify
                                    it to such an extent that we can agree.”</p>

                        <p>137. Your No. 69, July 29, 2 p.m.<note n="85" xml:id="d136fn85">Quoted in
                                telegram to President Coolidge, July 29, <ref target="#pg_138">p.
                                    138</ref>.</note> The delegation is in complete agreement with
                            you on disastrous consequences of final break, with public statements
                            made of the differing positions. Delegation feels very strongly,
                            however, that it would be equally as disastrous were we to let it appear
                            that after having reached a deadlock over a clear-cut question we had
                            avoided issue with inference that we lacked confidence in our position.
                            Any initiative on our part for an adjournment would inevitably leak out
                            and would be interpreted as admission by us that there would be
                            possibility of making concession to British on question where on one
                            hand there is nothing but surrender of a principle and on the other its
                            maintenance. We understand that our position has the almost unanimous
                            backing of the American press. We question if this backing may not be
                            jeoparded for first time if we take the initiative to adjourn.</p>
                        <p>If we were to accept a proposal for adjournment, clearly emanating from
                            another government, however, this difficulty would be avoided; it would,
                            in fact, be obvious that our acquiescence in such a proposal would be
                            only reasonable. If you desire, suggestion can be made to Japanese
                            delegation (not revealing our initiative) that they propose an
                            adjournment to us and to the British. We believe the latter would be
                            very glad to accept such proposal; we should have to make clear,
                            however, that adjournment and plenary session are mutually exclusive.
                            Once a public stand had been taken an adjournment would be of no
                            purpose. On other hand, if adjournment be agreed on, it is obviously not
                            desirable to prejudice further discussion by making definite public
                            statements.</p>

                        <p>82. <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> this morning has despatch from
                            London that a new naval holiday plan is understood to be the result of
                            the hastily called Cabinet meeting yesterday and that the deep concern
                            of the Cabinet meeting was how to avoid and check propaganda in Great
                            Britain, the United States and Japan if present conference is doomed.
                            The article further states that the main point of the British plan will
                            be to impose a limit during an agreed provisional period during which
                            building of big fighting cruisers should not go on. British Navy would
                            undertake not to lay down further 10,000 ton cruisers during the period
                            in exchange for an American agreement not to exceed the British number
                            and a Japanese undertaking said to be already obtained not to exceed
                            three-fifths proportion in that category of warships. If the American

                        <p>139. I received a call from Ishii this morning; he informed me that he
                            had had an interview with Bridgeman last night in an endeavor to learn
                            whether there was not some way to find a basis of discussion so that we
                            might proceed with our conversations. He said it was quite apparent that
                            Bridgeman did not believe the American delegation was serious in saying
                            that it would accept no transgression of the principle of freedom of
                            armament and that he was confident that at the last moment some radical
                            concession would be granted by the United States. The views expressed by
                            the American delegation, Ishii said, he was firmly convinced were those
                            of the American Government and that he did not believe unless I knew
                            them to be those of my Government that I would have been presumptuous
                            enough to state definitely that the proposals made by the British,
                            concerning cruisers large enough to mount 8-inch guns, were totally
                            unacceptable to the United States. I paid Bridgeman a visit after
                            Ishii’s call on me and told him that I considered that I should inform
                            him that I was in receipt of a full confirmation from my Government of
                            the opinion I had given him that the British proposals concerning the
                            armament of cruisers were absolutely unacceptable to the United States.
                            He was further informed by me that I considered it necessary to request
                            a delay of the next plenary meeting, so that I might be fully informed
                            as to the views of the American Government before a final session of the
                            Conference, and I said most emphatically that should such a plenary
                            session be held it must be looked upon as the end of the Conference at
                            Geneva.</p>
                        <p>In reply Bridgeman said that on the contrary he considered that it would
                            be favorable if a full statement of our opposite opinions was <pb
                                n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0229"/>expressed, after which a final
                            appeal to the public might be made by Cecil and that we could then have
                            a private meeting at which a final endeavor could be made to reconcile
                            the views of the different delegations. The American delegation, I said,
                            was ready to accept any means of accomplishing an agreement and that it
                            was only too willing to give all its efforts and ingenuity to this end,
                            but if any real success was to come from such a private meeting the
                            endeavor should be made before another plenary session was held; that it
                            would be useless to begin negotiations all over again after we had
                            stirred up public opinion by stating in a positive manner our divergent
                            opinions.</p>
                        <p>The political clause proposed by us,<note n="89" xml:id="d139fn89">See
                                telegram No. 115, July 23, 2 p.m., from the chairman of the American
                                delegation, <ref target="#pg_131">p. 131</ref>.</note> Bridgeman
                            said, was entirely unsuited to British needs as they were of the opinion
                            that Governments would procrastinate in assuming the rights allowed them
                            by such a clause. If the United States would consent not to construct
                            more than a small number of cruisers capable of carrying 8-inch guns,
                            say two or three, besides the 10,000-ton vessels to be specified,
                            Bridgeman said he thought some solution might be found, or, if the
                            United States should incorporate in the treaty a statement to the effect
                            that it was not our intention at present to construct any cruisers
                            capable of carrying 8-inch guns besides those 10,000-ton vessels to be
                            decided upon, but that ample notice would be given should we decide
                            later to construct these cruisers. In reply I stated that I thought such
                            a statement, which could only be a conjecture, would be subject to
                            serious opposition and really had no proper place in a treaty. I said I
                            saw no objection concerning the provision for giving advance notice and
                            that as far as that provision alone was concerned it seemed entirely
                            proper. (The United States would doubtless notify the other parties to a
                            treaty of any new construction undertaken by it. See Washington treaty,
                            part 3, section 1 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>).<note n="90"

                                        >i</hi>, p. 258</ref>.</note>) The above was not deemed to
                            be sufficient by Bridgeman.</p>
                        <p>The question was then raised by Admiral Jones whether the British
                            intended, when discussing 10,000-ton cruisers, to include any craft of
                            sufficient size to allow the mounting of effective 8-inch-gun batteries.
                            In reply Bridgeman stated that such was his intention and that the
                            maximum class could include even 8,000-ton vessels carrying 8-inch
                            guns.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture, I stated that the whole question seemed to have very
                            little relation to realities, as the only question seemed to be whether
                            any construction we might undertake within the limits of tonnage allowed
                            us would be of interest to the British Empire and that considering our
                            present and past policy we were absolutely sure that this was not so.
                            The reply made by Bridgeman, in a very dry <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                                facs="0230"/>manner, was that this was not the way the British look
                            upon the matter.</p>
                        <p>I was then asked by Bridgeman if I would interview Cecil this morning and
                            see if he had anything to suggest. Of course I consented to do so and
                            paid Cecil a visit during which he proceeded to repeat just what
                            Bridgeman had previously told me. I took the matter of the postponement
                            of the plenary session up with Cecil, as I knew Bridgeman’s consent to
                            this depended upon Cecil’s assent. His reply was he would have no
                            objection to this provided I could give him some hope of agreement, but
                            if we were asking for this delay so that we might prepare an aggressive
                            and effective speech, he would certainly object. My reply to this was
                            that the American delegation did not require any time for the latter
                            purpose, as I was ready to make a full and definite statement concerning
                            the American position should they desire the session to convene
                            tomorrow, but that neither the Japanese nor American delegations
                            considered this a wise course to pursue. He then stated that he could
                            not oppose delaying the plenary session and in accordance with this an
                            arrangement has been made to postpone it until Wednesday or Thursday.
                            The British said that they might give preference to Thursday, in order
                            to allow Lord Jellicoe to be present, he having been detained in London
                            due to the death of his brother.</p>
                        <p>It was the Americans’ turn, Cecil then said, to put forth some suggestion
                            as to how the present impasse could be overcome. My reply was that I
                            considered that a maximum proposal had been made by the Americans when
                            they suggested the clause relieving the British of the obligations of
                            the treaty should they decide that the American construction program of
                            cruisers capable of mounting 8-inch guns was too offensive, and that I
                            did not see, when this had been put aside by the British as not offering
                            ground for discussion, how any minor suggestion would meet the
                            situation, but that if there was any reasonable way to smooth matters
                            out I was quite willing, as I had been from the first, to consider
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Absolutely on his own accord, Cecil then stated that he would offer the
                            suggestion that the situation might be overcome by our consenting to
                            give advance notice of our intention to construct cruisers capable of
                            mounting 8-inch guns. My reply was that I had assented to this during a
                            conversation which Bridgeman and I had previously had. The attention of
                            both Cecil and Bridgeman was called to the fact that the appeal which
                            Cecil proposed to make to public opinion would be addressed to the world
                            at large and not to the delegations at Geneva; that the United States
                            needed no such appeal to influence it to study what it considered fair
                            proposals and that I would not deem it wise to acquaint the public with
                            our divergent views before attempting to come to an agreement, as such
                            public airing of our differences <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0231"
                            />would only vex public opinion in the United States and England and
                            make it still more difficult for us to reach an agreement. All his
                            experience in public life, Cecil stated, however, had been that when
                            things apparently became hopeless, the day was often saved by an appeal
                            to public opinion. The British appear to be very averse to wrecking the
                            Conference on this issue but they have shown no disposition to grant any
                            concession up to this period. Cecil and Bridgeman both informed me that
                            they were most positive concerning the restriction to a small number of
                            maximum size cruisers capable of carrying 8-inch guns and that there
                            could be no departure from their suggestion. Therefore, we are preparing
                            the last American statement with the amendments suggested by you, as I
                            cannot see how the American and British views can be reconciled.</p>

                        <p>141. There are very insistent press reports in Geneva that Baldwin is
                            considering going to Washington to consult with you as to what course
                            may be followed to prevent the collapse of Naval Conference here. Should
                            there be any truth in this report, you may think it best to postpone
                            plenary session until after your meeting with the Prime Minister. The
                            American delegation trusts that conversations between you and Baldwin
                            may be means of bringing to his attention the broader aspects of the
                            problem. Candidly, our efforts to treat problem in broad manner are
                            restricted by Bridgeman’s incapacity to see any broader scope to
                            question. We see no prospect of slightest British concessions if matter
                            is left entirely in his hands, as he has no patience with any views

                        <p>87. Your 141, July 31, 12 p.m. I have had no indication from either
                            British Government or Baldwin of any desire to confer with <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0232"/>me on subject of the Naval Conference.
                            I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by my going to
                            Canada to see him, for I have no idea that he would change program
                            adopted by British Cabinet; in any event, he would interpret this action
                            on my part as a weakening on the part of this Government. I shall see
                            him Sunday afternoon, of course, and after the dedication exercises at
                                Buffalo<note n="91" xml:id="d141fn91">The ceremonial dedication of
                                the International Peace Bridge between the United States and Canada,
                                Aug. 7, 1927.</note> shall ride with him to view Niagara Falls, and
                            although we may naturally have a conversation on the subject I assume it
                            will be too late to talk about anything at that time. Howard called on
                            me this morning and was apparently without instructions to make any
                            concessions or any further propositions. I said that Bridgeman and Cecil
                            insisted on making speeches at plenary session not for purpose,
                            seemingly, of arriving at any compromise but avowedly of making appeal
                            to public opinion. I said that I thought that if British Government
                            desired an agreement, the making of public speeches of this kind could
                            do no good. Howard quite agreed, but did not indicate that British
                            Government intended to do anything about it. I went over whole situation
                            with him and said candidly that in my opinion the increase in naval
                            construction Great Britain proposed was not a good policy; that I failed
                            to see why any such building at this time was necessary to safeguard the
                            British Empire. I went over again the arguments for real limitation of
                            naval armaments as opposed to expansion.</p>
                        <p>Referring to article in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on subject of
                            naval holiday, Howard did not indicate whether or not British Government
                            had inspired it but he said he thought that it might offer basis on
                            which the Governments might be able to agree.</p>

                                    indirectly but clearly conveyed to the Japanese delegation they
                                    have not been responsive to it to the extent of even broaching
                                    it to us and they apparently do not wish to take any part in

                                <item>Bridgeman, I understand, paid Ishii and Saito a visit this
                                    morning during which he stated that he had no further proposals
                                    to offer and then proceeded to inquire pointedly whether the
                                    Japanese had any they wished to suggest. The impression which
                                    the Japanese delegation seemed to draw from this inquiry was
                                    that Bridgeman seemed anxious for them to propose some
                                    suggestion, possibly of a compromise nature, and consequently
                                    they have today been studying the situation to see whether they
                                    could evolve anything. Also, in an indirect manner, they have
                                    endeavored to learn just what our opinion would be regarding the
                                    submission of such proposals should the Japanese delegation
                                    succeed in discovering any to offer. The American delegation has
                                    made it plain that we would naturally welcome any proposal which
                                    would be the means of accomplishing a successful outcome, but
                                    that there could be no question of our conceding the fundamental
                                    principle which was the cause of the deadlock between the
                                    British and ourselves.</item>

                                <item>It will doubtless be necessary to convene a meeting of the
                                    chief delegates in order to compose an agenda for the closing
                                    meeting before having the final plenary session. It is possible
                                    on this occasion that the British or Japanese may make some
                                    suggestion that, instead of a debate and statement of the
                                    divergent positions of the different delegations, a statement be
                                    drafted setting forth the work accomplished by the Conference
                                    for which no solution could be found at the present time and the
                                    recommendation that the problems which have vexed the Conference
                                    be given study by the different Governments represented. It may
                                    further be advocated that the Conference recommend to the three
                                    powers represented that, should it not be possible to consider
                                    them at an earlier date, the limitation of auxiliary craft be
                                    discussed at the Conference to be held in 1931. (The Japanese
                                    delegation has indicated on different occasions that, should the
                                    Conference fail, they would favor some resolution concerning a
                                    discussion of auxiliary craft before or during the Conference of
                                    1931.) Acrimonious debate would naturally be prevented by such a
                                    final act of the Conference, but it would likewise prevent our
                                    making a clear statement, such as that already drafted,
                                    concerning the American attitude. Do you desire me to support or
                                    oppose such a proposal should it be suggested and accepted by
                                    the British and Japanese? If such a proposal should be made and
                                    supported by the British and Japanese, you may wish to give
                                    consideration to the effect of rejecting it.</item>

                                <item>In considering the program for the final session, it is also
                                    possible that a proposal may be made that three inoffensive
                                    speeches should be made after being circulated and approved by
                                    the three delegations represented. This is not favored by me and
                                    I consider that the method of procedure indicated in point 4 is
                                    much more dignified.</item>

                                    very carefully before we were in a position to discuss it
                                    intelligently. We suggested that we should call on them tomorrow

                                <p>“I think you understand that this proposal is based on the idea
                                    that Great Britain and Japan should not undertake to construct
                                    any cruisers, other than those authorized at present, before the
                                    end of 1931 and during this time should the United States desire
                                    she will be able to bring her cruiser strength up to the British
                                    strength. Of course, the word ‘authorized’ should be defined
                                    most carefully and should, it is our opinion, include only those
                                    vessels under construction and for which appropriations have
                                    been made, which would give, according to their figures, a
                                    British tonnage in cruisers of approximately 378,000 tons. We
                                    are also of the opinion that the proposal would be more
                                    acceptable if the authorized programs were expressed in total
                                    tonnage figures not to be exceeded before 1931 by either the
                                    United States or Great Britain.</p>
                                <p>As the Japanese themselves were the first to state, the draft
                                    submitted by them is only a rough outline and would need many
                                    alterations, additions and amendments.</p>
                                <p>Concerning paragraph four, we are of the opinion that it might be
                                    well at least to give consideration to the question of whether
                                    an agreement could not also be concluded now concerning
                                    destroyers and submarines so that we might have a better basis
                                    on which to work out and consolidate the limitation of auxiliary
                                    craft in 1931.</p>
                                <p>We find it difficult to understand how the Japanese suggestions
                                    could prove acceptable to the British even as a basis for
                                    discussion since this would necessitate surrender by the latter
                                    in regard to the question of eight inch guns and such a
                                    surrender would be mitigated only by the fact that the agreement
                                    would contain no mention of such guns. Therefore, even though as
                                    far as we are concerned certain points of the proposal would
                                    have to be modified, we believe that the responsibility for
                                    rejecting it, if this is done, should rest with the delegates of
                                    Great Britain, and if the latter are in reality ready to avail
                                    themselves of the suggestion of the Japanese delegates to meet
                                    our position, we ought not ourselves assume the responsibility
                                    for rejecting the initiative taken by the Japanese. Such
                                    rejection on our part might lend itself to the interpretation as
                                    a declaration that it is only upon our own terms that we are
                                    prepared to negotiate.</p>
                                <p>I saw Saito this morning with Admiral Jones and informed him that

                                    advisers it appeared that the results of such a scheme would
                                    have to be carefully studied and elaborated in greater detail
                                    before it would be possible to estimate whether it would bring
                                    about a naval holiday in reality. We suggested that Saito should
                                    communicate his idea to Bridgeman in view of the short time
                                    remaining to us. This morning he is seeing Bridgeman for this
                                    purpose.”</p>

                                    judge of it here. Surely, we would be unable to concur in the
                                    proposal that the British Empire should build up to the program
                                    which it has authorized, which would bring its total tonnage up
                                    to approximately 465,000 tons, nor is it our understanding that
                                    America’s laying the keels of 10,000 ton cruisers would be
                                    considered to prevent us from bringing our Navy to an equality
                                    with Great Britain in 9,800 ton ships or other classes of
                                    cruisers. Naturally, it would be far wiser to permit Great
                                    Britain to turn down this proposal than for us to do so.”</p>

                                    reach agreement with respect to the question of cruisers. That
                                    on that account we agree to adjournment in an effort to give a
                                    chance for negotiations directly between governments in the hope
                                    that united efforts and common devotion to the cause of naval
                                    limitation will lead in the end to the type of reasonable
                                    understanding which could alone be considered worthy of three
                                    great nations on friendly terms.</p>
                                <p>We think that a statement of this nature read at the public
                                    meeting by the Chairman of the conference would be altogether
                                    dignified and would have the tendency to sound a more reasonable
                                    note between the governments and might bring about a calming
                                    down of the recriminations which at present or in the near
                                    future make the carrying on of negotiations extremely difficult
                                    if not impossible.</p>
                                <p>As there is only a very short time now before the plenary session
                                    we hope that you can give us a decision very shortly on this
                                    subject.”</p>

                        <p>Neither one of these propositions contemplates an adjournment for a few
                            months but practically an ending of the conference with a reference of
                            their work to the 1931 conference, thus leaving it open <pb n="152"

                            possible. We have, as you know, desired to avoid recriminations but, of
                            course, if the British insist on making speeches we will do the same. To
                            make a treaty recognizing a large building program on the part of Great
                            Britain of course is inadvisable. I am in hopes that this may be

                            Japanese delegates were unable to meet us until this evening because of
                            other arrangements and Bridgeman’s lack of instructions in regard to
                            Japanese suggestion.</p>
                        <p>We first took up Japanese suggestion and, in answer to question as to
                            what was meant by “authorized programs,” Bridgeman confirmed our view
                            that this would call for approximately 458,000 tons of cruisers by 1931;
                            that their understanding was that this would involve their stopping on
                            completion of present construction of 10,000-ton cruisers but utilizing
                            other available tonnage for other cruisers so that this was merely a
                            substitution of programs and not in any sense a reduction of tonnage. I
                            was obliged to say this did not seem to offer any real limitation and
                            after I had thanked the Japanese delegation for their friendly effort to
                            find a basis of agreement Viscount Ishii stated that <pb n="153"
                                xml:id="pg_153" facs="0239"/>the idea outlined by the Japanese
                            delegation would not be put forward in the form of a proposal.</p>
                        <p>I then asked Bridgeman and Ishii if they had any further proposals to
                            bring forward. They replied in the negative.</p>
                        <p>I then raised the subject of tomorrow’s meeting and outlined very fully
                            the desirability of making a joint statement rather than separate and
                            controversial statements. I went so far as to read them large part of my
                            152, August 2, 4 p.m., and last part of your 92, August 2, 10 p.m.<note

                            any abandonment of their present plan and stated that they had the most
                            categorical instructions from the Cabinet which had been fully confirmed
                            in a telegram received this evening, that they must make a statement
                            setting forth their point of view and justifying their position. I went
                            as far as [I] could in insistence, urging the possibility of Bridgeman’s
                            telephoning to London to indicate that a preferable method had been
                            suggested and asking authority to refrain from making his statement but
                            he was unwilling to do this. In view of their obvious determination to
                            make their prepared statement we felt that it was futile to make any
                            further efforts. We then took up the question of procedure for
                            tomorrow’s meeting. It was agreed: <list>

                                        of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, met at Geneva on June
                                        20 to discuss the limitation of auxiliary naval
                                        craft.</item>
                                    <item>2. Meetings have been held from that date until the 4 of
                                        August, during which period the delegates and their advisers
                                        have considered in detail various methods of effecting this
                                        object. On many important questions provisional agreements
                                        have been reached, certain of which are embodied in the
                                        annexed report of the technical committee of the conference.
                                        These points of agreement relate particularly to the
                                        limitation of destroyers and submarines, and it was only
                                        when the conference took up the question of the limitation
                                        of cruiser class that difficulties were encountered. These
                                        difficulties proved to be of a character to render it
                                        desirable to adjourn the present negotiations until
                                        respective governments have had an opportunity to give
                                        further consideration to the problem and to the various
                                        methods which have been suggested for its solution.</item>
                                    <item>3. The American delegates presented the view that within
                                        total tonnage limitations, [which they] initially suggested
                                        should be between 250,000 and 300,000 tons in the cruiser
                                        class for the United States and the British Empire and
                                        between 150,000 and 180,000 tons for Japan, each of the
                                        powers should have liberty to build the number and the type
                                        of vessel which they might consider best suited to their
                                        respective national needs, with freedom, subject to
                                        limitation of the Washington Treaty, to arm these vessels as
                                        they saw fit.</item>
                                    <item>4. The British delegates, whilst putting proposals tending
                                        to a limitation of the size of vessels of all classes, have
                                        opposed the principle of limitation by total tonnage alone
                                        on the ground that the largest [<hi rend="italic"
                                            >larger</hi>] ship and the heaviest gun permissible must
                                        inevitably become the standard. They desired first a strict
                                        limitation of the number of 10,000 [-ton] 8 inch gun
                                        cruisers, and secondly the establishment of a secondary type
                                        of cruiser of a maximum [displacement of 6,000 tons,
                                        carrying guns of a maximum] calibre of 6 inches. The British
                                        delegates contended that the establishment of this type
                                        [would] alone enable the British Empire, within a moderate
                                        figure of total tonnage, to attain the numbers which it
                                        regards as indispensable to meet its special circumstances
                                        and its special needs.</item>
                                    <item>5. The Japanese delegates presented the view that low
                                        total tonnage levels should be fixed which would effect a
                                        real limitation of auxiliary naval vessels. As for the
                                        question of the 8 inch gun cruisers, while the Japanese
                                        Government could not agree to any restriction as a matter of
                                        principle, they had no difficulty in declaring that,
                                        provided a tonnage level of 315,000 tons for auxiliary
                                        surface vessels were fixed for Japan they would not build
                                        any further 8 inch gun cruisers until 1936, except those
                                        already authorized in existing programs.</item>
                                    <item>6. Various methods were considered of reconciling the
                                        divergent views indicated above but, while material progress
                                        has been made and the points of divergence reduced, no
                                        mutually acceptable plan has been found to reconcile the
                                        claim of the British delegates for numbers of vessels, for
                                        the most part armed with 6 inch guns, with the desire of the
                                        American delegates for the lowest possible total tonnage
                                        limitation <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0241"/>with
                                        freedom of armament within such limitation, subject to the
                                        restriction as to armament already set by the Washington
                                        Treaty.</item>
                                    <item>7. Faced with this difficulty, the delegates have deemed
                                        it wise to adjourn the present conference with this frank
                                        statement of their respective views, and to submit the
                                        problem for the further consideration of their governments,
                                        in the hope that consultation between them may lead to an
                                        early solution.</item>
                                    <item>8. Further, the delegates agree to recommend to their
                                        respective governments the desirability of arranging between
                                        the signatories of the Washington Treaty that the conference
                                        to be called pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 4 [21] of
                                        that Treaty should be held earlier than August 1931, the
                                        date contemplated under the terms of that instrument, in
                                        order that any decision reached by such a conference may
                                        come into force before the capital ship construction program
                                        commences, namely in November of that year.</item>
                                    <item>9. In making these recommendations and in submitting this
                                        statement of the points of agreement as well as of the
                                        points on which agreement has not yet been achieved, the
                                        delegates desire to place on record a statement of their
                                        conviction that the obstacles that have been encountered
                                        should not be accepted as terminating the effort to bring
                                        about a further limitation of naval armament. On the
                                        contrary, they trust that the measure of agreement which has
                                        been reached, as well as the work which has been done in
                                        clarifying their respective positions, will make it possible
                                        after consultation between the governments to find a basis
                                        for reconciling divergent views and lead to the early
                                        conclusion of an agreement for the limitation of auxiliary
                                        naval vessels which will permit of substantial economy and,
                                        while safeguarding national security, promote the feeling of
                                        mutual confidence and good understanding.”</item>

                        <p>I gave the following statement to the Press this morning concerning the
                            final session of the Conference: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I regret of course that the Geneva Conference did not succeed in
                                    making an agreement for limitation of naval armament. The
                                    Conference was suggested by the President in the hope that he
                                    could accomplish a real reduction in building programs. He also
                                    believed if the three great naval powers could succeed in such
                                    limitation it would prevent competitive building, lift enormous
                                    burdens from the countries involved, and be a great moral
                                    example to the world. We believed that there was no condition
                                    today which could threaten the security of the powers interested
                                    or justify increased building programs. It was found impossible
                                    to get an agreement either to reduce naval armament or to limit
                                    it within what we considered reasonable bounds. What was sought
                                    was to extend the principles of the Washington treaty to other
                                    naval auxiliary craft. This was found impossible without <pb
                                        n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0242"/>greatly enhancing a
                                    cruiser building program, which we thought neither necessary nor
                                    wise. I do not think the United States can afford to give its
                                    moral approval to such an expansion with all it implies. We
                                    proposed as a maximum 300,000 tons of cruisers and were not
                                    prepared to increase this by 126,000 tons and probably more in
                                    order to make a treaty. Pursuant to the Washington treaty, the
                                    United States made drastic cuts in its capital ship program and
                                    scrapped the largest capital ship navy in the world. It made
                                    greater sacrifices than any other country; in fact it scrapped
                                    780,000 tons of capital ships. It had every reason to believe
                                    that the British government was prepared to carry out a real
                                    reduction and our delegates labored earnestly and
                                    conscientiously along these lines. Japan was anxious to go even
                                    lower than the maximum set by the United States. I do not
                                    believe, however, that the general discussions which have taken
                                    place at Geneva will be fruitless and I am certain that the
                                    failure at this time to enter into an agreement will not impair
                                    the cordial relations existing between the British Government
                                    and the United States. I do not consider the failure to make an
                                    agreement now as final; and I am confident that the work done at
                                    Geneva will make it possible after consultation between the
                                    governments to find a basis for reconciling the divergent views
                                    and lead to the early conclusion of an agreement for the
                                    limitation of auxiliary naval vessels.”</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called on me today and wished to know if I had
                            any news from Geneva of which I wished to inform him. I told him that we
                            were very much pleased with the attitude of the Japanese Delegation and
                            congratulated them on their work there. That there had been no trouble
                            to agree with Japan but that we could not agree to such an enlarged
                            building program as the British government wanted. That the lowest
                            proposition they made would permit them to build at least 426,000 tons
                            of cruisers and even more if they did not build up to what they wished
                            in submarines and destroyers. They said they wanted 90,000 tons of
                            submarines and 221,000 tons of destroyers. This would leave 426,000 tons
                            for cruisers and even more if they should not build up in the other two
                            classes. We could not agree to any such program. We thought the maximum
                            proposed by us of 300,000 tons was adequate. We could not understand
                            that there was any danger to British commerce or foreign possessions,
                            since the only navies in the world amounting to anything were the
                            Japanese, the British and the United States. That if they had accepted
                            300,000 tons and allowed us to build the same number of 10,000 ton
                            cruisers and 9,800 ton cruisers as Great Britain had, with the cruisers
                            we had already there would only be 60,000 tons to <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0243"/>build and there probably would not have
                            been any trouble to agree on what size they should be. He said his
                            government was very anxious not to have a big building program and
                            wanted to know if we would have a big one. I told him I had no
                            expectation of it, but of course I could not tell. He said he had seen
                            in the papers that the President was going to call another conference. I
                            told him I had seen the President’s press statement this morning which
                            stated that he had no expectation of calling another conference before
                            1929, and as he would go out of office in March, 1929, there seemed to
                            be little possibility of it, but said I did not wish to make any
                            statement that would bar him if he should wish to do so. I told the
                            Ambassador that I had no intimation from the President that he wished to
                            do so. I asked him if the Japanese Delegation was coming back this way
                            and he said that he hoped they would but he was not sure. This was about
                            the substance of what he said.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I suppose with the
                            telegrams that we received from Geneva and instructions we gave,
                            together with the report which the Secretary of the Navy made to you,
                            you are well informed on what took place at Geneva and the reason for
                            the failure of the Conference. While the British Government assured Mr.
                            Houghton they were perfectly willing for the United States to have
                            parity on all classes of ships, Bridgeman did not make this offer in
                            Geneva at all until he was instructed by London and even in that case I
                            am assured by one of the press men who was present that when he was
                            asked the question as to whether Great Britain was willing to make a
                            treaty for parity in ships other than the 10,000 ton class, he said
                            “Well, we would have to consider that”. Undoubtedly he went there
                            intending not to grant it and every proposition there made was intended
                            to deprive the United States of an equal, effective navy. … It became
                            more and more evident that the only possible way to have a treaty with
                            Great Britain on this subject was to agree to a total tonnage beyond all
                            reason and one which would not be a limitation but an expansion.
                            Furthermore, the Navy insists that we do not want small cruisers and to
                            agree to build them would give the British a superiority owing to her
                            naval bases and make it impossible for us to have as effective a navy as
                            Great Britain. The lowest possible limit which Great Britain proposed
                            was 426,000 tons of cruisers which might be increased by building fewer
                            destroyers and submarines. In <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0244"
                            />other words, they proposed the global or total tonnage system which
                            they had opposed strenuously at the Preliminary Conference. This would
                            give them the right to build cruisers in tonnage not built in the other
                            classes. Of course, the New York <hi rend="italic">World</hi> and the
                                <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> have frequently suggested that there
                            should have been diplomatic correspondence preceding the Conference so
                            that each country would have known exactly what the other country was
                            willing to agree to. If that could have been done, no Conference would
                            have been necessary. Of course, there is no ground for this except the
                            statements of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >World</hi> and Vice President Dawes’ speech.<note n="3"

                                dedication of the International Peace Bridge, Aug. 7, 1927.</note> …
                            The most careful preparations were made, as you know. The British
                            Government was sounded out and a letter from Jones states that the
                            British went back on everything they had agreed to with him in
                                London.<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4">Letter not found in Department
                                files.</note> We had every assurance from the British Government
                            that they desired an agreement on equal terms with the United States and
                            any such tonnage as they proposed was far beyond any suggestions they
                            had ever made and beyond the tentative understanding made at the
                            Washington Conference.</p>
                        <p>Of course, I did everything in my power to make some agreement but I
                            could not recommend an agreement that did not give us parity in fact as
                            well as in principle or that would provide for an enormous expansion in
                            cruiser building. Any such tonnage as was demanded by the British
                            Government was absolutely uncalled for and unnecessary. We demonstrated
                            to them that there was not over two hundred thousand tons of cruisers in
                            all the rest of the world outside the United States and Japan; that
                            there could be no possible threat to the British Government, her
                            commerce or her possessions. Either the British Navy has gone mad or
                            Great Britain has felt compelled to continue ship building to furnish
                            employment. Perhaps both had something to do with it. I, of course,
                            regret the outcome but I do not see how we could have prevented it.
                            Personally I think it would have been perfectly simple to have entered
                            into an agreement for a building program prior to 1931 on the following
                            bases: that Great Britain should not build any additional ships beyond
                            those already laid down; that the United States would not build more
                            10,000 ton ships than Great Britain has built or is building. This, of
                            course, to include the 9800 ton ships, four of which Great Britain has.
                            This is all we could build or could reasonably expect to build between
                            now and 1931 but if we did desire to build more than this, we should
                            build the smaller size cruisers. As near as I can find out from the
                            Navy, they do not think there is any possibility of our building more
                            before that time. Great Britain did not agree to this. Apparently she
                            did not intend to <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0245"/>agree to
                            anything. It is evident that British opinion is not unanimous on this
                            subject. I enclose you an article published by a man by the name of
                            Bywater who I understand is an authority in Great Britain on naval
                                affairs.<note n="5" xml:id="d150fn5">Hector Charles Bywater, naval

                            majority of British opinion. I do not think it does. I think the
                            majority of the British opinion is that Great Britain ought to have
                            supremacy on the sea. I do not know what effect this is going to have on
                            our building program before the Congress but I think there is a pretty
                            strong feeling that we should extend our building program.</p>

                            yet received the documents incident to the session in question.
                            Therefore, inasmuch as any communications to be submitted should be in
                            the possession of the Secretariat by December 31st, I have decided not
                            to await the receipt <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0246"/>of the
                            procès-verbaux and copies of the report before submitting my suggestions
                            on this particular subject.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the first paragraph of my telegram No. 159, November 29, 6
                                p.m.,<note n="9" xml:id="d151fn9">Not printed.</note> the preamble
                            of the report of Subcommission “B” reserves “for all the governments
                            represented on it the right to make any observations that they may think
                            fit, either in documents to be submitted before December 31st for
                            distribution to the Preparatory Commission, or orally in the course of
                            the discussions which will take place in the Preparatory Commission on
                            the questions dealt with in the report”. The position of the American
                            Delegation was made especially clear by the inclusion in the same
                            section of the report of the following sentence: <quote

                                    opportunity to express its views, desires to make it clear that
                                    the views of the United States Delegation on each of the
                                    questions referred to Subcommission ‘B’ are those set forth by
                                    it on each of these questions in the report of Subcommission

                        <p>Therefore, since the relation of the American Government to the report of
                            the Joint Commission is made clear, and since all rights for either oral
                            or written comment in the future are reserved, it does not seem to me
                            that there is any necessity of submitting written comment on the subject
                            matter of the Joint Commission report before December 31st. However, in
                            the event that the Department should desire to make any observations in
                            writing at this time and to amplify in any such document the statements
                            of the American Delegation already contained in the report of
                            Subcommission “B”, I am giving below, for the Department’s convenience,
                            and as a possible basis for such a communication, specific references to
                            the position of the American Delegation as set forth in the report of

                            circulated to the governments concerned:</p>
                        <p>Refer to the decision of Sub-committee B of the Preparatory Commission
                            for the Disarmament Conference providing for the submission in writing
                            before December 31 of the views of the governments on the Joint
                            Commission Report. State that your government has received copies of the
                            Joint Commission report only within the past few days, and has not yet
                            had sufficient time to study it and make, before December 31, a detailed
                            statement of its views thereon, as it will desire to do. Therefore, your
                            Government hopes that when its views have been transmitted to the
                            Secretariat, which it hopes will be within a month, the Secretariat will
                            cause these views to be circulated to the various governments. Pending
                            the above-mentioned submission of its detailed views on the Joint
                            Commission report, your Government wishes to draw attention to the

                            Government wishes you to make it abundantly clear that it does not
                            accept the conclusions of the Joint Commission’s report, and that in its
                            forthcoming commentary concerning the Joint Commission’s report, it will
                            set forth its detailed views as to the whole of the report in

                            These misgivings appear to be based on the feeling that the Preparatory
                            Commission has achieved nothing in the way of the limitation and
                            reduction of armaments. It is clear that this is due to a
                            misapprehension as to the task of the Preparatory Commission and it
                            seems to me that I can not do better than to outline briefly for your
                            information the purpose of the Preparatory Commission and the work thus
                            far performed by it.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the Preparatory Commission was not convened for the
                            purpose of concluding agreements for the reduction and limitation of
                            armaments. It was felt that if the representatives of all governments
                            met in a conference to seek a solution of the complicated problems of
                            disarmament on land, sea, and in the air, and conclude definite
                            agreements for the limitation and reduction of armaments it would prove
                            to be a hopeless task and no definite results could be achieved. It was
                            therefore considered desirable to convene the representatives of a
                            limited number of states to conduct a preliminary survey of the general
                            problems involved and to draw up, if possible, an agenda which could
                            serve as the basis of discussion of a final conference. The American
                            Government felt that it could not fail to give its full cooperation to
                            any effort of this sort, particularly in view of the fact that it has at
                            all times earnestly advocated practical measures looking to the
                            effective reduction and limitation of armaments, and accordingly a full
                            and well equipped delegation was sent to Geneva with instructions to
                            cooperate in the most generous and friendly spirit.</p>
                        <p>You are doubtless familiar with the questions which were submitted for
                            the study of the Preparatory Commission and I need not, therefore, go
                            into them in detail. However, a copy of the Questionnaire is transmitted
                            herewith for your convenience in reference.<note n="20"

                            as to how far definite achievement will prove practicable, but it is the
                            view of this Government that so long as there is any hope of attaining
                            definite results <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0250"/>it would be

                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>When the Preparatory Commission met there were many divergent views
                            expressed as to what constituted practical solutions for the various
                            problems set forth in the Questionnaire. These problems were referred to
                            various technical subcommittees which, after discussing them during
                            several months, succeeded in eliminating a number of conflicting views
                            and narrowed the field to two principal schools of thought.</p>
                        <p>One school of thought, which is representative of the views of a group of
                            governments chiefly situated within a limited area of the European
                            Continent, may be generally indicated by five of its fundamental
                            principles: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That security must be guaranteed by some form of military
                                    assistance against aggression as a necessary condition precedent
                                    to the reduction and limitation of armaments;</item>

                                <item>That agreements for the reduction and limitation of armaments
                                    must be guaranteed by an international inspection and control of
                                    the military establishments to ascertain whether treaty
                                    obligations were being faithfully executed.</item>

                                <item>That there exists a complete interdependence of armaments and
                                    that it is impossible to deal with any single category (land,
                                    sea, or air) without simultaneously dealing with the
                                    others;</item>

                                    armaments of nations but that industrial, financial, economic,
                                    and other factors must be taken into account in any general
                                    scheme that may be drawn up;</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>That any agreements on the limitation and reduction of
                                    armaments in order to be effective must be universal and that
                                    there must be a single standard system applicable to all
                                    countries of the world.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This scheme appears to us to involve so many complicated and difficult
                            factors that its adoption would retard rather than forward the
                            limitation and reduction of armaments. Consequently at the beginning of
                            the Conference the American Delegation presented certain principles for
                            consideration which may be briefly stated as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That there should be a direct approach to the question of
                                    limitation and reduction of armaments without awaiting
                                    complicated measures for providing security, in the belief that
                                    the cause of security will be promoted through the reduction and
                                    limitation of armaments and the elimination of suspicion and
                                    ill-will which can be expected to follow;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That in order to be really effective agreements for the
                                    reduction and limitation of armaments must be founded upon a
                                    respect for treaty obligations and a belief in the good faith of
                                    the contracting parties. It is our belief that any agreements
                                    founded upon distrust and providing for a machinery of
                                    inspection and control will not only fail to achieve its purpose
                                    but will create new elements of suspicion and ill-will;</item>
                                <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0251"/>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>We believe that insistence upon a joint consideration of land,
                                    sea, and air armaments will tend to render needlessly
                                    complicated the task of a final conference and will tend to
                                    render more difficult achievement in regard to the limitation
                                    and reduction of any single category of armament. For that
                                    reason we feel that ultimate success lies along the line of
                                    isolating from the general problem as many concrete questions as
                                    possible and dealing with them in a direct and practical
                                    manner;</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>We feel that the only practical approach to the question of
                                    the limitation and reduction of armaments is through dealing
                                    with visible armaments at peace strength. We feel that this is a
                                    relatively simple problem where we are dealing with known
                                    quantities and where, through the exercise of patience and good
                                    will, we can hope for constructive achievement. We feel, on the
                                    other hand, that any scheme involving the complicated and
                                    variable industrial, financial and economic factors would tend
                                    to inject a needless complication into the problem and render
                                    more difficult any hope of real achievement;</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>It is our view that there is no possibility of devising a
                                    system for the limitation and reduction of armaments which could
                                    be made either applicable or acceptable to all countries of the
                                    world and that any attempt to reach such a solution would merely
                                    mean an indefinite postponement of achievement. We feel that
                                    land and air armaments constitute an essentially regional
                                    problem and that different solutions can best meet the needs of
                                    different regions; that naval armament can best be dealt with
                                    through direct agreement among a limited number of naval
                                    powers.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I may state, for your information, that when we entered the Preparatory
                            Conference in May, 1926, we had no previous arrangements or
                            understandings with any government. Our representatives stated our views
                            at the opening meeting and we feel that the six months discussion which
                            followed have only served to confirm the soundness of the stand taken by
                            our representatives. This is further confirmed by the fact that from a
                            position of almost complete isolation at the beginning of the conference
                            our thesis has so far commended itself to other delegations that before
                            the recent adjournment in November almost half of the conference
                            voluntarily came to support our views without any changes, concessions,
                            or abandonment of principle on our part.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that it has been a distinct step in advance to eliminate
                            many divergent views and narrow the field down to a choice between two
                            schools of thought. This work has been carried as far as it could be by
                            the technical representatives who conducted most of the discussions at
                            the first meeting. At the meeting in March the entire problem will be
                            taken up by our political representatives, whose essential duty is, so
                            far as possible, to conciliate the conflicting views which I have set
                            forth for your information and to prepare an agenda for a general
                            conference. I may say that we believe that such conciliation <pb n="166"
                                xml:id="pg_166" facs="0252"/>is possible in that we feel that some
                            features of the other thesis while not acceptable to us may be entirely
                            applicable to the special needs of other countries. Our thesis is
                            tolerant in that it seeks to understand the problems and requirements of
                            other countries and other regions, and we believe it is best calculated
                            to lead to direct and practical achievement.</p>
                        <p>My purpose in outlining these two schools of thought is to bring out the
                            necessity for the sort of preliminary work that is being done by the
                            Preparatory Commission and the hopelessness of trying to call a general
                            world conference to conclude treaties until we have reached some measure
                            of agreement as to the problems to be discussed. Until such agreement is
                            reached, it would be impossible even to draw up a programme for a
                            conference and, accordingly, the Preparatory Commission will have
                            achieved a full measure of success if it is able to present a definite
                            agenda acceptable to all governments. I feel very strongly that in view
                            of our consistent advocacy of the limitation and reduction of armaments
                            we can not withhold our full and cordial cooperation in any effort of
                            this sort to explore the subject and facilitate a practical approach to
                            the problem. Furthermore, I desire to point out, for your consideration,
                            that if after participation in the work of the Preparatory Commission
                            during the six months we now withdraw for lack of necessary funds, it
                            would not be surprising if the inference were drawn in some quarters
                            that we were not sincere in our advocacy of the limitation and reduction
                            of armaments.</p>

                            <p>The Report of the Joint Commission represents, of course, merely the
                                views of a group of individuals as to the economic effect of the
                                reduction and limitation of armament and conversely as to the
                                influence of certain economic and financial factors upon the problem
                                of reduction and limitation of armament. The views of the
                                individuals on the Joint Commission are interesting and represent a
                                considerable amount of labor. However, the applicability of the
                                conclusions reached by the Joint Commission and indeed the
                                appropriateness of taking into account the economic factors
                                suggested by the Joint Commission in approaching the concrete
                                problem of the reduction and limitation of armament are matters
                                solely for consideration and decision first, by the Preparatory
                                Commission for the Disarmament Conference, and, second, by the
                                governments represented thereon.</p>
                            <p>The American Government has noted that Sub-Committee B of the
                                Preparatory Commission has been careful to reserve for all the
                                governments represented on the Preparatory Commission the right to
                                make any observations they may think fit either in written documents
                                or orally in the course of the discussions at the forthcoming
                                meeting of the Preparatory Commission. The American Government
                                desires to make the following remarks relative to the subjects
                                considered in the report of the Joint Commission, reserving the
                                right to amplify those remarks before the Preparatory
                                Commission.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Section I</hi></p>
                            <p>This Section of the Joint Commission’s Report contemplates the
                                supervision or regulation of certain essential national industries,
                                and international agreements among such national industries looking
                                to the divulgence of certain information and the rationing of
                                manufactures. There is also contemplated a system for the collection
                                and publication of statistics of manufactures.</p>
                            <p>The American Government, as has been repeatedly stated by the
                                American Delegation at Geneva, does not view favorably any proposal
                                partaking of the nature of international supervision of the
                                administration of an agreement limiting armament. It believes that
                                the surest foundation upon which to construct such an agreement is
                                that of international good faith and respect for treaties. It
                                believes that the introduction of the element of supervision and
                                control is calculated to engender suspicion and illwill, the
                                disadvantages <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0254"/>of which
                                would far outweigh any advantages to be derived from such
                                supervision or control.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the specific suggestion of agreements between national
                                industries, it may be pointed out that in the United States, at
                                least, there might be grave legal and constitutional objections to
                                an international agreement whose effect was to compel American
                                industries to enter into agreements with industries of other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>It may further be pointed out that it is the practice of many
                                countries, including the United States, to publish periodically
                                statistics covering the production of various industries.</p>

                            <p>This Section of the Joint Commission’s Report may be divided into two
                                parts: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>The advisability of the insertion in a General Disarmament
                                        Convention of provisions similar to those contained in the
                                        Statute of the International Labor Office (Articles 411 to
                                        420 of the Treaty of Versailles) and</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>The effect, economically, of inserting such provisions in
                                        a convention regarding the prohibition of certain forms of
                                        warfare.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>As regards the insertion of such provisions in a convention limiting
                                armaments, it is noted that the Joint Commission recommends a
                                comprehensive plan of procedure, providing for investigation of
                                complaints by a commission of experts and action upon the
                                recommendation of that commission by the Council of the League of
                                Nations.</p>
                            <p>Quite aside from the fact that the United States is not a member of
                                the League of Nations and that consequently proposals calling for
                                the submission of disputes to the Council for investigation and
                                action would necessarily not concern it, the American Government
                                desires to call particular attention to the declaration in which the
                                American Delegation at Geneva joined with the Delegations of Chile,
                                Italy, and Japan in the Report of Sub-Committee A on the questions
                                contained in paragraph 2B of the report of the Preparatory
                                Commission to the Council.<note n="23" xml:id="d154fn23">Report of
                                    Sub-Commission A, p. 165.</note> The objections there set forth
                                from the military point of view to a system of control similar to
                                that contained in the Statute of the International Labor
                                Organization would seem to be equally applicable from the economic
                                point of view.</p>
                            <p>In regard to this general question, the American Government believes
                                it appropriate to reiterate here the declaration which the American
                                Delegation at Geneva made jointly with the Delegations of the
                                British Empire, Chile, Italy. Japan and Sweden, with respect <pb
                                    n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0255"/>to the question of
                                international control and supervision, the substance of which was as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… any form of supervision or control of armaments by an
                                        international body is more calculated to foment ill-will and
                                        suspicion between states than to create a spirit of
                                        international confidence, which should be one of the more
                                        important results of any agreement for the reduction and
                                        limitation of armaments. The execution of the provisions of
                                        any convention for the reduction and limitation of armaments
                                        must depend upon the good faith of nations scrupulously to
                                        carry out their treaty obligations.”</p>

                            <p>With reference to a proposal for commissions of inquiry, et cetera,
                                submitted by certain delegations,—generally similar to the proposals
                                of the Joint Commission,—the six delegations above mentioned
                                submitted the following observations: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“(1) The work of the proposed Commission would be complicated
                                        in the highest degree. It should not only be regarded from a
                                        technical point of view (military and economic), but should
                                        also be regarded from a political point of view, since, as
                                        Sub-Committee A has already shown, the primary criterion as
                                        to whether the armaments of a country are designed for
                                        defensive or offensive purposes lies in an appreciation of
                                        the political intentions of the Government interested. The
                                        Commission in question would, therefore, be called upon
                                        carefully to take account not only of military and economic
                                        considerations, but also political considerations. In other
                                        words, the Commission should be composed of quite
                                        exceptional representatives of each country, and, if it were
                                        to do its work effectively, it should in fact be a kind of
                                        International General Staff.</p>
                                    <p>“It would be extremely difficult for such a body to carry out
                                        its duties. It would be inevitably driven to encroach on the
                                        legitimate functions of these bodies which, in all
                                        countries, are entrusted by Governments with the duty of
                                        advising on the measures to be taken to ensure the safety of
                                        the State and to place it in a position to fulfil its
                                        international obligations.</p>
                                    <p>“It has been contended by others that the above use of the
                                        term ‘International General Staff’ can not really be applied
                                        to a Commission of this sort; it was further contended that
                                        the powers of such a Commission would not differ appreciably
                                        from those of many existing commissions. The six Delegations
                                        submitting this declaration do not share this opinion; they
                                        know of no body whose duties would be comparable to the
                                        duties of the Commission proposed.</p>
                                    <p>“(2) It would be very difficult for the proposed Commission
                                        to arrive at unanimous reports. More often there would be
                                        two or more divergent opinions, the choice between which
                                        would have to be taken by appeal to a higher body. In any
                                        case, in order to ensure the supervision of the execution by
                                        a State of its obligations, the Commission would require to
                                        investigate further and to complete its information and to
                                        invite that State to furnish observations and explanations.
                                        This would require considerable time, during which the
                                        situation under examination might change.</p>

                                        signatories of the Convention, it would be unduly numerous
                                        and its procedure would, therefore, be very slow. If, on the
                                        other hand, it were composed of some only among these
                                        States, the difficulty would arise of settling which of the
                                        countries adhering to the Convention should be represented
                                        on it.</p>
                                    <p>“It has been contended by others that it cannot be claimed
                                        that the creation of supervisory organizations is impossible
                                        on material or practical grounds since many precedents
                                        already exist. It is further contended that a precedent
                                        could be found in the Opium Convention and in the Statute of
                                        the International Labour Organization. The six Delegations
                                        submitting this declaration wish to point out that there is
                                        no analogy between Opium and Disarmament, and as to the
                                        extension of the Statute of the International Labour Office
                                        to Disarmament, this could not be invoked as a precedent; on
                                        the contrary, Sub-committee A had been asked to examine
                                        whether the application of that statute was possible or
                                        not.</p>
                                    <p>“(4) It is very doubtful whether the method of procedure
                                        contemplated for the proposed Commission can be in practice
                                        applied. An example will best explain the position. The
                                        commission receives reports which may possibly lead to the
                                        suggestion that in country X there are certain indications
                                        which might be considered to show that that country is not
                                        fulfilling its formal obligations, or to show the growth of
                                        aggressive intentions against country Y. What will be the
                                        position of the proposed Commission? They will find
                                        themselves obliged at once to study questions which have not
                                        only a technical, but a political aspect, and it is safe to
                                        assume that in many cases the members of the Commission will
                                        find themselves influenced by divergent political
                                        considerations. If the case is quite clear, these political
                                        considerations may be disregarded; but if, as is more
                                        probable, the position is a complicated one, then it is safe
                                        to say that these political considerations are bound to
                                        hamper an impartial inquiry. In such a situation it is to be
                                        feared that divergent opinions will come to light and the
                                        only way of removing them would be by verifying the
                                        situation on the spot. This means that a proper application
                                        of the proposed method would frequently lead to inquiries on
                                        the spot. The Delegations subscribing to this declaration
                                        consider that most unfortunate results both political and
                                        technical would follow from these inquiries. It is
                                        impossible to disregard the possibility that, in certain
                                        circumstances, one country might bring a charge against
                                        another in order to obtain, unjustifiably, information about
                                        the secret defensive organizations of the country accused.
                                        Moreover, the Delegations of the British Empire, Chile, the
                                        United States of America, Italy and Japan, are entirely
                                        unable to accept for their own Governments anything in the
                                        nature of itinerant inquisitorial Commissions.</p>
                                    <p>“It was contended during the deliberations on this question
                                        that the ‘unfortunate results both political and technical’
                                        mentioned above, which the six delegations submitting this
                                        declaration claim would follow from these inquiries, would
                                        in fact not exist since ‘inquiries of this kind have already
                                        been carried out to the general satisfaction’. Since,
                                        obviously, no such inquiries of this nature have ever been
                                        carried out in the past, it is difficult to understand how
                                        such a contention can be held.</p>

                                    <p>“(5) Further, it may be pointed out that if, in fact, it were
                                        decided to limit the task of the proposed Commission to
                                        examining, comparing and drawing conclusions from the
                                        variety of information at their disposal, the reports drawn
                                        up by the Commission would give rise to further
                                        objections.</p>
                                    <p>“From the technical point of view, any conclusions at which
                                        the Commission might arrive ‘without inquiry and direct
                                        control likely to affect the secret military preparations of
                                        the different States’ would be liable to be completely
                                        erroneous and misleading. The result might be that technical
                                        Commission would be writing reports impugning the good faith
                                        of nations without having at their disposal the essential
                                        facts such as could only be gleaned from a first-hand study
                                        of the situation on the spot. And, in general, it is
                                        inconceivable that Governments can view, without irritation,
                                        the requests for explanations which would be the result of
                                        insufficient data and which might, therefore, be regarded,
                                        according to the different circumstances of the case, as
                                        vexatious, disingenuous, or actually provocative.</p>
                                    <p>“(6) The work so far carried out by Sub-committee A proves in
                                        the opinions of the Delegations subscribing to the present
                                        declaration, that the only basis on which it is possible to
                                        hope for satisfactory and permanent results is the creation
                                        of an atmosphere of good faith. It cannot be denied
                                        psychologically and from all experience that the
                                        introduction of restrictions upon the sovereign rights of
                                        each State, tends to militate against the creation of this
                                        atmosphere. It is common knowledge that in every country
                                        restrictions of all kinds are necessary, but these
                                        restrictions have only been imposed as the result of
                                        experience and by the nation itself in the exercise of its
                                        sovereign powers. The Delegations of the British Empire,
                                        Chile, the United States, Italy, Japan and Sweden consider
                                        that restrictions of this nature should not be contemplated
                                        in international engagements except where absolutely
                                        necessary and with the fullest consent and approval of the
                                        nations concerned.</p>

                                those in the Charter of the International Labor Office, it is
                                observed that the recommendations of the Joint Commission confine
                                themselves to the typical case of chemical warfare. It is further
                                observed that these recommendations are conditioned upon agreements
                                among the national industries concerned. The American Government
                                does not consider that such agreements are in any way germane to the
                                question of the limitation of national armaments. It is well known

                            <p>This Section of the Report relates to questions concerning the
                                convertibility of chemical factories for the manufacture of poison
                                gas, and means for hindering their conversion to such use. Proposals
                                to that end are made by the Joint Commission.</p>
                            <p>The views of the American Government as to the appropriateness of the
                                conclusion of industrial agreements among chemical industries have
                                been stated above. With respect to the proposal that each state
                                undertake to establish as a crime at common law any exercising or
                                training by military persons or civilians in the use of poisons or
                                bacteria, and, in particular, the exercising or training of air
                                squadrons, it is the opinion of the American Government that such a
                                proposal is impracticable. In this connection, it may be pointed out
                                that no nation could safely agree to refrain from preparations for
                                defense against attack by chemical warfare regardless of the
                                existence of international conventions prohibiting the use of such
                                warfare. In order to prepare against attack by such warfare,
                                training in chemical matters is essential. To forbid absolutely
                                training in the use of poisons and bacteria would, in the broadest
                                meaning, put an end to chemical and medical research. Such a measure
                                would be impossible to administer.</p>

                            <p>This Section deals with the possibility of using military expenditure
                                as a criterion for the comparison of armaments, and of effecting
                                arms limitation by a limitation of such expenditure.</p>
                            <p>The conclusions reached by the Joint Commission relative to the
                                usefulness of taking into consideration military expenditures in the
                                comparison or limitation of armaments serve to emphasize the point
                                of view which has been expressed by the American Delegation on the
                                Preparatory Commission, namely, that military expenditure
                                constitutes neither a real measure for the comparison of armaments
                                nor an equitable basis for the limitation of armaments. The Joint
                                Commission’s report points out that certain groups of countries
                                having similar military organizations, similar wage levels and
                                standards of living, might profitably use expenditure as a standard
                                for the comparison of their armaments. The American Government does
                                not doubt that it might be possible for certain countries to employ
                                such a method of comparison profitably as among themselves.</p>

                                    n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0259"/>believes that the true
                                relation of budgetary expenditure to the comparison of limitation of
                                armaments is accurately stated in the declaration made by the
                                Delegations of Germany, the Argentine, Japan, The Netherlands,
                                Sweden and the United States at the meeting of Sub-Committee A of
                                the Preparatory Commission as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Delegations of Germany, the Argentine, Japan, The
                                        Netherlands, Sweden and the United States of America are of
                                        the opinion that while the reduction in national expenditure
                                        on armaments is highly desirable as one of the results to be
                                        attained by the reduction and limitation of armaments, this
                                        result would automatically follow from any effective
                                        reduction and limitation of armaments.</p>
                                    <p>“They are strongly of the opinion that monetary expenditure
                                        for the creation and maintenance of armaments does not
                                        afford either a true measure of armaments or a fair basis
                                        for limitation of armaments. They hold this opinion for the
                                        following reasons:</p>
                                    <p>“(1) The direct and indirect costs of personnel under the
                                        conscriptive and voluntary systems are so variable in
                                        different countries and in their overseas possessions and
                                        are influenced by so many different factors that these costs
                                        are practically impossible of simple and equitable
                                        conversion to a common basis.</p>
                                    <p>“(2) Due also to differences in rates of pay, production
                                        costs, maintenance charges, costs of labour and material,
                                        varying standards of living, variations in the rates of
                                        exchange and lack of uniformity in the preparation of
                                        budgets, any attempt to apply this method of limitation
                                        would be unfair and inequitable.</p>
                                    <p>“(3) The method of limitation of expenditure is an indirect
                                        method of obtaining a limitation or reduction of armaments.
                                        All methods heretofore considered have been positive and
                                        direct; the application of an indirect method seems highly
                                        undesirable as a means of accomplishing what might better be
                                        accomplished by direct methods.</p>
                                    <p>“The above mentioned Delegations maintain their opinion that
                                        from a technical standpoint armaments can be effectively
                                        limited by direct methods.</p>
                                    <p>“(4) While comparison without limitation is possible,
                                        obviously there can be no equitable limitation of
                                        expenditure by international agreement without a comparison.
                                        In other words, comparison of expenditure is a pre-requisite
                                        to equitable limitation of expenditure. Therefore, since
                                        comparison cannot be made between budgets of different
                                        countries, as has been agreed upon in the study of standards
                                        of comparison, it will be impracticable to use a budgetary
                                        method in any formula for the reduction and limitation of
                                        armaments.</p>
                                    <p>“For these reasons the above Delegations are firmly of the
                                        opinion that the method of limitation of armaments based
                                        upon the limitation of budgetary expenditure is
                                        impracticable, inequitable, and hence inadmissible.</p>
                                    <p>“Since the mandate of the Preparatory Commission calls for a
                                        reply to this question only in case the limitation of
                                        expenditure is considered practicable, and since in the
                                        opinion of the above-mentioned Delegations the method seems
                                        inapplicable, it would appear that the reply to the question
                                        submitted should be, that the limitation of expenditure is
                                        not a practicable method for the limitation or reduction of
                                        armaments.”</p>

                            <p>This Section relates to the principle upon which it will be possible
                                to draw up a scale of armaments permissible to the various
                                countries, taking into consideration population, resources,
                                geographical situation, length and nature of maritime
                                communications, density and character of the railways, et
                                cetera.</p>
                            <p>The views of the American Government are in general accord with the
                                reply to this question contained in the Report of Sub-Committee A
                                and it does not appear to be necessary to restate those views in
                                this document. It may be observed, however, that the conclusions
                                reached by the Joint Commission in reply to this question indicate
                                with a fair degree of clearness that the only factor which can be
                                applied with any accuracy is that of population and that the
                                application of this factor in the matter of limitation or reduction
                                of armaments should be merely a basis for the determination of the
                                maximum allowable amount of personnel in the armed forces.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Section VI</hi></p>
                            <p>This Section deals with the influence of the material resources of a
                                country on its war strength.</p>
                            <p>It is noted that the Joint Commission has approached the
                                consideration of this question apparently with a view to pointing
                                out those factors which it would be necessary to equalize or to
                                compensate for in order to allow the various countries of the world
                                to wage war upon one another on a more or less equal footing.</p>
                            <p>The American Government does not desire to comment in detail upon the
                                observations of the Joint Commission in this regard since it will be
                                readily admitted that in order to wage an effective war a country
                                must have either within its own borders or accessible to it
                                elsewhere the necessary supplies of raw materials, manufactured
                                goods, and financial resources. With respect to these materials,
                                each country is faced with a separate problem which, in a general
                                sense, can never be solved by artificial international agreements.
                                Those countries rich in raw materials and industrial facilities
                                cannot be deprived of that wealth nor can countries poor in such
                                wealth be provided with it except through the normal course of
                                agricultural and industrial development.</p>

                                expressed in figures.</p>
                            <p>It may be pointed out in passing that the list of the raw materials
                                indicated by the Joint Commission as essential for waging war does
                                not appear to be complete.</p>

                            <p>The final Section of the report contains the Joint Commission’s views
                                relative to the possibility of considering areas or regions of the
                                world as essentially self-supporting economically. This question was
                                raised in connection with the consideration of the practicability of
                                regional agreements for arms limitation.</p>
                            <p>The American Government believes that the problems of land and air
                                armament are particularly susceptible of regional limitation
                                agreements quite regardless of whether the regions covered by such
                                agreements might be economically self-contained or not. While the
                                observations of economic experts on this subject are perhaps of
                                interest, the practicability of regional agreements will be
                                determined eventually by political conditions and by decisions of
                                governments as to whether they wish to adopt a policy which promises
                                an immediate limitation of land and air armaments.</p>

                        <p>57. The following is authoritative, but is not yet to be made public. On
                            assembling of Preparatory Commission on March 21, Cecil<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d155fn24">Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, British delegate on
                                the Commission.</note> has been authorized to lay before it a draft
                            convention which embodies following plan: The high contracting parties
                            are to bring their proposals on strength in land, sea, and air forces
                            before the final Conference, and appropriate subcommittees are to
                            consider these proposals separately. That this plan is squarely opposed
                            to French idea of interdependence of arms is recognized, but it is
                            conceded to Cecil so that League may have all possible opportunity to
                            reach practical result through the Preparatory Commission. Admiralty
                            believes that Cecil’s draft convention will not be acceptable and that
                            impasse will be reached before Easter holidays. At all events, no great
                            time will be permitted for discussion. The Admiralty expect that the
                            Three-Power Naval Conference will meet in June.<note n="25"

                        <p>186. Preparatory Commission convened this afternoon. Cecil presented his
                            draft convention outlined in my 176, March 14, 6 p.m.,<note n="26"

                            with statement that this was merely a framework for discussion and that
                            he would welcome alternative drafts from other delegations and proposed
                            that any effort to reconcile them be made by special subcommittees.

                            beginning by general discussion of the reports of technical
                            subcommittees but that under the circumstances he was prepared to adopt
                            British method and would tomorrow or Wednesday press the alternative
                            draft embodying French views and expressed his hope that the other
                            delegations would present drafts and suggestions.<note n="28"

                            delegate read long prepared statement to the general effect that Italy
                            would not consider present armaments as a basis of discussion and that
                            regardless of the forces of other European countries Italy would demand
                            total strength equal to that of any other European country. Japanese
                            delegate read a declaration in which he associated himself with Italian
                            view that the armaments of each country must be settled entirely by that
                            country. I took no part in the discussions aside from expressing
                            satisfaction over the agreement to take British and French drafts as a
                            basis of consideration and added that the generous manner in which the
                            French delegate subordinated his preference in the method of work was a
                            good augury for future success.</p>

                            the fear which was openly expressed that failure to hold a meeting might
                            have an unfortunate effect upon public opinion.</p>

                        <p>191. The entire character of the proceedings of the Preparatory
                            Commission will change with the presentation of the British, French, and
                            possibly other texts as basis for work instead of the original
                            agenda.</p>
                        <p>The French draft is based entirely upon the idea of enforcement of the
                            Treaty of Versailles by the League of Nations; nominally the British
                            draft is also largely based on League enforcement but in this <pb
                                n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0264"/>respect its provisions are more
                            readily susceptible of being worked out by organizations and procedure
                            which does not bear the label of the League, as Cecil has indicated in
                            his statement. Such action, however, would meet with determined
                            opposition from the French bloc. We must decide how far our course of
                            action is to be affected by this change. We have two courses open to us,
                            in my opinion: (1) To continue to present our views on all questions
                            with view to having them adopted in draft of convention; (2) to set
                            forth our views making known the sort of treaty we would be in position
                            to accept and leave to other delegations adoption, or otherwise, of such
                            a draft, placing on them the responsibility for adoption of a draft
                            which would make our participation impossible.</p>
                        <p>Adoption of first course would lead inevitably, I think, to deadlock,
                            providing those who hold other views with pretext for throwing on us
                            responsibility for failure to solve problem of disarmament; certainly
                            the tension with the French would be increased, as well as with nations
                            supporting them, and it would lead to multiplicity of arguments, merits
                            of which a large part of the continental press and possibly a portion of
                            the American press would inevitably distort. I do not see how, by such
                            methods, we could arrive at a generally acceptable treaty draft.</p>
                        <p>Second method, if well presented, would enable us, on the other hand, to
                            state our views with equal clarity and would at same time allow for
                            recognition of fact that measures which we could not accept for
                            constitutional or legal reasons might be desirable and practicable for
                            other countries. Essential obstacle to a plan generally acceptable is
                            that large number of delegations desire to have entire machinery of
                            disarmament placed under supervision and control of League in order to
                            make disarmament contingent on security under League, on international
                            inspection and control, and to put measures of sanction under
                            jurisdiction of the League Council. We might express desire to enter
                            into general scheme for limitation and reduction of armaments and then
                            leave to the others the decision as to which was more important:
                            Abandonment of use of League in this matter in order to obtain American
                            participation, or agreement upon what they deemed to be effective
                            measures under League, with full knowledge that this action would
                            thereby eliminate us from any final arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I shall cable you a tentative outline of statement on this subject for
                            your consideration. If it proves acceptable I should appreciate your
                            full instructions for exact form in which matter is to be presented.
                            Urgent that I have instructions early, as the situation may develop so
                            rapidly that our attitude will have to be made clear in course of next
                            few days.</p>

                        <p>194. My 191, March 23, 11 a.m. With reference to second course proposed.
                            At today’s session of Commission, Boncour in presenting his draft
                            declared that it was only in an earnest determination to meet American
                            position that he framed provisions of his draft concerning carrying into
                            effect of convention and embodying erection of Permanent Disarmament
                            Commission; otherwise he would have preferred to utilize already
                            existing League organs. French draft, unlike British, still provides for
                            supervision and control of contracting parties’ territory.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] If second course should be adopted, however, Boncour is so
                            conciliatory that I feel that I might suggest the possibility of
                            dividing the convention into two parts, the first part to contain the
                            absolute provisions for the limitation and reduction of armaments and
                            the second to comprise those provisions which members of the League of
                            Nations might be desirous of having enforced by those agencies under the
                            control of the League. It is believed that under such circumstances the
                            members of the League could apply the second convention as among
                            themselves while we might adhere to the first with such additional
                            undertakings as might make our adherence acceptable to those states
                            members of the League. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>195. If you decide upon the adoption of the second course indicated in my
                            191 March 23, 11 a.m. I would suggest that I take an early occasion to
                            make a statement somewhat along the following lines. For example, I have
                            sought to avoid on the one hand appearing to be obstructive and on the
                            other the appearance of a swan song. There are some repetitions but they
                            are intentional to make sure of driving home essential points.</p>

                            <p>“With the submission of the drafts, which are now before us, the work
                                upon which we are engaged has assumed a new aspect. Heretofore <pb
                                    n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0266"/>we have been engaged upon
                                the discussion of a number of technical questions but now we have
                                before us texts which embody not only technical views by [<hi
                                    rend="italic">but</hi>] the political views of various
                                Governments as to the practical solution of actual problems of the
                                limitation and reduction of armaments. I cannot [but] feel this is a
                                distinct step forward on the basis of very valuable technical work
                                which has already been done. We are now in a position to begin the
                                thorough examination of the still more difficult and involved
                                political problems. While the American delegation does not feel that
                                it can usefully submit an additional draft convention, it welcomes
                                the candor which has prompted the presentation of the drafts now
                                before us which are of the greatest value in that they indicate how
                                far certain Governments are disposed to go, and secondly, the
                                methods which they feel can best solve these problems. I think I can
                                say that in a general way the drafts before us indicate certain
                                schools of thought which have been developed in the course of
                                lengthy discussions as to the most acceptable methods of limiting
                                and reducing armaments. It may best serve the avowed purpose of
                                these drafts and facilitate the work of the Conference if I offered
                                at this time certain frank comments on a type of provisions common
                                to all of them. I refer most particularly to those provisions in
                                both drafts which envisage utilizing the machinery and authority of
                                the League of Nations in carrying out the provisions of a final
                                treaty either through providing for security, the punishment of an
                                aggressor state, or international inspection and control of
                                armaments.</p>
                            <p>During the discussions of the past few days I have been greatly
                                impressed by the obvious conviction of many delegations [that] the
                                solution of the armament problem can best be found through utilizing
                                in full measure the machinery and authority of the League of
                                Nations. The sincerity of this conviction commands our fullest
                                respect, not only our respect, but a growing belief that this very
                                confidence in the efficacy of the League as an organ of peace may
                                indicate that these nations are feeling their way forward surely to
                                a solution of their problem. The American delegation believes that
                                the possibilities of such a solution deserve the most careful
                                friendly examination and if it be found that this is the way to
                                accomplish the task it will rejoice in every measure of success that
                                may be achieved. Moreover, my Government is deeply and genuinely
                                sensible of the friendliness and good will which has been shown
                                throughout these discussions in an effort to deal in a practical
                                manner with the problem created by the fact that the United States
                                is not a member of the League of Nations. As has been brought out in
                                these discussions this constitutes a difficult problem and it may be
                                that even infinite goodwill will not suffice to obtain the
                                advantages sought by those who wish to use the authority of the
                                League and at the same time make adequate [provision?] for the
                                existing difficulties created by America’s nonmembership. I am
                                confident, however, that if this extremely difficult problem cannot
                                be solved it will be through no lack of careful study and goodwill.
                                There are other governments which are not members of the League, but
                                the American Government is the only one among them which is here
                                represented to bring forward this point of view. The fact that my
                                Government is not a member of the League imposes very definite
                                limitations as to the undertakings which it is in a position to give
                                in connection with <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0267"/>a
                                convention of this sort. In the course of the discussions in the
                                Preparatory Commission and its subcommissions, it has repeatedly
                                been made clear that any convention, in order to be acceptable to my
                                Government, must take full account of the fact that it is not a
                                member of the League and further that it is not in a position to
                                subscribe to international agreements based on supervision or
                                control. I trust it will be clearly understood that I am not
                                bringing up this question in any spirit of criticism or with a view
                                to raising doubts as to the effective measures or desirability of
                                the methods. I am merely calling attention to a fact.</p>
                            <p>I realize that there is a broad difference in the possible types of
                                conventions which might be drawn up. On the one hand there is the
                                type of convention which some delegations here might be ready to
                                accept in which they would utilize in a very extended form the
                                authority and supervision of the subtreasurer. At the other extreme
                                is the form of convention which would be acceptable to my
                                Government, namely, a general international convention binding as
                                between the contracting parties and depending for its fulfillment
                                upon international good faith and respect for treaties without
                                recourse to the League.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of the views of any delegation or group-meeting of
                                delegations and regardless of the particular situation of any
                                delegation, what this Commission is chiefly concerned with is the
                                elaboration of a convention which will most effectively deal with
                                the problem of the limitation and reduction of armaments. In the
                                view of my Government everything should be subordinated to that end.
                                After the very exhaustive studies which may be made by the members
                                of this Commission it may be felt by many delegations that the
                                problem can best be solved by the adoption of a text which involves
                                the full use of League machinery and the [conferring?] of definite
                                and extensive powers on the League. If in the reasoned opinion of
                                this Commission that course will accomplish the purpose for which it
                                has been convened, my Government would not wish its special
                                situation to be considered an obstacle to general agreement. We
                                quite realize, as I have said, that a treaty utilizing to the full
                                the machinery and authority of the League might best be calculated
                                to meet the problem even if the United States should be unable to
                                become a party to it. On the other hand a treaty which takes full
                                account of the special situation of the United States in such
                                measure as to make it acceptable to us might be considered of
                                doubtful value in dealing with the situation in other parts of the
                                world and my Government above all desires that its special position
                                shall not impede the adoption of the most effective convention
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>I have ventured to set forth these views in explanation of my
                                Government’s position but I have not done this with the desire to
                                ask the Preparatory Commission to give its immediate attention to
                                this special problem. It will, I hope, be taken care of in the
                                normal course of discussion incident to the preparations of a draft
                                convention in which work the American delegation will take its full
                                share, since any decision of the Commission not to make special
                                provision for America’s status would in no way diminish our interest
                                in the general problem.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the Commission will wish to consider how far the
                                general question or problem of armaments will be affected if a draft
                                is adopted to which the United States cannot become a party. It may
                                    <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0268"/>perforce be felt that
                                the armaments of my country hardly require the measures of
                                supervision and control prescribed in the proposed convention. It
                                may also be borne in mind that with respect to naval armaments we
                                are already strictly bound as regards certain classes of ships by a
                                treaty which still has a number of years to run.<note n="31"

                                to reach an agreement which we hope will result in limitation of the
                                classes of ships not already dealt with in the Washington treaty. As
                                regards our land armament, it is well known that it has been reduced
                                to a figure far below that of any other country with anything
                                [approximating] our population and that our whole history and
                                tradition is in the direction of a military establishment reduced to
                                a minimum. While I am of course in no position to give any
                                undertaking on behalf of my Government at this time, I am authorized
                                to say that there is no present intention of materially increasing
                                our land forces. I do not wish to urge this view upon the Commission
                                but merely submit it for consideration in connection with the
                                general problem which I have raised.</p>
                            <p>My Government is thoroughly alive to the very real problems which
                                confront many of the countries here represented. It quite realizes
                                the great complexity of the query which they are now called upon to
                                meet. It is this recognition of the difficult position of other
                                countries which has led my Government to authorize this declaration
                                of its position. It feels that the problem at issue is so great that
                                it will willingly subordinate its own desire to join in this
                                convention to its still stronger desire to witness the successful
                                conclusion of a concrete achievement which, even if it should fall
                                short of the utmost desirable, would still be a most noteworthy
                                contribution to the cause of peace and an alleviation of armament
                                burdens and, it may well be hoped, constitute an incentive to
                                further accomplishments in the same field. This is a task which will
                                call not only for intelligence and industry but for great courage
                                and indefinite [<hi rend="italic">infinite?</hi>] tolerance. My
                                Government is most anxious to contribute its full share and will
                                work wholeheartedly for the success of this effort in that
                                spirit.</p>
                            <p>A number of my colleagues have referred in very friendly terms to
                                their anxiety to draw up a text which can be accepted by my
                                Government. Monsieur Paul-Boncour in his admirable presentation of
                                the French draft showed clearly that he had made an earnest effort
                                to reconcile his belief in the efficiency of League authority with
                                his desire to bring America into the final treaty. We are deeply
                                sensible of the friendly spirit which prompted him to go to the
                                lengths [to] which he has gone in [preparation?] of his draft. In
                                examining Lord Cecil’s draft it is obvious that he has been animated
                                by the same spirit. My Government on its part is most anxious to
                                find some solution of the problem which will enable it to accept a
                                draft convention which commends itself to the other members of this
                                Commission as effective and desirable. I recognize that the problem
                                is difficult but with the good <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183"
                                    facs="0269"/>will which has been shown here it may be possible
                                to find a way out. One thought which occurs to me is that some
                                method might be devised of dividing the text toward which we are
                                working into two parts—one of them to contain merely the actual
                                provisions for the limitation and reduction of armaments and the
                                other to consist of those provisions which members of the League may
                                desire to apply for their enforcement through League agencies. This
                                might be worked out in such a way that my Government could give its
                                adherence to the first convention accompanied by such separate
                                undertakings as might make this adherence acceptable to the states
                                members of the League while they could apply the second convention
                                as among themselves. I am not offering a carefully elaborated plan
                                for it is my purpose to avoid this and to offer this as one possible
                                means of meeting the problem in a way acceptable to all. It may be
                                that other delegations can suggest a still better solution and I
                                shall be very grateful if they will be good enough to give me the
                                benefit of their suggestions on this subject.”</p>

                        <p>196. Reference is made to my No. 194, March 23, midnight. The idea of a
                            double convention similar to the one I outlined to the Department has
                            suggested itself to some of my colleagues who were most anxious to
                            broach the subject this morning. To prevent this, I suggested that such
                            a proposal would be premature and that it would be embarrassing to me if
                            presented before my Government had had an opportunity to examine the
                            drafts which had been submitted, for consideration. It is apparent that
                            most of the value of this contribution would be lost to us if before I
                            can present the matter it is even hinted at by others. I would,
                            therefore, request that you let me have your decision regarding my
                            suggestion at the earliest possible moment in order to minimize the risk
                            of losing the initiative in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I am firmly convinced that our position now and in the future would be
                            greatly strengthened if the suggestion which I have outlined were
                            adopted.</p>

                        <p>98. Owing to late arrival of your telegrams on statement you propose to
                            make, it is impossible for me to examine matter carefully and advise you
                            tonight. I think, however, that in main it is too much an endorsement of
                            League supervision, as our argument has always been not only that such
                            supervision could not be accepted by us but that it is vicious in
                            principle as its only effect will be to create distrust and suspicion
                            between nations. In addition I do not think that we are justified in
                            saying that we have no intention at present of materially increasing our
                            land forces. Your draft will be considered and reply sent some time
                            tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>199. Department’s 98, March 25. The statement could not, I am confident,
                            be interpreted as a departure from the consistently maintained American
                            position. Throughout the discussions, as you will recall, the statement
                            by us that we deemed supervision vicious in principle and declined to
                            accept it for ourselves was coupled invariably with the statement that
                            no objection would be offered by us if others wished to apply it among
                            themselves. If we are not to be illogical, we must take an occasion to
                            reiterate our position either now or as soon as the question of
                            supervision comes up. Should all the other powers consider that
                            supervision by the League, applied to themselves but not to the United
                            States, does not create suspicion but is, on the contrary, the only
                            method to allay their mutual suspicions, opposition by us would not be
                            consistent and would make our position untenable. The whole delegation,
                            however, believes the statement in my 195, March 24, 11 a.m., or
                            something like it, should be made promptly. Three courses remain open to
                            us: <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0271"/>
                            <list>

                                <item>Make such a statement, thus removing any pretext for charging
                                    us with obstruction. This would leave us free to concentrate on
                                    trying to obtain in a separate convention what we regard to be
                                    essential. Also, this would clearly reveal our sincere desire
                                    for the promotion of achieved results.</item>

                                <item>Await the same proposal from France or Belgium (see my 196,
                                    March 24, 4 p.m.). Unless we anticipate them, they intend to
                                    make it in a day or so, thereby creating the impression of going
                                    to extreme limits of concession in order to make the convention
                                    acceptable to us. A refusal would be difficult, and agreement
                                    would make it appear that we accepted a favor conferred upon
                                    us.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Refuse the proposal in (2) above and fight for a general
                                    convention which would be acceptable to us. This course, in our
                                    opinion, is not to be considered. Most of the other delegations
                                    favor the use of League machinery to a greater or lesser extent,
                                    and most of them wish to apply supervisory measures among
                                    themselves. The best possible pretext to accuse us of rendering
                                    disarmament measures impossible would be afforded them if we
                                    oppose this course.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It should be kept in mind that the prospect of success for the Conference
                            is problematical at best and that, if we do meet the situation
                            handsomely, we shall leave to others the shouldering of their share of
                            responsibility for the failure. Should we advance this proposal, the
                            clearest indication will have been given that we are not fighting them
                            politically, though we may not agree with them on technical matters.</p>
                        <p>Another consideration is that some indecision is evident among the French
                            regarding their reply to our last naval invitation.<note n="34"

                            Should we remove, in a conspicuously friendly way, what they consider to
                            be the chief present obstacle in the way of their extreme League
                            program, this may help in convincing them that, though on technical
                            questions we have opposed them, no hostility to France was involved and
                            we are anxious to treat with them in a friendly and generous way.
                            Although this is pure conjecture, their decision regarding naval matters
                            might be affected thereby.</p>

                            statement that we do not intend a material increase of our land forces,
                            but this I do not deem of any consequence in comparison with the main
                            point developed by me. If you prefer, therefore, this sentence could be
                            omitted without the value of the statement being affected.</p>
                        <p>A general statement has been made by each delegation, except those of
                            Argentina and Colombia. Owing to the special position of the United
                            States respecting the League, it is felt that, until our views become
                            known, no general discussion can profitably begin. While awaiting our
                            statement, the Conference now marks time. Yesterday, <pb n="186"
                                xml:id="pg_186" facs="0272"/>however, I was informed by the
                            Conference that it would be difficult to wait later than Monday.
                            Although I do not desire to seem unduly insistent or nervous, I cannot
                            conceal the whole delegation’s feeling that the situation is the most
                            crucial developed so far during the Conference and that this factor has,
                            under the circumstances, become of the utmost importance. Therefore, I
                            trust that I may be enabled to make a general statement no later than
                            Monday morning.</p>
                        <p>The delegation has most earnestly studied the entire problem but has not
                            been able to evolve an alternative course. I cannot see how any other
                            course than the one proposed by me will prevent the United States from
                            incurring the odium of blocking the Conference. If the present
                            recommendations are not approved, I beg to be furnished with the
                            earliest instructions possible regarding the attitude I am to adopt in
                            case another delegation proposes the double convention idea and also
                            with specific instructions regarding the delegation’s future course.</p>

                        <p>99. Your No. 195 has been considered with all care possible in short time
                            given, and I do not think that your suggested statement contained
                            therein should be made to plenary conference.</p>
                        <p>(1) Fundamental objection is that other powers are deliberately
                            encouraged to set up scheme of international supervision and control;
                            and (2) very definite impression is given that only reason this
                            Government cannot join is that the United States is not a member of the
                            League.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you do not really intend statement to have that effect, but
                            certainly that is impression made on my mind, and I fear that the other
                            delegations and the public as well would receive it the same way.</p>
                        <p>(3) One of our principal objections to both the French and British drafts
                            is the provision they carry for international supervision—in your words,
                            based on punishment of an aggressor state—or for international
                            inspection and armament control. Military action or economic boycott is
                            only punishment that could be inflicted, and each is not only
                            impractical and unacceptable to this country, but, in my opinion, very
                            likely to be rejected by other countries. We have insisted constantly
                            that control of armaments as far as this country is concerned must be
                            left to the good faith of nations.</p>
                        <p>(4) I think that the American delegation should put diplomatically before
                            the plenary conference the arguments set forth in section 3, report of
                            subcommission A,<note n="36" xml:id="d164fn36">Report of Sub-Commission
                                A, p. 167.</note> by the delegates representing the <pb n="187"
                                xml:id="pg_187" facs="0273"/>Governments of the British Empire,
                            Chile, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United States. I cannot see why
                            these nations should not urge upon plenary conference the arguments
                            advanced in the report.</p>
                        <p>(5) I do not think that we impliedly should advocate a plan even for
                            other nations which we would be unwilling to accept for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>(6) I cannot go over your statement in detail, but in many passages it
                            seems to me that idea of approval of international supervision for other
                            countries is conveyed. In section 2, for instance, you state that if in
                            the reasoned opinion of the Preparatory Commission complete League
                            control will accomplish purpose for which it was convened, the
                            Government of the United States would not wish its special position to
                            be looked upon as obstacle to general agreement; and that it is fully
                            realized that a treaty utilizing to fullest extent the machinery and
                            authority of the League of Nations could best be calculated to meet
                            problem, even should the United States not be able to be party to it.
                            Our point is that we do not wish to be put in position of saying that
                            international supervision is good thing for other nations but not for
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I have no objection to offer to your making conciliatory and diplomatic
                            statement within limits here set forth and stated already in our
                            instructions. The position of this Government, reduced to its lowest
                            terms and stated in language which perhaps can be modified and put in
                            more conciliatory form may be described thus: The Government of the
                            United States cannot agree, for its part, to any form of international
                            supervision or control of armaments. This Government holds that, as far
                            as it is concerned, sole sanction for execution and enforcement of any
                            convention for reduction and limitation of armaments lies in the good
                            faith of all nations involved, naturally obligating them to a scrupulous
                            observance of their treaty obligations. The United States would have no
                            concern, therefore, in what other powers may decide to do toward
                            establishment of an international supervision or control applicable to
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Principle involved here is of broader significance than any question
                            having to do with efficacy of League machinery or of our nonmembership
                            in League of Nations. The Government of the United States is unable to
                            find itself in accord with proposals for any form of supervision or
                            control of armaments by any international body, whether League of
                            Nations or any other organization. We do not object, of course, to plan
                            of publicity proposed in section 1, part 3, Washington Disarmament
                                Conference.<note n="37" xml:id="d164fn37">Treaty for the Limitation

                        <p>201. Your No. 99 sets forth six main objections to statement I proposed
                            in my No. 195. We understand and are in agreement with them as they tend
                            to make our original intention clearer.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Objection No. 1. We shall amplify statement so as to make it clear
                                beyond doubt that our Government adheres fully to position set forth
                                in declaration to which you refer published in section 3 of
                                subcommittee A report; we shall state that we thoroughly disapprove,
                                as wrong in principle and not workable in practice, of international
                                supervision and control of armament; that not under any conditions
                                will we accept it; and that we are convinced that it is upon the
                                good faith of nations and respect for treaties that the execution of
                                any international agreement for the limitation of armaments must
                                depend.</item>
                            <item>Objection No. 2. This objection will be obviated by statement as
                                amplified under No. 1.</item>
                            <item>Objection No. 3. Amplification of statement will make clear that
                                we will not accept sanctions of nature indicated.</item>
                            <item>Objection No. 4. We are adhering fully to declaration published in
                                section 3 of Subcommittee A report. Our adherence will be made
                                clearer in statement when rewritten, and when discussions reach
                                subject of control will be dealt with more fully. On this issue
                                Germany, Italy, and some of the other powers will continue to oppose
                                the French; the better part for us is to state our position and
                                leave it to them to protect their own interests.</item>
                            <item>Objection No. 5. We are not impliedly advocating a plan “even for
                                other nations which we would be unwilling to accept for ourselves”.
                                We are adhering strictly to statements made repeatedly in pursuance
                                of your written instructions which make it clear that should other
                                powers desire to apply to themselves a regime of inspection or
                                control, this is not a matter which concerns the United States.
                                Statement I proposed will not in any way go beyond this position
                                repeatedly taken and is merely logical development of that position.
                                My No. 199, March 26, 11 a.m. indicated urgent necessity of this
                                course from strategical point of view, and our position will be very
                                greatly strengthened if we adopt it and will be seriously impaired
                                if we do not.</item>
                            <item>Objection No. 6. Your quotation from my proposed statement read
                                “machinery and authority of the League of Nations could best be
                                calculated to meet problem”; my statement read “might” instead of
                                “could” but nevertheless this portion will be omitted.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The above changes in the proposed statement seem in large measure to meet
                            your views and at same time to carry out our original intent. The
                            Preparatory Commission has begun a detailed discussion on the <pb
                                n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0275"/>coordinated Anglo-French draft
                            on land armaments, and until we shall have enunciated a general policy
                            we are in an awkward position to press our views. We request your
                            authority to redraft the statement in conformity with above changes and
                            present it as soon as we can.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the issue is not confined to the question of control should
                            be borne in mind. All the other delegations on the Preparatory
                            Commission are prepared to use the League of Nations machinery in forms
                            which would not be acceptable to us and which range from the obligation
                            to report activities to the League to provisions of elaborate nature for
                            security and sanctions. We clarify the situation and at same time
                            relieve ourselves of necessity for cooperating in any of these matters
                            if it is agreed that the convention is to be restricted broadly to
                            limitation provisions to which you could adhere. Members of the League
                            would be left free to take whatever measures they can negotiate to make
                            the convention operative among themselves. We have frequently declared
                            that any such arrangements do not concern us, and if the Conference is
                            to break down on disagreements on League matters among European powers
                            it seems highly important that we should avoid taking sides beyond a
                            statement of our views.</p>
                        <p>The cross-currents and tension here are difficult to describe. Speaking
                            with our knowledge of the situation, we feel strongly that the course we
                            propose should be taken without delay, as tension here will largely be
                            relieved as far as we are concerned and we shall be left free to
                            maintain our full thesis on what should go into a draft convention which
                            is restricted to provisions of limitation; at same time we shall be free
                            from resentment which is inevitable if we take part in what is now
                            becoming a European political fight.</p>
                        <p>All of us attach the utmost importance to idea of a double convention as
                            only means of avoiding participating in delicate discussions of League
                            of Nations problems, and as means whereby others will be left free to
                            reach agreement among themselves. As I stated in my No. 199 it is
                            important that you communicate your views without delay, for it would be
                            unfortunate were we anticipated in this proposal and I were not in
                            position where I could make some sort of response.</p>

                        <p>101. Your No. 201, March 27, 5 p.m. What we do not wish to have come
                            about is to appear before Conference and world as originators <pb
                                n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0276"/>and proponents of a formula
                            that would hereafter be known as the “American Plan”, which in effect
                            calls for joint international supervision and control of armaments for
                            every power except ourselves. Although distinction between affirmative
                            proposal and passive acquiescence may seem fine in this matter it is
                            real nevertheless. Double treaty formula may be well worth considering
                            although in working it out and putting it in practicable shape serious
                            difficulties may be encountered, but after having given question mature
                            consideration we are convinced that we ought not to accept
                            responsibility of originating suggestion. On other hand we so genuinely
                            appreciate possible embarrassment which it is evident that you are
                            feeling keenly that we are anxious to go as far as we can towards
                            meeting your views. It seems to us that our position before the
                            Conference would be quite understandable and tenable were you to speak
                            to your associates something along following lines: They have proposed
                            some form of international supervision and control; we do not believe in
                            this (give reasons) and cannot accept it; if, however, they want it and
                            insist upon it for themselves and if they can find any way by which to
                            accomplish what they desire for themselves and can at same time
                            eliminate, as far as the United States is concerned, the feature of
                            international supervision and control, then you are ready to cooperate
                            with them in sincere endeavor to find solution of that problem.</p>
                        <p>In our judgment, statement along these lines represents limit to which we
                            can go. Other delegations will then be able, as you expect, to come
                            forward with the double convention suggestion.</p>

                        <p>214. Proceedings of the present Commission forced ahead at such a pace as
                            to preclude careful work or any effort at negotiation or compromise. …
                            If work was being carried on at a normal rate most of the things we
                            wanted would be brought out in the discussions but now we must state
                            them each time lest the discussion be closed before our views are made
                            known. We are agreed that the best course for us is to let other people
                            state our views where they will; otherwise, to state them ourselves as
                            briefly as possible and in an entirely objective manner and further to
                            keep out of controversial debates except <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191"
                                facs="0277"/>where it is essential to make our views on technical
                            matters clearly of record.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the discussions have been on technical matters but at rate we
                            are proceeding we shall probably reach discussion of a number of highly
                            controversial subjects of a political character by Wednesday evening.
                            These include budgetary expenditures, supervision and control, matters
                            involving the use of League machinery in administering disarmament
                            provisions of treaty and in all probability discussions of security
                            under the authority of the Council.</p>
                        <p>These questions will arise one after another and will be the subject of
                            bitter controversy; as controversies increase in bitterness there will
                            be a fresh effort to choose a scapegoat for any failure of the
                            Commission. We are at a stage of distinct jockeying. As matters now
                            stand there are so many delicate European questions that need adjustment
                            that so far as I can gather the inclination of those countries would be
                            if possible to avoid recriminations among themselves and seek the
                            scapegoat elsewhere. If on each of the contentious questions about to be
                            considered we adopt an antagonistic attitude with no constructive or
                            conciliatory offers we must expect that there will be a serious and
                            perhaps plausible effort to hold us primarily accountable for failure.
                            We can of course make a statement in connection with each of these
                            problems that on account of our special conditions and special views we
                            will not accept or be a party to any solution involving use of League
                            machinery. But if this attitude of bare opposition is adopted we fall
                            into a very dangerous situation. It is of course possible that
                            delegations may give us a way out by suggesting a separate convention
                            but it is becoming increasingly likely that they will emphasize and give
                            wide publicity to our opposition to every proposal irrespective of the
                            League, which many of them claim is the only way of bringing about
                            effective measures of disarmament and thus make a concerted effort and
                            saddle upon us the responsibility and blame for rendering agreement
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>I am still of the opinion that a bold suggestion of a treaty limited to
                            disarmament provisions, accompanied by a protocol for its enforcement,
                            would be the most sure means of warding off the real danger above set
                            forth. In view however of your repeated instructions disapproving this,
                            the force of which I entirely appreciate, it remains to be seen if the
                            same result cannot be reached by other means. One way still appears to
                            offer hope of bringing us safely out of the delicate situation I have
                            described, while it likewise conforms to the limits laid down in your
                            recent telegraphic instructions. I therefore venture to recommend that
                            we take occasion whenever the first of these enforcement questions
                            arises to make a general statement which applies not only to that
                            particular question but to the purpose of the whole idea <pb n="192"
                                xml:id="pg_192" facs="0278"/>of League machinery and authority; to
                            make it perfectly clear that we will not accept any measure of League
                            jurisdiction, any obligation to the League for information or otherwise,
                            and that the whole idea of sanctions, supervision, et cetera, whether
                            carried out under the League or not, is thoroughly unacceptable to us;
                            that on the other hand we must recognize the fact that all the other
                            members of the committee are members of the League and that we cannot
                            stand in the way of their adopting such measures as they may deem
                            desirable no matter how impractical or unworkable they may appear to us;
                            that we would be wanting in frankness if we did not make it clear that
                            our failure to accept these reasonable measures was not due solely to
                            our nonmembership in the League but primarily because we believe them
                            unsatisfactory and unworkable; that we hope our views to this effect
                            will be given their earnest consideration as we are reluctant to see
                            them adopt any measures which in our opinion can lead to no practical
                            results; that the fundamental part of our doctrine is that the way to
                            disarm is to disarm and that the most effective sort of treaty is only
                            one which specifies the disarmament provisions upon which governments
                            are able to agree and leaves to their good faith the enforcement of
                            these provisions. In this connection I purpose to refer to the
                            Washington treaty as a successful example. We believe that any attempt
                            to control, direct or spy will inevitably tend to foster mistrust and
                            suspicion and take us farther away than ever from our common goal.
                            However if the other members of the Commission are able to reach
                            agreement among themselves for measures of this sort and really believe
                            that they will be efficacious, the American Government would not stand
                            in the way of such agreement; that of course we could not become a party
                            to it and that they might feel they preferred such an agreement among
                            themselves to an entirely different agreement to which the United States
                            could become a party; that in this event we should of course offer no
                            objection and should warmly welcome any measures of success which might
                            be achieved by their agreement. We might then say that we were sincerely
                            desirous of becoming a party to a general limitation treaty and that we
                            hoped some method could be found which would enable them to suggest the
                            measures they deemed desirable while at the same time recognizing our
                            special position and our convictions.</p>
                        <p>At this point I should throw out the suggestion that the treaty should
                            contain merely disarmament provisions leaving its enforcement to the
                            good faith of each Government. This would obviate the objection in your
                            telegram to suggesting a double convention but would leave it open to
                            some other delegate to suggest that there be a separate protocol as to
                            enforcement among the other League members. However, as indicated above,
                            the situation has so changed from that set forth in my earlier telegrams
                            that we cannot rely confidently upon <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193"
                                facs="0279"/>other delegations’ helping us out in this manner. The
                            situation needs some active stimulation. I would therefore propose to
                            take steps with a view to insuring that when I make my statement and
                            suggestion as above set forth another delegation will propose that my
                            suggestion of a limited treaty be complemented by a protocol [of]
                            enforcement as between those believing in supervision and control, and I
                            can then accept this suggestion. I feel fairly confident that I can
                            satisfactorily handle this phase of the situation.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear to me that the proposal of a single treaty confined to
                            disarmament provisions and with no proposals on our part of a separate
                            agreement among League members obviates the objection raised in your
                            101, March 29, 4 p.m., that this would be called an American plan. We
                            should be confining ourselves to a suggestion which could not be
                            distorted as you feared would be the case with my original
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Any general statement of this sort, in order to have its maximum effect,
                            should be made whenever the first question involving the use of League
                            machinery or authority arises. It will come with much lessened effect if
                            we have made reservations on one or more points and then come out with a
                            general statement. It will then look as though we had been forced into
                            it as a matter of self-protection, whereas if we do it spontaneously we
                            may get the credit of trying to find some helpful way of meeting one of
                            the definite problems of the Conference, and furthermore any stand we
                            later take on technical problems will bring less resentment than if we
                            are opposed to the continental thesis all along the line.</p>
                        <p>Commission finished first reading of air armaments today and begins naval
                            armaments tomorrow morning. I do not see how we can help getting on to
                            the question of enforcement of the treaties by Thursday at the latest.
                            An immediate action is therefore essential. Marriner will be able to
                            explain the very involved situation here which makes it imperative that
                            we lose no time in divorcing ourselves from these European quarrels and
                            confine ourselves strictly to the technical aspects of disarmament which
                            in themselves I fear offer insurmountable obstacles.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request your authorization to pursue the course outlined
                            above which, moreover, I believe falls within the limits of your
                            instructions. I may be required to take a stand on one or more of these
                            questions by Wednesday evening and hope you can give me your full
                            instructions by that time. I earnestly hope you can agree with the
                            foregoing as none of us can see any other effective way of emerging with
                            credit from the present delicate situation.</p>

                        <p>216. Commission in this morning’s session took up question limitation of
                            naval effectives. After general discussion in which I briefly stated our
                            position, the question was reserved as Cecil declared that he could take
                            no further part in discussion until he received an answer to his request
                            for instructions. While he in no way committed himself, this tends to
                            indicate that he may go some distance in meeting French thesis.</p>
                        <p>Remainder of morning session and entire afternoon session devoted to
                            discussion comparative methods of limitation of naval units by classes
                            or by total tonnage. The majority of delegates set forth their views on
                            the general subject without deviation from the position taken by them in
                            subcommittee A. Paul-Boncour, however, at the end of a speech delivered
                            with what seemed clearly deliberate moderation of tone stated that
                            France might be prepared to envisage the publication of its naval
                            building program within the total tonnage to be allocated to her. Having
                            purposely refrained from speaking until after Paul-Boncour, I took
                            occasion, after making a statement as to our attitude on this question,
                            to observe that the suggestion made by Paul-Boncour and the general
                            spirit of the remarks in which he had couched it, opened up most
                            interesting and hopeful possibilities and that we should be glad to
                            examine any proposal he might bring forward. Cecil expressed himself in
                            the same sense and requested Paul-Boncour to put his suggestion
                            precisely in writing. This the latter agreed to do. <pb n="195"

                                >Italian delegate on the Commission.</note> then said that as
                            regards publicity respecting naval building programs he thought the
                            pertinent provisions of the Washington treaty might afford a basis of
                            agreement. He also will submit his proposal in writing.</p>
                        <p>These two written proposals will probably come before the Commission
                            tomorrow and I shall then be able, if necessary, to ask for instructions
                            thereon.</p>

                        <p>221. Cecil informs me his Government is prepared under certain conditions
                            to yield to the French in regard to the limitation of naval effectives.
                            He is informing Boncour that he will be prepared to discuss acceptance
                            of such limitation provided (1) that acceptable agreement can be reached
                            in regard to some compromise such as that outlined in my 216, April 5, 9
                            p.m., and (2) that limitation of effectives is accepted by the United
                            States and Japan. He feels that while limitation of naval effectives is
                            not a sound method he can see no vital objection to it and is disposed
                            to make certain concessions to the French if this will lead them to
                            reciprocal concessions on naval tonnage.</p>
                        <p>Although we believe that the method of limitation by limiting effectives
                            unnecessarily complicates the problem and have so represented to the
                            Conference, we are not prepared to contend that it is wholly
                            inadmissible. The views of the Navy Department are especially desired on
                            the subject in view of the fact that the effectives of the Marine Corps
                            and Coast Guard will necessarily be included in naval effectives. Due
                            consideration of the fact that our air effectives are integral
                            components of the naval effectives also is necessary. This latter not
                            being the case with Great Britain or Italy will naturally affect the
                            number of effectives necessary for us in comparison with those two
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>225. Department’s 110, April 7, 6 p.m., and my 221, April 6, 5 p.m. Cecil
                            repeats that his Government is prepared to yield to the French on naval
                            effectives, providing that acceptable agreement can be reached with
                            respect to limitation of tonnage. While fully realizing that limitation
                            of naval effectives is not a good or even a practical method I feel that
                            the question has now reached a brighter phase where you may feel it
                            advisable to consider making concessions if by so doing an acceptable
                            compromise agreement can be reached on the more fundamental important
                            question of tonnage limitation. Department will of course bear in mind
                            situation created if British yield and leave us alone in opposition. The
                            possible effect of any agreement on the contemplated three-power
                            conversations will be watched and you will be kept fully advised of
                            progress. I therefore request the Department’s instructions at its
                            earliest convenience.</p>

                        <p>83. Text of memorandum from naval attaché of Embassy follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>First Lord of Admiralty informally requested naval attaché to see
                                    him, and attaché called last evening. Bridgeman emphasized that
                                    he was speaking only for the Admiralty not for the Government
                                    but expressed his views as follows:</p>
                                <p>He feared that divergent positions might be taken by the United
                                    States, Japan, and Great Britain as a result of certain
                                    proposals now <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0283"/>being
                                    made at Geneva and thought that an effort was being made to
                                    prejudice the success of the Three-Power Naval Conference by
                                    causing discord among the powers concerned at the present time.
                                    The French proposals he considered clever though impossible of
                                    acceptance and was confident that the present discussions at
                                    Geneva would yield nothing tangible. He trusted that unanimity
                                    in replying to questions raised at the present session of the
                                    Preparatory Commission might always be preserved among the three
                                    delegations. While deeming it best that no change be made in the
                                    attitude adopted last summer as regards opposition to theory of
                                    total tonnage or personnel limitation, he believed that
                                    modifications in details might for diplomatic reasons be made
                                    and that he would have no objection to them on the condition
                                    that the United States and Japan acted identically. Bridgeman
                                    laid emphasis, however, on fact that no pressure was being
                                    exerted by the Admiralty upon either of these powers to make
                                    them depart from agreements in principle already arrived at.</p>
                                <p>It was the naval attaché’s opinion that the First Lord appeared
                                    hopeful of results which the Three-Power Naval Conference might
                                    yield but that he also appeared to think that a prerequisite to
                                    its success was that the three powers should not enter upon it
                                    committed to different engagements arising out of the present
                                    negotiations. Bridgeman stated that he expected to head the
                                    British delegation, accompanied by naval officers including Vice
                                    Admiral Field. He added that the British delegation would
                                    present to the Conference proposals of an easily comprehensible
                                    kind. Commenting upon this, the naval attaché thought that the
                                    British scheme that has been formulated is not in accordance
                                    with some of the recent proposals at the present session of the
                                    Preparatory Commission which have been partially approved by
                                    some of the powers.</p>
                                <p>As Bridgeman felt that cooperation in the matter was of
                                    importance he emphasized the fact that he would be grateful if
                                    his views were communicated to the appropriate American
                                    authorities.</p>

                        <p>113. Your 225, April 9, 10 a.m. The Navy Department feels that, while the
                            French method of limitation of naval effectives is not acceptable, if a
                            workable form of limitation of total strictly naval personnel,
                            unhampered as to assignment or employment at home or abroad, could be
                            devised some compromise on this subject might be accepted, possibly in
                            exchange for some other concession.</p>
                        <p>Should Great Britain and Japan consent to limitation of naval effectives
                            as one of the elements to be taken into consideration in the limitation
                            of naval armaments, you are authorized to yield on this point as a
                            matter of conciliation, after restating our opposition to the principle
                            and after outlining the difficulties of estimating the <pb n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198" facs="0284"/>number to be used as a basis for such
                            limitation in the United States, as the Navy includes the Marine Corps
                            and also aviation units. Furthermore, the position of the coast guard,
                            which comes under the Treasury Department, would have to be especially
                            considered. You should likewise inform the Conference that you will be
                            compelled to insist on the exclusion of the above mentioned classes of
                            naval personnel from consideration in the total for purposes of
                            limitation when the question shall arise.</p>

                        <p>227. I have been informed that instructions to state that the French
                            proposal is quite unacceptable have been received by Cecil today. Unless
                            and until some agreement is reached on naval matter, Boncour holds that
                            it is futile to continue discussion of the other phases of the draft
                            convention under consideration.</p>
                        <p>In strict confidence I was told this afternoon by Loudon, chairman of the
                            Commission, that he believes these facts will be announced to the
                            Commission tomorrow during the morning session. It is believed that the
                            French and British will recognize each other’s honest effort towards
                            compromise and will come to an agreement that the best course to pursue
                            will be to adjourn immediately, in order to give the Governments time to
                            negotiate some form of agreement, in the hope that it may be possible
                            sometime in June to reconvene the Preparatory Commission. The belief is
                            held by Loudon that every effort will be made on both sides to leave the
                            door open for eventual compromise and he seems confident that there will
                            be no recriminations.</p>

                        <p>114. Your No. 227, April 10, 6 p.m. The Department, as might be expected,
                            disagrees entirely with Boncour’s position that to continue discussion
                            of other phases of draft convention would be futile without an agreement
                            on naval matters. If, however, an adjournment is desired, the Department
                            perceives no objection.</p>
                        <p>No conflict with the Three-Power Naval Conference is to be feared, in any
                            event, as the Department has maintained the feasibility of carrying on
                            these conversations during the work of the Preparatory Commission.</p>

                                printed.</note> Without any previous warning to me, Cecil injected
                            the subject of the forthcoming Three-Power Naval Conference squarely
                            into the Commission’s discussions at the outset of this morning’s
                            session. While stating that he was prepared to abandon the British
                            contention that only shore-based aircraft should be limited, he made the
                            expressed proviso that this should not prejudice any discussions to be
                            had or decisions to be reached at the forthcoming Conference and the
                            general tone of his remarks in this connection at least laid them open
                            to the interpretation that in naval matters the three powers in question
                            were more concerned with what might happen at the said Conference than
                            with the present labors of this Commission. In his reply Boncour took
                            note of this and although he did not overemphasize the point, referred
                            to “the approaching Conference which hovers above all our work here.”

                            <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0286"/>said that he would not have
                            permitted himself to refer to this subject if Cecil had not already done
                            so but that he now felt that he might properly do so. He then spoke in
                            laudatory terms of the Washington Conference, the way it had been
                            carried out, the complete appreciation in his country of the high
                            purpose of President Coolidge in calling this new Conference and the
                            independent and unconflicting nature of the latter with respect to the
                            work of this Commission.</p>
                        <p>In a brief speech I declared that although I could not believe that my
                            colleagues were under any misapprehension, yet as the matter is such a
                            vital one I wished if any such misapprehension existed completely to
                            dissipate it. I quoted from the memorandum annexed to the President’s
                            message of February 10th<note n="41" xml:id="d178fn41">Memorandum
                                transmitted in telegram No. 25, Feb. 3, 7 p.m., to the Ambassador in

                            delegation was under instructions to work wholeheartedly for the success
                            of this Commission and that the conception of a further Naval Conference
                            was as stated “in addition” thereto. I assured my colleagues that our
                            delegation had never deviated from these instructions and that its
                            efforts to contribute to the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement here
                            were not in the remotest degree subordinated to preoccupation over what
                            might eventuate in the forthcoming Conference. I added that we were
                            judging every question that comes before us here strictly on its merits
                            but that I should be lacking in frankness did I not make it clear that
                            our deep-rooted conviction of the essential soundness of the principle
                            of limitation by categories necessarily constituted for us a dominant
                            factor in considering the merits of methods of limitation of naval
                            armaments.</p>

                                <p>“Mr. President: The French and British draft conventions which we
                                    have now been engaged in examining for the past fortnight have
                                    unquestionably constituted a noteworthy contribution to the
                                    solution of the disarmament problem. Whereas in last year’s
                                    stage of the work of the Preparatory Commission and its
                                    subcommissions we were necessarily engaged in the discussion of
                                    technical questions, these drafts now embody not only the
                                    attitude taken on technical questions, but also the political
                                    views of various Governments as to the most practical <pb
                                        n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0287"/>methods of solution of
                                    the actual problem of the limitation and reduction of armaments.
                                    During the course of our present deliberations many delegations
                                    have again found occasion to reaffirm their technical views on
                                    points under discussion; nevertheless we are becoming more and
                                    more engaged in consideration of the still more difficult and
                                    involved political problems which the preparation of a final
                                    draft convention necessarily presents. The American delegation
                                    has not felt that it could usefully submit an additional draft
                                    convention but it has welcomed the presentation of the drafts
                                    now before us which are of the greatest value in that they
                                    indicate how far certain Governments are disposed to go, and,
                                    further, the methods which they feel can best solve the question
                                    at issue. In a general way the drafts before us indicate certain
                                    schools of thought which have been developed in the course of
                                    lengthy discussions as to the most acceptable methods of
                                    limiting and reducing armaments. It might best serve the avowed
                                    purpose of these drafts and facilitate the work of the
                                    Conference if I offered at this time certain frank comments on a
                                    type of provisions common to both of them. I refer most
                                    particularly to those provisions in both drafts which envisage
                                    utilizing the machinery and authority of the League of Nations
                                    in carrying out the provisions of a final treaty.</p>
                                <p>During the general discussion it was clearly the obvious
                                    conviction of many delegations that the solution of the
                                    armaments problem can best be found through utilizing in full
                                    measure the machinery and authority of the League of Nations. My
                                    Government, however, is deeply and genuinely sensible of the
                                    friendliness and good will which was shown throughout the
                                    general discussion in an effort to deal in a practical manner
                                    with the problem created by the fact that the United States is
                                    not a member of the League of Nations. As was brought out in the
                                    discussion, this fact constituted a difficult problem. I am
                                    confident, however, that if this problem cannot be solved it
                                    will be through no lack of careful study and good will. There
                                    are other governments which are not members of the League but
                                    the American Government is the only one of them which is here
                                    represented. The fact that my Government is not a member imposes
                                    very definite limitations as to the undertakings which it is in
                                    a position to give in connection with a convention of this sort.
                                    In the course of the discussions in the Preparatory Commission
                                    and its subcommissions it has repeatedly been made clear that
                                    any convention, in order to be acceptable to my Government must
                                    take full account of the fact that it cannot accept the
                                    jurisdiction of the League and further that it is not in a
                                    position to subscribe to international agreements based on
                                    supervision or control.</p>
                                <p>It will be recalled that in the discussions above referred to the
                                    delegates of the United States, as well as those of the British
                                    Empire, Chile, Italy, Japan and Sweden, set forth their views
                                    that any form of supervision or control of armaments by an
                                    international body would be extremely complicated and
                                    impractical; they also affirmed their conviction that such
                                    measures would be more calculated to foment ill will and
                                    suspicion between states than to create the spirit of
                                    international confidence which should be one of the most
                                    important results of any agreement for the reduction and
                                    limitation of armaments, and that the execution of any
                                    convention must depend upon the good faith of nations
                                    scrupulously to carry out their treaty obligations. I will not
                                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0288"/>take up the time of
                                    the Commission in reviewing the detailed objections of these
                                    delegates to any such form of supervision or control, but I
                                    should be wanting in frankness if I did not make it clear that
                                    our nonmembership in the League is not the only reason for our
                                    unwillingness to accept measures of this character. We are
                                    opposed to them primarily because we believe them unsound and
                                    unworkable. We cannot divest ourselves of the idea that the only
                                    practical way to disarm is actually to disarm, and that the most
                                    effective sort of treaty is one which specifies the disarmament
                                    provisions upon which governments are able to agree and leaves
                                    to their good faith the enforcement of these provisions. In this
                                    connection I desire to remind the Commission that there is a
                                    disarmament treaty which has now been in effect for four years
                                    and which, dependent for its enforcement solely upon
                                    international good faith, has been observed by all the high
                                    contracting parties in the most faithful and scrupulous
                                    manner.</p>
                                <p>I trust it will be understood that I am not attempting to open up
                                    again the whole question here involved but I believe it,
                                    however, my duty to state fully and frankly the opinion of my
                                    Government as to the best method of enforcement of international
                                    conventions irrespective of the consideration that it is not a
                                    member of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, this
                                    nonmembership is a fact which bears upon the framing of any
                                    convention in which my Government is to take part and I feel it
                                    advisable at the present moment once more to call attention to
                                    this fact.</p>
                                <p>A number of my colleagues have referred in very friendly terms to
                                    their anxiety to draw up a text which can be accepted by my
                                    Government. Monsieur Paul-Boncour in his admirable presentation
                                    of the French draft described the efforts he had made to
                                    reconcile his belief in the efficacy of the League authority
                                    with his desire to bring America into the final treaty. We are
                                    deeply sensible of his friendly spirit. In examining Lord
                                    Cecil’s draft it is obvious that he has been animated by the
                                    same spirit. My Government on its part is most anxious to find
                                    some solution of the problem which will enable it to accept a
                                    draft convention which commends itself to the other members of
                                    this Commission as effective and desirable.</p>
                                <p>I realize that there is a broad difference in the possible types
                                    of conventions which might be drawn up. On the one hand there is
                                    the type of convention, which some delegations here might be
                                    ready to accept, in which they would utilize in a very extended
                                    form the authority and supervision of the League. At the other
                                    extreme is the form of convention which would be acceptable to
                                    my Government, namely, a general international convention
                                    binding as between the contracting parties and depending for its
                                    fulfillment solely upon international good faith and respect for
                                    treaties without recourse to any international agency for its
                                    enforcement.</p>
                                <p>I have already set forth, and I trust with adequate clarity, the
                                    reasons why my Government is opposed to any measures of
                                    international supervision and remains firmly of the opinion that
                                    any attempt to control, direct, investigate, or inquire within
                                    the territory of a high contracting party will inevitably tend
                                    to foster mistrust and suspicion and take us farther away than
                                    ever from our common goal. I am, therefore, constrained once
                                    more to affirm the belief of my Government that a convention of
                                    the kind which we are now <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203"
                                        facs="0289"/>attempting to frame should confirm [<hi
                                        rend="italic">confine?</hi>] itself to provisions of
                                    disarmament pure and simple, leaving its enforcement to the good
                                    faith of each Government. Nevertheless I fully recognize the
                                    fact that all the other members of this Commission are at the
                                    same time members of the League. If they are able to reach
                                    agreement among themselves on measures for utilization of League
                                    machinery and believe that they will be efficacious we would not
                                    stand in the way of their adopting such measures as they may
                                    deem desirable, no matter how impractical they may appear to us.
                                    If, therefore, all the other Governments here represented desire
                                    the machinery of an international body to deal with the
                                    enforcement of the treaty, and insist upon it for themselves,
                                    and if any way can be found to accomplish what they desire for
                                    themselves and at the same time to eliminate the feature of
                                    international machinery so far as the United States is
                                    concerned, my Government is ready to cooperate with them in a
                                    sincere endeavor to solve that problem.”</p>

                        <p>16. During the meetings of subcommission A, Preparatory Commission for
                            the Disarmament Conference, Argentine representatives associated
                            themselves with the representatives of the United States, Great Britain,
                            Japan, and Chile in a declaration which supported proposal to limit
                            naval floating material by classes of ships (the method followed in the
                            Washington Conference on Limitation of Armament) in contradistinction to
                            French thesis of limitation of total tonnage only.</p>
                        <p>Our representation on Preparatory Commission at Geneva has
                                telegraphed<note n="44" xml:id="d180fn44">No. 229, Apr. 11, 10 p.m.,
                                not printed.</note> that at Commission’s meeting on April 11
                            Argentine representative declared, to Gibson’s surprise, that he
                            accepted a modified French proposal; meaning of this action is
                            abandonment by Argentina of thesis of limitation by classes.</p>
                        <p>You will endeavor discreetly to ascertain reasons for apparent change of
                            front; also if it was result of instructions. Bring matter informally to
                            attention of Minister for Foreign Affairs and inform him of your
                            surprise that abandonment in this way of our common position should so
                            suddenly take place.</p>

                        <p>40. Department’s No. 16, April 13, 4 p.m. I found it impossible, because
                            of Easter vacation, to obtain the information desired until yesterday. I
                            have now learned that Pereza, the representative of Argentina, in
                            accepting the French proposal on April 11 was acting under instructions
                            from his Government, I was informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            Doctor Gallardo, that the revised French thesis, which permitted four
                            classifications of naval units, met the Argentine requirements and
                            accordingly their representative at Geneva had been instructed to accept
                            in principle the French proposal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            further stated that, owing to the lack in the Argentine Navy of modern
                            light units and the absorption of tonnage by their two dreadnaughts,
                            which would curtail the units desired by them, they originally had
                            refrained from supporting the French plan. My personal impression is
                            that the contemplated Argentine naval program is responsible for the
                            decision and the instructions issued by the Ministry.</p>
                        <p>A confidential conference was held in the afternoon of yesterday between
                            the Ministers of Finance, Marine, and Foreign Affairs. It is believed
                            that the financing of the proposed naval program must have been the
                            subject of this conference. See the last paragraph of my telegram No.

                            President singled out American delegation alone for warm tribute to our
                            helpful attitude which had promoted good understanding. He alluded to
                            the forthcoming three-power conversations as calculated to facilitate
                            the further approach to the problem of disarmanent.</p>

                            information. Sickness of Minister for Foreign Affairs delayed
                            consideration several days, then Under Secretary assured me Chile’s
                            policy since prior to last Pan American Conference<note n="47"

                            did not believe personality had changed but he would consult Navy
                            Department in which instructions originated. This was subsequently
                            confirmed by Minister for Foreign Affairs. A few days ago Under
                            Secretary gave me a memorandum stating that, though Chilean policy had
                            not changed, its Navy Department had construed the French proposition as
                            a compromise fixing limit for total tonnage with a liberty of varying
                            within it the limit fixed for each class, thus serving what the
                            memorandum calls “a freedom for the distribution of tonnage”. This was a
                            desire entertained by Chile even at the time of Pan American Conference.
                            The memorandum of Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs says he believes
                            that there is a contradiction between the terms “limitation of tonnage
                            by categories” and “distribution of tonnage among the different types of
                            ships” and that as a result of this misunderstanding Chilean policy had
                            been changed. By this the Under Secretary evidently meant that
                            instructions inconsistent with Chilean fixed policy had been given. The
                            Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs communicated these views to
                            Under Secretary of the Navy who in turn consulted General Staff of Navy
                            whose reply had not been received at the time the memorandum was handed
                            me a few days ago. Yesterday Under Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs told me Under Secretary of the Navy told him that evidently the
                            French proposal had been misconstrued and the Chilean delegate had been
                            erroneously informed but that shortly correct instructions would be
                            given to oppose all propositions inconsistent with the idea of
                            limitation by categories. Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
                            has promised to send me copy of memorandum of Navy Department or its
                            proposed instructions as soon as received by him. I will send full text
                            of his memorandum in the next pouch.<note n="48" xml:id="d183fn48"

                            Conference should fail, necessity would arise of postponing meeting of
                            the Preparatory Commission scheduled for next November, and that he
                            intended to consult Cecil in regard to this. It was suggested to him
                            that until Naval Conference adjourned it seemed somewhat premature to
                            discuss matter. Clauzel said he appreciated that fact but that he would

                        <p>89. Your No. 148, August 1, noon. The Government of the United States was
                            not responsible for calling the Preparatory Commission and should not be
                            responsible for the Commission’s discontinuance or postponement. That is
                            a matter which is entirely in the hands of the League of Nations. If
                            continuation is desired we shall attend and if they wish to postpone we
                            shall make no objection, but they must take the responsibility. We do
                            not have any affirmative suggestions to make and we do not wish to enter
                            into any agreement on the subject.</p>

                        <p>76. Department’s 53, October 20, 10 a.m. As a practical matter I do not
                            see how an American representative could participate fully in work of
                            Security Committee. On the other hand I feel that it would be
                            unfortunate and afford pretext for criticism if we were to adopt
                            attitude of complete aloofness. Would it not avoid these extremes and
                            evidence friendly interest if Wilson were to accept invitation to sit on
                            Security Committee explaining that while he could not, in view of our
                            nonmembership in the League, join in written recommendations <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0294"/>to Council or Assembly, he would be
                            glad to follow proceedings and give from time to time, as they might be
                            desired, our views on matters of interest to the other members of the
                            Committee.</p>

                        <p>54. Your 76, October 27, 1 p.m. By resolution of the Assembly and of the
                            Council of the League of Nations, the Preparatory Commission is
                            requested to create a subcommittee or commission composed of
                            representatives of all the states participating in the Conference.
                            Consideration of the subjects of security and arbitration is the
                            declared object. It appears from a reading of the resolutions both of
                            the Assembly and of the Council together that scope of inquiry is broad
                            one; that it includes mutual covenants and guarantees of security,
                            treaties of arbitration both bilateral and multilateral, and also
                            question of sanctions for enforcement of covenants and guarantees.
                            Evidently whole subject of Geneva protocol of 1924 is in this way sought
                            to be opened again, with a view as well, perhaps, to wider application
                            of Locarno formula.<note n="51" xml:id="d189fn51">See <ref
                                    target="frus1925v01#pg_16"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    16</ref> ff.</note> Conclusion is difficult to avoid that this
                            proposal is wide departure from (at least, striking enlargement of)
                            purposes of Preparatory Commission as these were originally laid down.
                            If proposal be adopted, it would virtually establish a parallel
                            organization to Preparatory Commission. Assembly’s resolution clearly
                            expresses opinion that work of Preparatory Commission is practically in
                            suspense and that further progress cannot be made until problem of
                            security is worked out. It appears that League, instead of taking up
                            problem of security as strictly a League matter as has been its practice
                            heretofore, is adopting rather peculiar expedient of attempting to work
                            problem out through and under Preparatory Commission. Whether or not
                            this procedure is merely device to bring this Government into that
                            discussion, it is certain that the United States cannot, in any event,
                            enter into mutual covenants that guarantee security or undertake to use
                            either its military or naval forces in the application of sanctions or
                            sign arbitration treaties such as European nations seem to regard as
                            essential to their particular needs. We are inclined to believe, under
                            these circumstances, that this Government ought not to be drawn into
                            negotiations of this nature, and that should the Preparatory Commission
                            resolve itself, in effect, <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0295"/>into
                            a conference on the subject of security and sanctions, we should have to
                            consider possibility of withdrawing altogether.</p>
                        <p>Our present judgment (on which we should like to have your opinion) is
                            that of course Wilson should be authorized to attend forthcoming meeting
                            of Preparatory Commission but that he should be instructed to take no
                            part in organization of proposed Security Commission or to accept a
                            place on that Commission on behalf of the United States.</p>
                        <p>At same time it should be made plain that this Government intends to
                            continue its representation on Preparatory Commission, participating in
                            deliberations of that body and rendering assistance that it can in
                            connection with the matters embraced in the original agenda. If Security
                            Committee is eventually to report to Preparatory Commission, question of
                            what course this Government would feel obliged to follow in that
                            contingency would naturally command our consideration at that time.</p>

                        <p>79. Department’s No. 54, November 8, 6 p.m. I consider it important that
                            we be represented on Security Committee as discussions in that Committee
                            will be constantly referred to in subsequent sessions of Preparatory
                            Commission. This in no way commits us, as discussions in Security
                            Committee will be of purely preparatory character like those of
                            Preparatory Commisison; when strictly League of Nations questions are
                            discussed our representative can make our nonparticipation clear by a
                            reminder of our nonmembership, as we have always done in such cases in
                            the past. The Committee will doubtless involve itself in inconclusive
                            discussions regarding application of the Covenant and revival of the
                            Geneva protocol. Our representative, in that event, will automatically
                            revert to role of observer. He will be in position, however, to correct
                            any misstatements which will be made from time to time.</p>
                        <p>Should we refuse to participate, past experience justifies belief that
                            effort will be made to convince public opinion that it was with a desire
                            to further consideration of disarmament that Security Committee had been
                            set up to devise some method of creating security that would be
                            acceptable to the League and the United States alike; and that because
                            of our prejudice against the League of Nations, we had refused even <pb
                                n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0296"/>to listen to the discussion and
                            that we had thereby blocked effectively any further progress. We avoid
                            this by having someone present and letting the others demonstrate that
                            they are not able to agree among themselves upon any security
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The Department might consider giving authorization to Wilson to point out
                            that several years ago we joined in a four-power treaty<note n="52"
                                xml:id="d190fn52">Treaty between the United States of America, the
                                British Empire, France, and Japan, signed at Washington, Dec. 13,
                                1921; <ref target="frus1922v01#pg_33"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1922, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p.
                                    33</ref>.</note> and that we consider this treaty (as we hope
                            that the other signatories also consider it) is entirely adequate for
                            security in its special terminology; and also that having accomplished
                            this to meet our own needs we view the endeavors of the continental
                            powers to solve their difficulties with the greatest sympathy. To do
                            this would focus attention on that important treaty, would show our
                            sympathy for the efforts of others, and would afford opportunity to
                            indicate how they must work out their problem as a practical matter as
                            we have done. A statement of this sort, carefully prepared, could
                            demonstrate effectively that there is no justification for any attempt
                            to hide behind our skirts and to assert that the nations of Europe
                            cannot reach agreements among themselves for the reason that we will not
                            accept League jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Of course, I agree that the discussions in the Committee might assume a
                            character which would make desirable our withdrawal altogether from the
                            Committee, but before that step is decided upon it seems to me that it
                            is desirable to get some of the foregoing ideas clearly on record.</p>

                                facs="0297"/>Commission that in 1921 this Government concluded what
                            might be denominated a security agreement with the Governments of Great
                            Britain, France, and Japan for the Preservation of the General Peace and
                            the Maintenance of Rights in Relation to Insular Possessions and
                            Dominions in the Region of the Pacific Ocean. You may add that the
                            Government of the United States believes, as we hope the other
                            signatories believe, that this treaty is entirely adequate for security
                            in its special field; that for that reason we look with greatest
                            sympathy on endeavors of the continental powers to solve their
                            difficulties in some similar manner, having recourse to machinery which
                            is at their disposal. The fact is well known, furthermore, that the
                            Government of the United States has always favored international
                            arbitration and conciliation in principle and in practice; that it has
                            entered into many bilateral treaties of arbitration and conciliation
                            with various nations; that at any time it would be pleased to add to the
                            number of these treaties which, if observed in good faith, it is
                            believed will reduce to a minimum the danger of aggressive war. In view
                            of its traditional policy of noninterference in European affairs and
                            also in view of fact that it is not a member of the League of Nations,
                            the American Government believes that it would be unable usefully to
                            cooperate in the labors of the Committee the establishment of which is
                            proposed. The American Government will be prepared, when a general
                            disarmament conference may be called, to consider in light of its
                            historic policy the recommendations made by a Security Committee working
                            parallel with the Preparatory Commission, in whose labors this
                            Government intends to continue its wholehearted cooperation.</p>

                        <p>97. It is my belief that American sympathy with all endeavors to
                            encourage disarmament can be made evident without representation of the
                            United States on the Security Committee.</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>If there are likely to be efforts made to throw on this Government the
                            blame for a possible failure to obtain results, it seems that this could
                            more plausibly be done if the United States were represented on the
                            Security Committee as an active participant; for, by reason of the fact
                            that the United States is not a member of the League of Nations and also
                            because of other conditions peculiar to this country, it would be
                            especially difficult to avoid appearance of obstructing Committee’s
                            deliberations in event that representatives of other nations made
                            deliberate effort to put the United States in a false position.</p>
                        <p>Should there be representation by an observer only, appearance of
                            obstruction might also be brought about by fact that an observer would
                            not be, naturally, in a position to offer constructive suggestions;
                            instead, he would be compelled to call attention to strict limits which
                            circumstances impose upon extent of formal American cooperation.</p>
                        <p>At meeting of Preparatory Commission when creation of Security Committee
                            is under discussion, you might propose, or arrange to have proposed in
                            interests of closer understanding and cooperation that procès-verbaux of
                            meetings of the Committee be made available to members of the Commission
                            and likewise that the procès-verbaux of the Commission be made available
                            to the Committee.</p>
                        <p>If the United States should not be represented on the Committee,
                            misrepresentation of the American point of view would do little harm to
                            this Government if not made public, and if it were made public it could
                            be answered by appropriate statements to the press either at Geneva or
                            here.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that a statement on the attitude of the United States,
                            which embodies point 1 of Department’s 95, March 22, 6 p.m., to Gibson,
                            could be made if necessary at a subsequent meeting of the Preparatory
                            Commission itself next year, or anyway at the final disarmament
                            conference toward which both the Commission and the Committee will
                            work.</p>
                        <p>In view of foregoing instructions, you will follow Department’s
                            instruction 94, telegraphed November 15, noon. Should it become
                            desirable or necessary, in your opinion, you may add to your statement
                            on the American position by pointing out analogy between attitude Gibson

                                    should receive early consideration by the different

                        <p>The Assembly and the Council of the League of Nations have several times
                            put on record the importance which they attach to the question of the
                            supervision of the private manufacture of arms and ammunition and of
                            implements of war in connection with that of the supervision of the
                            international trade, and notably in the following passage of a report
                            adopted by the Council on September 26th, 1925:— <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Council has taken note of the Resolution adopted by the
                                    Sixth Assembly on the supervision of the manufacture of arms and
                                    ammunition and of implements of war. The Council is aware, as
                                    pointed out in M. Guerrero’s Report, which was adopted by the
                                    Assembly, that this Resolution was prompted by two currents of
                                    opinion. On the one hand, all the Assemblies have shown a desire
                                    to put into operation the provisions of Article 8 of the
                                    Covenant with regard to the supervision of the private
                                    manufacture of arms and ammunition and of implements of war. On
                                    the other hand, at the Conference of May-June, 1925, on the
                                    Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition
                                    and in Implements of War, there was a strong tendency to assert
                                    the equality of non-producing and producing States. The
                                    non-producing States pointed out that, as the Convention for the
                                    Supervision of International Trade subjected the purchase of
                                    arms to <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0301"/>the regime of
                                    publicity, the producing States must, in order to re-establish
                                    equality, accept the same principle of publicity by concluding a
                                    Convention on the supervision of manufacture”.</p>

                                December 17, 1926, in which he was good enough to invite the
                                American Government to appoint a representative to sit as a member
                                of a Special Commission created by the Council of the League of
                                Nations, to meet at Geneva, March 14, 1927, to consider a draft
                                convention with regard to the private manufacture of arms and
                                ammunition and of implements of war, and to prepare a final draft
                                which might serve as a basis for an international conference. It has
                                been noted that the preparation of such a draft convention is stated
                                by Sir Eric Drummond to have been decided upon by the Council of the
                                League on December 12, 1925, as the outcome of a resolution of the
                                Assembly of the League endorsing the declaration inserted in the
                                Final Act of the International Conference for the Supervision of the
                                International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War,
                                the purport of which was that the international aspect of ‘the
                                manufacture of such Arms and Ammunition and Implements of War’
                                should be given consideration by the different Governments.</p>
                            <p>It is further noted that Sir Eric Drummond draws attention to a
                                passage in the Report adopted by the Council on December 9, 1926,
                                    <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0302"/>which based the hope of
                                American participation in the forthcoming meeting of the Special
                                Commission upon certain statements made by the Honorable Theodore E.
                                Burton, Chairman of the American delegation at the Conference for
                                the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition
                                and in Implements of War.</p>
                            <p>The statements of Mr. Burton to which reference is made were
                                substantially to the following effect, viz: 1) that the United
                                States Government has for many years collected and published
                                statistics covering the production in this country of arms and
                                ammunition, 2) that the United States would be willing to enter a
                                suitable international agreement providing for the publication of
                                such statistics by the governments parties thereto, 3) that such an
                                agreement, to be effective, should cover the manufacture of arms and
                                ammunition in both private and government factories.</p>
                            <p>The American Government believes that the principles enunciated by
                                Mr. Burton would provide a sound basis for an international
                                convention, and therefore has been pleased to designate the
                                Honorable Hugh S. Gibson, American Minister to Switzerland, to
                                attend the meeting of the Special Commission.”</p>

                            control and suggested the following measures as likely to render that

                        <p>It was realized, however, that to institute any system of control it
                            would be necessary to base it upon an international convention. There
                            appeared to be many difficulties in the way of framing such a
                            convention, among them the traffic in arms which at that time was not
                            regulated effectively. The Temporary Mixed Commission finally came to
                            the conclusion that should the traffic in arms and munitions be
                            subjected to a sufficient measure of supervision the continuation of
                            private manufacture would be of little danger.</p>
                        <p>The efforts of the League were for that reason directed primarily to the
                            formulation of an arms traffic convention rather than to the control of
                            the private manufacture of arms.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, a considerable number of states members of the League
                            consistently expressed the view that an arms traffic convention could
                            never be fully effective unless it were accompanied by a convention
                            supervising and controlling the private manufacture of arms. This view
                            has not been shared by the United States which, while anxious to
                            cooperate with all efforts which appeared calculated really to lead to
                            the reduction or limitation of armament or to remove causes of
                            international discord, did not for many reasons favor the elaborate and
                            often impractical proposals that have been made looking to the control
                            or supervision of the private manufacture of arms. As you are aware, the
                            Arms Traffic Convention signed at Geneva, June 17, 1925,<note n="61"
                                xml:id="d196fn61"><ref target="frus1925v01#pg_61"><hi rend="italic"

                            requisite number of ratifications and has not therefore come into
                            effect. Certain countries which favored the simultaneous treatment of
                            the problem of private manufacture with the problem of arms traffic have
                            now advanced the belief that the arms traffic convention will prove
                            ineffective if not totally useless unless a further convention regarding
                            the private manufacture of arms is concluded. It is in response to this
                            appeal that the Special Commission upon which you are to represent this
                            Government has been created. In order that you may have clearly in mind
                            the policy of this Government in regard to international agreements
                            regarding the private manufacture of arms and munitions and may be in a
                            position to explain and carry out that policy at the forthcoming

                        <p>During the course of the meetings of the Temporary Mixed Commission
                            certain foreign members thereof persisted in bringing into the
                            discussion the question of private manufacture. The American
                            representative did not enter into such discussions at any time.</p>
                        <p>During the arms traffic conference, when the question of private
                            manufacture was again raised—although it was not on the agenda of the
                            conference—the Honorable Theodore E. Burton, Chairman of the American
                            Delegation, made certain statements in regard thereto. These statements
                            taken together set forth the policy of this Government in regard to a
                            practical manner of dealing with this problem and indicate the limit to
                            which this Government would be prepared to go in an international
                            convention. The statements are quoted below for your information as they
                            appear in League of Nations Publication A.13.1925 IX “Proceedings of the
                            Conference for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and

                                <p>“This pending discussion on the subject of the manufacture of
                                    arms, and upon the subject of publicity for manufacture by
                                    producing States, is one of the greatest interest to the
                                    delegation from the United States.</p>
                                <p>“Some weeks ago I stated that it was the custom in our own
                                    country to publish statistics of manufacture. That is still our
                                    custom, and will be for years to come, and, in view of that
                                    fact, we should be willing to join in a Convention providing for
                                    publicity for producing states as well as for non-producing
                                    states. Having made that statement, I was of the opinion that it
                                    was for other delegates from other countries to follow it up by
                                    a concrete proposal if they so desired.</p>
                                <p>“I am aware of the objections that have been raised against doing
                                    anything in that way. It has been said that the present
                                    Conference was called merely to deal with the control of the
                                    trade in arms, of which the main feature is publicity. Let me
                                    call your attention, however, to the fact that if we adopt a
                                    liberal construction, control of statistics relating to
                                    producing countries is within the scope of this Convention. The
                                    objection has been raised by the non-producing <pb n="220"
                                        xml:id="pg_220" facs="0306"/>countries that any agreement
                                    would be ineffective if it applied to them only or applied
                                    particularly to them, and that, in order to secure their rights,
                                    statistical information must also be given as to production.</p>
                                <p>“It seems to me that we are authorized to give a liberal
                                    construction to the work which this Conference was called upon
                                    to do. We are not to be bound by any hard and fast rules. If,
                                    when the representatives of forty nations come together, a
                                    proposal or subject suggests itself, which is closely associated
                                    with the main question before the Conference, it is for us to
                                    act upon it, at least by adopting a resolution stating the sense
                                    of the Conference. I trust, Mr. President, that not merely in
                                    order to protect the non-producing states, but in order to
                                    secure an ampler result and to make a more progressive step,
                                    something will be done in this Conference in this direction.”

                                <p>“… The point of view of the United States is already on record in
                                    some remarks made here yesterday week, and I welcome the
                                    proposal introduced by the Roumanian delegate in regard to
                                    publicity in the manufacture of arms. The only question that I
                                    ask is whether it goes far enough. I could not, however, favour
                                    postponement of the operation of this Convention until another
                                    is adopted. Postponement of good intentions until some other
                                    gathering may meet, or some other Convention be concluded, has
                                    been the graveyard of some of the best aspirations of the human
                                    race.</p>
                                <p>“We are here for a purpose. The Temporary Mixed Commission
                                    considered the question of joining up with our agenda a proposal
                                    regarding the private manufacture of arms. The Assembly approved
                                    the conclusion of that Mixed Commission that it was preferable
                                    to keep the two matters separate. It was with that understanding
                                    that the delegates came from the United States—that we were to
                                    do something here of which the central fact should be publicity.
                                    And now I must run counter to an opinion which is prevalent
                                    among lovers of peace in regard to the prohibition of the
                                    private manufacture of arms.</p>
                                <p>“Many of those in Europe and America with whom I have cooperated
                                    for years past in movements for peace think that the solution of
                                    their problems rests in the prohibition of private manufacture.
                                    They argue, that so long as private manufacture continues, there
                                    will be a powerful industrial interest, the prosperity of which
                                    will be promoted by war, and this they consider to be a barrier
                                    in the way of peace. They consider also that these private
                                    manufacturers have also been extremely skilful in the
                                    circulation of propaganda unfavorable to peace. Thus, they say,
                                    the manufacture of arms, munitions and implements of war should
                                    be restricted to Governments.</p>
                                <p>“Let me point out to you the fallacy of this argument. The
                                    private manufacture of arms and munitions is flexible and
                                    adapted both to peace and to war. It may consist of the
                                    manufacture of explosives and material for industrial purposes,
                                    of sporting arms which have nothing to do with war, to which can
                                    be added in time of conflict the manufacture of military arms.
                                    Take my own country as an example; the manufacture of munitions
                                    and military arms was negligible before the late Great War, but,
                                    during that period, private industry increased to enormous
                                    proportions; it has now fallen back to what it was before.</p>
                                <p>“Government manufacture and control, on the other hand, are
                                    inflexible and look to a state of war. It involves the
                                    maintenance of <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0307"/>a very
                                    considerable force, always engaged in the manufacture of
                                    implements of destruction. If that force is disbanded the nation
                                    is helpless, and there is always a strong interest in favour of
                                    maintaining in any form of Government activity a large force,
                                    expanding its operations to the maximum. Thus, I say that, at
                                    least in a country like the United States, the idea that the
                                    private manufacture of arms should be prohibited, and that such
                                    prohibition would promote peace, is a chimera. More than that,
                                    why should a Conference be called for the prohibition of private
                                    manufacture and leave the Governmental or public manufacture
                                    alone? Shall the respective Governments of the world, whether
                                    warlike or peaceful in their intentions, build huge structures
                                    to make arms, and at the same time prohibit the private
                                    manufacture? What of the private manufacturers, many of whom
                                    have the most pacific intentions? What have they done that there
                                    should be this discrimination against them? What hope have the
                                    lovers of peace in prohibiting private manufacture if
                                    Governmental manufacture may still go on to an enormous and
                                    unlimited extent? …” Page 251.</p>

                            Government not to go beyond the collection and publication of statistics
                            is clearly indicated. You should take an early opportunity to reiterate

                            you to allow yourself to be drawn into any detailed discussion of the
                            various unacceptable provisions of the Draft Convention.</p>

                            statistics, is questioned or in any way attacked, the Department
                            believes that you should confine your reply first to an allusion to this
                            Government’s reply to the League’s invitation and second to a statement
                            to the following general effect:</p>
                        <p>The Arms Traffic Convention has not yet been ratified and has not come
                            into effect. The proposed draft convention for private manufacture
                            presents an involved and complicated agreement, the provisions of which
                            would be difficult if not impossible to administer and the necessity for
                            which is not clear to the United States Government. The American
                            Government believes that an adequate system of publicity as to
                            production for both private and government factories will furnish
                            valuable information to the governments signatories to the treaty. Such
                            an agreement, in addition to the Arms Traffic Convention, will provide
                            effective machinery for making known to the world any abuses either by
                            individuals or governments in connection with the manufacture of or
                            traffic in arms. If, when such agreements have been in operation, it is
                            shown by experience that further and even stricter international
                            agreements are necessary, it will then be appropriate to discuss what
                            further measures are possible.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the following remarks made by Lord Cecil at the 8th
                            meeting of the First Sub Commission of the Temporary Mixed Commission at

                                    would therefore be much better able to form a judgment after the
                                    coming into force of the said convention and that the question

                            point out that such a provision would appear to be absolutely essential
                            to make an international agreement for publicity useful since the
                            contingency might arise wherein a government which followed the policy
                            of manufacturing all of its military equipment in government arsenals
                            might engage in practices very similar to those which are imputed to
                            private manufacturers and condemned. A memorandum pointing out the
                            distinction between the position of the United States Government and of
                            certain other governments in regard to methods of supplying needs for
                            military equipment is transmitted herewith as an annex to this
                            instruction.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, not join in any report which the Special Commission
                            may make to the Council of the League of Nations. In this connection,
                            you may advise the Commission that you will make your report to your
                            government.</p>
                        <p>You should make it abundantly clear during the meeting that should the
                            other nations represented on the Commission wish to recommend the
                            formulation of a convention of a more elaborate nature this government
                            would, of course, offer no objection, although it would naturally
                            reserve its right to abstain from adherence to such a convention or to
                            adhere to it with reservations in keeping with its announced and well
                            known policy in the premises.</p>
                        <p>There is transmitted herewith, as an annex to this instruction, a
                            memorandum covering in general the statistics of production of arms in
                            the United States in recent years.<note n="65" xml:id="d196fn65">Not
                                printed.</note> By reference to this you will observe that the
                            United States has taken a very minor part in this type of business. You
                            should emphasize these data in case an attempt is made to place upon the
                            United States the onus for prospective failure of the Commission’s work
                            or any statements are made to the effect that a convention regarding
                            arms manufacture could not be effective without American
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>The above-mentioned memorandum further contains certain suggestions as to
                            the statistical material that will be most readily and economically
                            obtainable and also suggestions as to the frequency of collection and
                            publication which should be provided for in any convention.</p>

                                be considered to mean manufacture taking place in establishments of
                                which the State is not the sole proprietor.</p>
                            <p>This Article should be eliminated, since any convention to which the
                                United States would desire to become a party would necessarily cover
                                both governmental and private manufacture.</p>
                            <p rend="center">Article 3</p>
                            <p>The High Contracting Parties undertake not to permit in the territory
                                under their jurisdiction the private manufacture of the articles
                                included in Categories I, II, III and IV and paragraph 1 of Category
                                V without the written authorization of the Government.</p>
                            <p>This authorization shall be given in the form of a licence, which
                                shall be valid for a period to be determined individually by each
                                High Contracting Party and which shall be renewable for a further

                            <p>This Article is not acceptable from the point of view of the United
                                States. The constitutional possibility of establishing a licensing
                                system for manufacturers of arms and ammunition is to say the least
                                extremely doubtful. As has been pointed out in the body of the
                                instructions it would probably be possible to require manufacturers
                                to obtain Federal licenses to manufacture arms in the District of
                                Columbia and in the Territories, and also to obtain licenses for
                                inter-State or foreign commerce in arms and ammunition. The
                                possibility of obtaining legislation of this character, however,
                                seems so remote that it is not desirable for the American
                                representative even to discuss the possibilities in this regard
                                during the course of the coming meeting.</p>
                            <p rend="center">Article 4</p>
                            <p>The High Contracting Parties undertake not to grant a licence for the
                                manufacture of the material referred to in Article 3 and to withdraw
                                such licence if it has been granted to any firm which is in a
                                position to influence a newspaper either because it holds a
                                sufficient portion of its capital or because it conducts the
                                management or any other part of its work, or because its directors,
                                managers or high officials are in a position to exercise such
                                influence.</p>

                                and III or who has advertised war material covered by Categories IV

                                concerning the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and
                                Ammunition and in Implements of War.</p>
                            <p>This Article is obviously unacceptable for the reason stated under
                                the comments on Article 3. Further, the administration of the
                                provisions contained in this Article or of other provisions directed
                                substantially to the same end would appear to be almost impossible
                                from a practical point of view. The most elaborate investigational
                                machinery would be necessary to ascertain the connection of munition
                                manufacturers with the press and it is not believed that an attempt
                                in this direction would serve any practical or useful purpose.</p>
                            <p>The second paragraph of Article 4 seems likewise impossible to
                                administer effectively.</p>
                            <p rend="center">Article 5</p>
                            <p>Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to conclude any

                            <p>The provisions of this Article, while plausible on first sight, would
                                not be acceptable. The war materials included in the Categories of
                                the Arms Traffic Convention are manufactured in many types of
                                industrial plants, some of which could not be termed strictly
                                munitions factories. To endeavor to eliminate from consideration all
                                manufacturing establishments capable of producing any of the
                                articles included in the Categories, in which members of the Senate
                                or the House of Representatives are directors or managers would be
                                both unwise and impracticable.</p>

                                the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0314"/>material for which the

                            <p>The United States Government is in favor of a system of publicity for
                                manufactures of arms and ammunition. It would appear, however, that
                                a more appropriate system of publicity is provided for in Article 7
                                as noted below, than in Article 6. Eliminating the idea of licenses
                                from Article 6, there remain merely the provisions that the names,
                                styles and addresses of the proprietor or proprietors, partners,
                                managers or directors of munition plants, be published, and that the
                                existence of all munitions contracts be made known along with an
                                annual report of the business of each munitions manufacturer.</p>
                            <p>It is not perceived how the publication of this information would be
                                of great value to anyone save the competitors of the manufacturers
                                in question. In so far as the trade of individual plants with
                                foreign countries is concerned the Arms Traffic Convention provides
                                adequate publicity.</p>

                                    no useful military purpose and in consequence such items might
                                    well be omitted, the danger involved in tampering with the

                                    amend these categories should be opposed on the grounds

                                <item>As to the type of statistics to be provided for in the
                                    proposed Convention on the Manufacture of Arms, it is believed
                                    that the statistics required should be, in general, in a form
                                    corresponding to the type adopted in the Annex to the Arms
                                    Traffic Convention. Such statistics should, in general, be
                                    limited to totals and any effort to include the names of firms,
                                    either as producers or as purchasers, should be opposed as
                                    involving a danger of unfair competition and further as being an
                                    unwarranted interference with the industry concerned.</item>

                                <item>As regard the periods of time to be covered by the statistics
                                    in question, it is believed that publication at one year
                                    intervals is sufficient to serve the purpose of the proposed
                                    Convention. While an effort may be made to provide for
                                    publication of statistics in conformity with the provisions of
                                    the Arms Traffic Convention in regard to export, that is,
                                    publications within two months of the end of each quarter, it is
                                    believed that any publication at intervals of less than six
                                    months might involve so much labor and expense as to be
                                    prohibitive.</item>

                                <item>On the other hand, the Bureau of the Census is undoubtedly in
                                    a position to collect and publish statistics with as great
                                    efficiency as the statistical office of any other government.
                                    Therefore, while too frequent collection of statistics should be
                                    opposed as unnecessary and uneconomical, argument [<hi

                                    unanimous insistence on quarterly publication by the other

                                <item>Every effort should be made to restrict the required
                                    statistics to those of the production of combined articles. An
                                    effort to collect statistics of the production of component
                                    parts of many of the articles listed in the categories of the
                                    Arms Traffic Convention would entail an excessive amount of
                                    labor. If the inclusion of component parts is insisted upon, an
                                    effort should be made to enumerate such parts, and to include in
                                    this enumeration only the most important parts, essential to the
                                    use of the completed article for military purposes. For example,
                                    regarding fire control equipment, it might with justice be
                                    pointed out that statistics of the production of lenses suitable
                                    therefor might be sufficient, without requiring statistics of
                                    the other component parts.</item>

                                <item>The position of the United States in regard to dependence upon
                                    private manufacture for the supply of its wartime needs in arms,
                                    ammunition, and implements of war is different from that of any
                                    other great Power. The United States is the only great nation
                                    which does not <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0319"/>maintain
                                    Government arsenals in time of peace for the supply of its
                                    wartime needs in arms, ammunition and implements of war. While
                                    the United States maintains six so-called arsenals, these plants
                                    are in reality little more than experimental laboratories. Under
                                    the most favorable conditions they can be expanded to an extent
                                    which will furnish only a small percentage of our wartime
                                    requirements in arms, ammunition, and implements of war. During
                                    the World War, Government arsenals as such furnished less than
                                    9% of our munitions requirements. Over 91% of our munitions
                                    requirements were furnished by private manufacturers, either on
                                    a lowest bidder or cost plus basis.</item>

                                    quasi-Government plants such as Krupp, Creusot, Armstrong,

                                    peacetime existence in the main to peacetime trade which for
                                    various reasons is comparatively small. It takes immeasurably
                                    longer to create a new industry in time of war than to expand an
                                    industry already in existence. This time element is influenced
                                    not so much by the time required to construct the plant as by
                                    the time necessary to procure and train the skilled personnel
                                    required in the highly technical operations of munitions

                                    would cripple the United States by affecting more than 90% of
                                    its source of supply. Such measures would affect other great

                                    arms, ammunition, and implements of war under the War Department
                                    General Mobilization Plan would require an initial expenditure
                                    in excess of two billion dollars. The creation and maintenance
                                    of a war reserve of munitions capable of supplying our
                                    requirements under the War Department General Mobilization Plan
                                    from the beginning of an emergency until the time when
                                    production would meet probable war consumption, computed on a
                                    basis of expenditure such as existed in the World War, would
                                    involve the initial expenditure of a sum in excess of five
                                    billion dollars. This amount does not include the initial cost
                                    of production plants nor does it include costs incidental to
                                    storage. It should be noted that on a basis of a 5% annual
                                    turnover for depreciation and obsolescence, the maintenance of
                                    such a reserve would involve an annual expenditure of two

                                    position to enter upon a scheme which would involve such
                                    colossal appropriations and expenditure, it seems obvious that
                                    the only solution in so far as our own country is concerned is
                                    to reject any steps which may tend to limit consideration to the

                        <p>177. Commission on Private Manufacture met last evening. Bernstorff
                                chairman.<note n="66" xml:id="d197fn66">Count Johann Heinrich von
                                Bernstorff, German delegate.</note> In the course of general
                            discussion I made short statement of our views including necessity for
                            publicity for both private and government manufacture. Italian delegate
                            objected on the ground that his instructions did not permit him and the
                            Commission was not competent to deal with government manufacture and was
                            supported by legalistic arguments advanced by several other delegates.
                                <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0321"/>Belgian delegate, who
                            warmly upheld my contention that both categories should be dealt with,
                            suggested that inasmuch as certain phases of question would probably be
                            considered by the Preparatory Commission and the final Disarmament
                            Conference it might be well to make haste slowly with a view to seeing
                            whether both categories could be dealt with either together or
                            separately. I then stated that any agreement in order to be acceptable
                            to us must provide publicity for both private and government manufacture
                            and that if it was decided that the Commission could deal only with the
                            one category I should be embarrassed in continuing. Japanese delegate
                            said that his instructions definitely precluded him from discussing
                            government manufacture but he expressed readiness to agree to delay in
                            the hope of finding a solution. It was finally agreed that the chairman
                            appoint subcommittee on which we are to be represented and that each
                            delegation is to submit to this subcommittee its full views in order
                            that they may be examined and an attempt made to reconcile them. It is
                            not anticipated that there will be any future meetings the Private
                            Manufacture Commission for the present.</p>

                        <p>248. My 177, March 15, 10 a.m. Drafting committee met Tuesday afternoon.
                            I had previously informed the chairman, Bernstorff, that as long as the
                            committee was not prepared to consider a draft agreement providing
                            publicity for government as well as private manufacture it was difficult
                            for me to participate. As he made it clear that this condition could not
                            be met, I did not attend meeting and confined myself to forwarding a
                            memorandum to chairman commenting on secret [<hi rend="italic"
                                >secrecy?</hi>] provisions of the draft agreement and emphasizing
                            that any more detailed discussion thereof would be useful only if the
                            essential principle of publicity for government manufacture were to be
                                accepted.<note n="67" xml:id="d198fn67">See League of Nations, <hi

                            invitation specifies that each country is to appoint not more than five
                            members, who may be accompanied by experts who will have the right to
                            attend the proceedings of the Conference, but without the right to speak
                            or vote, except by special permission. It likewise specifies that the

                        <p>11. On February 5 President sent a message to Congress recommending that
                            appropriation of $15,000 be authorized to cover expenses of American
                            participation in appointment of members of Economic Conference. He

                                    American point of view may be duly presented and in the hope of
                                    contributing to the development of sound economic foundations of
                                    friendly intercourse and prosperity. The United States is taking
                                    its part in study of the problem of arms limitation at the
                                    invitation of the League of Nations. This country should also

                                    American interests. This Government will have the benefit of its

                        <p>On yesterday I had an opportunity to enter into conversation with
                            Congressman Cordell Hull of Tennessee and took occasion to remind him of
                            the fact that Dr. Thomas Walker Page, of the Institute of Economics, a
                            member of the Preparatory Commission of the International Economic
                            Conference, had telephoned to him in regard to this subject shortly
                            after returning from Geneva, after attending the second session of the
                            Preparatory Commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hull expressed considerable interest in the subject, noting his
                            pleasure in the fact that the President had sent a message to Congress
                            asking for an appropriation with which to defray the expenses of
                            American participation in the appointment of members of the Conference.
                            When questioned as to what he considered to be the appropriate line of
                            action for such a Conference to take, Mr. Hull confined his remarks
                            almost entirely to the question of tariff barriers. He spoke at some
                            length in regard to the desirability of a general reduction of import
                            duties and appeared to feel that the tariff of the United States is the
                            key to the entire world situation. When I suggested that perhaps
                            concrete results from this Conference could scarcely go beyond the
                            subject of equality of treatment in commercial matters, he expressed
                            heartily his interest on this ground. He referred to speeches which he
                            had made on the subject in 1916 and on subsequent occasions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hull expressed the opinion that the only danger connected with the
                            desired appropriation would lie in the possible objection of some
                            individual or individuals to its passage, with consequent delay and <pb
                                n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0326"/>possible failure because of the
                            end of the session. He expressed the opinion that whatever Mr. Madden’s
                            Committee recommended would be adopted by the House.</p>
                        <p>Speaking in regard to an entirely different subject, Mr. Hull expressed
                            the opinion that the action of the Democrats in defeating the Lausanne
                                Treaty<note n="83" xml:id="d202fn83">See vol. <ref

                            would not result in getting a better treaty for the United States with
                            Turkey.</p>

                            <p>The dislocation following the war resulted in instability in
                                currencies, interruption of the usual flow of international credits,
                                reduced production and difficulties of transport across frontiers;
                                it was accompanied by unemployment and impaired purchasing power,
                                with the further result that agriculture suffered from a loss of
                                markets and lack of credits. These adversely affected the standards
                                of living.</p>
                            <p>The several States, on the theory of protecting individual interests,
                                undertook various devices of relief that in the majority of
                                instances further retarded the natural flow of credits and
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>The first concerted attack on this multiple problem was made at the
                                Brussels Conference in September–October, 1920.<note n="84"

                                which resulted the treaties which have tended materially to clarify
                                the political situations in Europe.</p>
                            <p>It may be assumed to have been in the minds of international
                                political and economic leaders in every country that the need
                                existed of concerted discussion of various factors still
                                contributing to the unstable conditions in Europe. The League of
                                Nations called this International Economic Conference to discuss and
                                advise upon some of the remaining questions.</p>
                            <p>From the date of the Brussels Conference to the date of this Economic
                                Conference, continuous improvement has been in evidence throughout
                                Europe in practically all social and economic conditions, naturally
                                more marked in some countries than in others.</p>
                            <p>The Agenda recommended by the Preparatory Committee, and the
                                documentation prepared at its request, has portrayed a condition of
                                distress in Europe which in the view of the Delegation of the United
                                States did not at the time of the Conference obtain in all lines of
                                endeavour. The Agenda was based upon the commercial interdependence
                                between nations, more particularly on the interdependence existing
                                between the different countries in Europe. The facts developed and
                                discussions had at the Conference emphasized not only the necessary
                                interdependence of all the countries of the world, but the
                                interdependence of the several social groups as well.</p>
                            <p>Within the limits fixed by the Agenda, in the main, discussion and
                                the resultant recommendations revolved around European problems,
                                though the general resolutions, for the most part, have world-wide
                                application. No discussions were had on governmental debts,
                                reparation or movements of population.</p>
                            <p>The Conference, looking forward rather than backward, confined its
                                attention to tangible problems, viewing nothing as static, with full
                                recognition that the weights of the various factors would change
                                from time to time. Fundamental policies of national economy, such as
                                free trade versus protection and nationalization of resources, were
                                not included in the deliberations of the Conference. Recognizing the
                                definite progress, almost to completion, of the stabilization of
                                currencies on a gold basis, and that tariff levels were less
                                important relatively than the rationalization of tariffs and also
                                that nationalization of resources was more a domestic than an
                                international question, the transactions of the Conference did not
                                include a discussion on these subjects except incidentally.</p>
                            <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0328"/>
                            <p>The Members of the Delegation were greatly impressed with the men who
                                were gathered at this Conference, brought together from every
                                quarter to give their experience and information and contributing on
                                every phase of economic life. Very helpful had been the work of the
                                Preparatory Committee and the Economic Section of the League. This
                                gave direction to the discussions and considerations; and with this
                                start, the Conference, with its Advisors, supplemented and
                                elaborated in a large degree the preparatory work and material.</p>
                            <p>The Permanent Secretariat of the League had made careful and well
                                organized arrangements and the mechanism provided for carrying on
                                the work of the Conference was admirable and effective.</p>
                            <p>The Members of the American Delegation were accorded full right and
                                participation in the work of the Conference. The names of the
                                Delegation of the United States, their several responsibilities in,
                                and respective official connections with, the Conference, are set
                                forth in Annex I. The Experts and Advisers of the Delegation of the
                                United States had participation in the discussions and in the
                                preparation of materials for the use of the Conference. The names of
                                the Experts and Advisers who assisted at the Conference and of the
                                Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries of the Delegation are set
                                forth in Annex I.</p>
                            <p>The Conference developed the value of personal contacts with members
                                of the several Delegations and also with the experts and advisers
                                accompanying them. There were 194 Delegates and a larger number of
                                Experts and Advisers, representing 48 countries. As a result of
                                personal discussions, notable progress in clarification and
                                standardization of the use of technical terms was achieved. Through
                                personal discussions it became possible for the Delegates from
                                different countries to weigh and value points of view of other
                                countries. Furthermore, through personal discussion it became
                                possible for Delegates to better differentiate between economic and
                                political phases of questions.</p>
                            <p>It might be fair to say that the indirect discussions of the
                                Conference may be of quite as lasting and general benefit as the
                                resolutions passed. Many divergencies of opinion existed between
                                Delegations and with Delegations; but in spite of these
                                divergencies, there were evolved definite formulae for the relief of
                                economic difficulties that still militate against international
                                commerce.</p>
                            <p>At the opening of the Conference our Delegation was asked to give a
                                statement on the character and probable causes leading up to the
                                relatively prosperous position of the United States. Europe, which
                                possesses rich and varied natural resources, has an area
                                approximately that of the United States. The individual States of
                                our country are geographically and physically as heterogeneous as
                                the different States in Europe; but in trade and industry, we are a
                                homogeneous whole, without barriers or currency differences. Europe,
                                on the other hand <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0329"/>has a
                                series of separate units, each contending for national economic
                                independence. Both employers and workers have in the main adopted
                                the policy of unrestricted output; and generally workers have
                                accepted substitution of machines for hand labor, and employers in
                                turn have compensated the workers with appropriate increases in
                                wages. The conditions obtaining in our country have been important
                                factors in the creation and maintenance of higher wage levels,
                                resulting in higher standards of living and, in turn, in greater
                                power of consumption and production. A comparison between the
                                situation in the United States and the European countries has led
                                certain economists to advocate an economic United States of
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>It developed in the Conference that “consumers’ goods” were being
                                used, even in Europe, at as high a rate per capita as prior to the
                                war; but the production and consumption of “capital goods” was
                                considerably lower and that this, in the main, accounts for
                                unemployment and, in turn, had reduced wages and purchasing power to
                                a lower level.</p>
                            <p>The discussion of the Conference further disclosed the fact that if
                                the development of unused or inadequately developed resources
                                throughout the world could be initiated and financed, increased
                                consumption of capital goods would follow, with the result of
                                reduction or elimination of unemployment, and the probable increase
                                in the wage level and consumption of consumable goods.</p>
                            <p>The Conference divided itself into three committees on Commerce,
                                Industry and Agriculture. Each of these divided itself into
                                subcommittees for specialized discussion. In the Committee on
                                Commerce the discussion revolved largely about trade barriers. A
                                limited discussion on tariff levels disclosed the age old
                                differences of opinion, but at the same time brought out the fact
                                that even more important than relative differences in levels of
                                custom duties was their freqeunt and abrupt alteration. Lack of
                                continuity of policies, differences in the standards of
                                classification, discrimination and other unequal treatments are more
                                injurious than differences in tariff levels. No recommendation was
                                made in respect of tariff levels but the support of all the members
                                was secured approving the principle of “equality of treatment” and
                                the “unconditional most-favored-nation” clause as well as an accord
                                condemning the policy of artificial limitation of raw material
                                exports. The resolutions will also disclose that existing trade
                                barriers would be less harmful if general adoption could be obtained
                                of improvements in practice resulting in simplification of customs
                                formalities, standardization of tariff nomenclature and
                                consolidation of customs charges and other technical
                                improvements.</p>
                            <p>On rationalization in industry there was a full discussion; the
                                principal differences grew out of the fact that the European workers
                                regarded rationalization as likely to bring about increased
                                unemployment. <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0330"/>However,
                                finally agreement was had on a formula based on experience of the
                                countries in which rationalization had been most highly developed.
                                The conference went on record in opposition to indirect and direct
                                states subsidies, but without undertaking critical definitions of
                                the terms, urging that subsidies should not be likely [<hi
                                    rend="italic">lightly?</hi>] invoked.</p>
                            <p>In the discussions on Cartels, appeared also differences between
                                workers and operators. In addition to this, the subject was
                                relatively new and untried, so no accurate definition was
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>We recognize that there are certain physical and geographical
                                conditions in particular situations that might make it desirable and
                                economical for some form of international industrial agreements to
                                be made; but we are apprehensive of the dangers of restricted output
                                and the tendency to monopolistic exploitation. The resolution on
                                Cartels sets out most of the objections and points out that the
                                success of Cartels will be conditional on the character and policies
                                of the Management.</p>
                            <p>Early experience in the United States in agreements of a similar
                                character resulted in restrictive legislation. Because of this and
                                the conviction that governments would participate in Cartels, our
                                Delegation felt that we could not by our actions approve
                                international Cartels and we took a definite position against
                                international Cartels with Governmental participation.</p>
                            <p>The Committee on Agriculture adopted resolutions in support of
                                international extension of co-operative marketing, in favor of
                                enlargement of agricultural credits in countries where these are
                                still inadequate and urging the world-wide collection of comparable
                                statistics on production, movement, stocks and consumption of farm
                                products.</p>

                            <p>In conclusion we have appreciatively to acknowledge the contributions
                                of the various departments of the Government in Washington. Before
                                the departure for the Conference, sub-committees were set up to
                                explore the questions set forth in the Agenda on which were experts
                                from the following Departments of the Government, State, Treasury,
                                Commerce, Agriculture, Labor and the United States Tariff
                                Commission. These sub-committees held many meetings before the
                                delegation convened in Washington. Before leaving Washington, the
                                members of the Delegation had two meetings with the expert members
                                of the sub-committees. In the eight days crossing the ocean the
                                Members of the Delegation and the experts accompanying the <pb
                                    n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0331"/>Delegation held fourteen
                                meetings for the discussion of the documentation of the Preparatory
                                Committee and all the facts and statistics developed by the
                                sub-committees of experts relating to the economic position of the
                                world and particularly with reference to the United States. During
                                the course of the Conference, daily meetings were held, including
                                Delegates and Experts and Advisors, at which the policies of the day
                                were outlined.</p>
                            <p>We feel that within the limits fixed for discussion and
                                recommendation, the conference has pointed ways for the removal or
                                modification of obstacles to the natural flow of international
                                trade, and for the lowering of costs of production. We believe if
                                the formula evolved should be followed, it will be beneficial to the
                                peoples not only of Europe but of the world. We are convinced that
                                improvement in economic condition in Europe will make for universal
                                peace.</p>

                                    invite the Government of the United States of America to attend
                                    an international conference with a view to framing an

                                    and to participate in this Conference, which, it is informed
                                    will convene at Geneva on October 17, 1927. The President has

                                    attend the Conference as the representative of the United

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The President has instructed me to inform
                            you of his desire that you should represent this Government at the
                            forthcoming conference on import and export prohibitions and
                            restrictions to be held at Geneva beginning October 17, 1927, to
                            consider the adoption of an agreement for the abolition of such
                            prohibitions and restrictions. You will be assisted by H. Lawrence
                            Groves, Commercial Attaché at Vienna; Charles E. Lyon, Commercial
                            Attaché at Berne; Henry F. Worley, of the Treasury Department; and Percy
                            W. Bidwell, one of the European representatives of the Tariff
                            Commission. Mr. S. P. Tuck, American Consul at Geneva, will serve as
                            secretary of the delegation.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires you to be governed by the following instructions
                            as representative of the United States at the forthcoming Conference on
                            Import and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions, which convenes at
                            Geneva October 17, 1927.</p>
                        <p>The subject matter of the Conference is the preliminary draft agreement
                            prepared by the Economic Committee of the League. The following comments
                            are made in relation thereto.</p>
                        <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0341"/>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 1</hi></p>
                        <p>Having in mind that the object of the conference is to abolish the system
                            of prohibitions and restrictions, it appears that the undertaking in the
                            first paragraph to abolish “all import and export prohibitions and
                            restrictions” could probably not be construed as extending to import
                            duties imposed for the purposes of revenue or protection to domestic
                            producers. The Department, however, feels it essential to dispel any
                            possible doubt on that score. It is believed that most if not all the
                            other governments will share that view. The Department therefore desires
                            that an appropriate modification to that effect be embodied in the
                            agreement. If an appropriate amendment is proposed by one of the other
                            delegations you may support it. If not, you may suggest that the
                            following be included as a separate article: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as affecting the
                                    right of any contracting state to impose import duties; or to
                                    adopt measures to prevent or counteract dumping or to offset
                                    bounties or subsidies paid to foreign producers.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It would appear preferable that the proposal of such an amendment, if
                            found necessary, be made in the latter stages of the conference, in
                            order to avoid giving opportunity for the suggestion to be made that
                            import duties be brought within the scope of the conference.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 2</hi></p>
                        <p>No observations appear to be called for.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 3</hi></p>
                        <p>The provisions of Article 3 of the International Convention for the
                            Simplification of Customs Formalities of November 3, 1923, should be
                            incorporated in the Article rather than merely included by reference.
                            Since the United States is not a party to that Convention, it is the
                            more desirable that any agreement to be signed at the present Conference
                            be complete in itself.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that Article 3 of the Convention of November 3, 1923, is
                            quoted on page 21 of Document C.I.A.P.1,<note n="98" xml:id="d210fn98"
                                >See footnote 96, <ref target="#pg_249">p. 249</ref>.</note> which
                            contains the draft agreement under discussion at the present
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the introductory paragraph of Article 3 of the draft
                            Agreement should read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the case of any prohibitions or restrictions which may be
                                    applied within the limits set by the present Agreement, the
                                    contracting States shall in the matter of licenses comply
                                    strictly with the following provisions:”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>There should then be inserted paragraphs (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to
                                (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) inclusive of Article 3 of the Convention
                            of November 3, 1923. The Department <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256"
                                facs="0342"/>feels, however, in the light of its experience in
                            endeavoring to protect American trade with countries having a system of
                            licenses, that paragraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) of that Convention
                            needs to be revised and broadened in order to prevent possible abuses.
                            There is transmitted herewith for your information a copy of the draft
                            form of Article 7 which is being inserted in commercial treaties now
                            being negotiated by the United States.<note n="99" xml:id="d210fn99">Not

                            Article 7 deals with the issue of licenses.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that sub-paragraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) should
                            be revised, to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) That, in the event of the fixing of

                                    restricted goods authorized for importation or exportation, that
                                    may prevent according to each other contracting state an
                                    equitable share of such importation or exportation, having
                                    regard to the normal volume of trade of the respective countries
                                    in the particular class of goods in question. In the application
                                    of the provisions of this paragraph no distinction shall be made
                                    between, direct and indirect shipments.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It may be added for your information in connection with paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">e</hi>) of Article 3 of the convention of November 3,
                            1923, that the Department has considered the possible bearing of the
                            practice and requirements of the Federal Narcotics Board, which
                            allocates among American importers permits to import narcotics. The
                            Department understands that the reference in paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">e</hi>) to “equitable allocation”, refers to
                            allocation in respect of foreign sources of supply, and not to
                            allocation among domestic importers, since the latter is obviously an
                            internal question. In order to avoid any possible question, it is
                            important that the language adopted on this point be entirely clear.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 4</hi></p>
                        <p>With respect to the reference in the introductory sentence to the
                            possibility that prohibitions and restrictions may have a concealed
                            economic purpose, the Department calls attention to the circular
                            instruction recently issued on this subject, copy of which is
                            transmitted herewith.<note n="1" xml:id="d210fn1">See the Department’s

                            the matter of the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The United States has in force certain prohibitions or restrictions
                            coming within all the ten categories of suggested exceptions excepting
                            numbers 5, 8 and 10. The views of the Department concerning each, of the
                            proposed exceptions are as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0343"/>
                        <p>Point 1. The legislation of the United States in relation to helium gas,
                            copies of which are enclosed,<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Not printed;
                                see the act of Mar. 3, 1927, 44 Stat. (pt. 2) 1387.</note> comes
                            under this point, and the maintenance of this exception is necessary
                            from the standpoint of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Point 2. American prohibitions or restrictions on grounds of public
                            health relate, for example, to the importation of viruses or serums, or
                            of hay and straw not disinfected. The maintenance of this exception is
                            thus obviously necessary.</p>
                        <p>Point 3. American prohibitions or restrictions designed to protect animal
                            and plant life relate to foreign plants, fruits, seeds, bulbs, wild
                            animals, eggs, etc. as well as to the prohibition of importation of seal
                            skins from seals and otters taken in prohibited waters. The maintenance
                            of this exception is thus necessary.</p>
                        <p>Point 4. American prohibitions or restrictions imposed for moral or
                            humanitarian reasons or to suppress improper traffic relate <hi
                                rend="italic">inter alia</hi> to intoxicating liquors, smoking opium
                            and narcotic drugs, lottery tickets, obscene and immoral articles,
                            counterfeits, pictorial representations of prize fights and the plumage
                            of certain birds. The maintenance of this exception is therefore
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Point 5. The United States has no prohibitions or restrictions for
                            protection of “national treasures of artistic, historical or
                            archaeological value”, but has no objection to this exception.</p>
                        <p>Point 6. American prohibitions or restrictions to protect industrial,
                            literary and artistic property or unfair competition relate to
                            infringements of trade marks, trade names and copyrights, and also
                            include the requirements of the United States regarding marking of the
                            foreign origin of imported goods.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that the language of point 6 requires
                            modification in order to cover the necessary prohibitions or
                            restrictions enforced in the United States. In connection with this
                            matter, reference is made to Section 316 of the Tariff Act of 1922,
                            which relates to unfair competition.<note n="3" xml:id="d210fn3">42
                                Stat. 858, 943.</note> Reference is also made to the requirements of
                            American law that certain classes and kinds of imports be marked to show
                            the country of origin (see the customs regulations of the United States,
                            index under “Marking”; a copy of the Customs Regulations is among the
                            documents left at the American Consulate at Geneva by the American
                            delegation to the Economic Conference). It is of course impracticable
                            for the United States to require that domestic products for sale in the
                            United States be marked in the same manner as similar imported
                            products.</p>
                        <p>The Department therefore considers that point 6 should be amended to read
                            as follows: <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0344"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Prohibitions or restrictions intended, in conformity with
                                    national legislation or international conventions, to protect
                                    industrial, literary and artistic property, and to prevent
                                    unfair competition in regard to the false marking or appellation
                                    of origin, on condition that an analogous protection or
                                    supervision (except in the case of marking or appellation of
                                    origin) is applied to national products.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Point 7. American prohibitions or restrictions extending control
                            equivalent or analogous to that applied to domestic products apply, for
                            example, in the case of intoxicating liquors. This exception is thus
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Point 8. The United States has no prohibitions or restrictions such as
                            those enumerated under point 8, i. e. in relation to monopolies. It may
                            be observed that while State monopolies in foreign countries are
                            frequently felt to be detrimental to American interests, their
                            establishment is in the last analysis a matter of internal policy for
                            the country in question, and the Department accordingly feels that it is
                            not in a position to offer any objection to the proposed exception.</p>
                        <p>Point 9. While the Department has no objection to the exceptions embodied
                            in the draft of point 9, it considers that these exceptions should not
                            be limited to those made necessary pursuant to international conventions
                            relating to traffic in arms, opium, etc., or unfair methods of
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, reference is made to the Joint Resolution of Congress
                            approved January 31, 1922,<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">42 Stat.
                                361.</note> authorizing the President to prohibit or restrict the
                            exportation of arms or munitions of war to countries in which the United
                            States exercises extraterritorial jurisdition, or in which conditions of
                            domestic violence exist. A copy of this resolution is transmitted
                            herewith, together with copies of a ruling of the Department of State
                            dated May 3, 1927, concerning the kinds of articles requiring individual
                            export licenses when destined to Mexico.<note n="5" xml:id="d210fn5">Not

                        <p>The Department accordingly considers that Point 9 should be amended to
                            read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Prohibitions or restrictions established in pursuance of
                                    international conventions <hi rend="italic">or domestic
                                        legislation</hi> regulating traffic in arms, opium, or other
                                    forms of trade which give rise to dangers or abuses, or relating
                                    to methods of unfair competition.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Point 10. The United States has no prohibitions applicable to “coins,
                            gold, silver, currency notes or securities”. While the establishment of
                            prohibitions such as would appear possible under the exception set <pb
                                n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0345"/>forth in point 10 might be
                            subject to abuse, there are circumstances in which such prohibitions
                            appear necessary and accordingly this Department makes no objection to
                            that exception. The Department is not clear why exception 10 makes no
                            reference to “restrictions”. It appears also that a comma should follow
                            the word “currency”, in case, as it appears, that word is intended to
                            cover coins or circulating media other than gold and silver.</p>
                        <p>Additions to the exceptions listed in Article 4 are necessary to cover
                            the following points, in view of American legislation: (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) prohibition or restriction of importation of
                            prison-made goods; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) restrictions and
                            prohibitions pursuant to the so-called grain, cotton and tea standards
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to prison-made goods, the situation might be met in one of
                            two ways. The following statement might be included at the end of point
                            9: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(including the prohibition or restriction of importation of

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Alternatively, a separate exception having a distinct number might be
                            inserted, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>With respect to the grain, cotton and tea standards legislation, it is
                            suggested that an additional exception be inserted, as follows: <quote

                            Treasury may prohibit importation of specific shipments when the foreign
                            shipper thereof has refused to permit a duly accredited officer of the
                            United States to inspect his records pertaining to the market value or
                            classification of the goods in question. The Department prefers that you
                            should not raise this question until the general discussions on the
                            draft treaty have practically crystallized the treaty into final form
                            when you should ask specific instructions on this point.</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0346"/>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 5</hi></p>
                        <p>The Department considers that this article, in its present draft form is
                            far too broad and vague, and that if permitted to stand might
                            practically nullify the convention. If the article were maintained,
                            countries that have the system of prohibitions and restrictions might
                            feel free to contend that its continual existence is necessary “to
                            protect the vital economic and financial interests of the State.”
                            Heretofore, such measures have been defended as necessary to protect the
                            currency, or to develop industries regarded as “vital”. It is believed
                            that in general States considering it necessary to protect their
                            industries against foreign competition may do so with less disturbance
                            to international trade by employing protective duties than by the
                            arbitrary method of prohibitions or restrictions, which so greatly
                            interferes with commercial stability.</p>
                        <p>The Department suggests the following substitute for Article 5: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any
                                    contracting State to apply to importation or exportation all
                                    necessary measures in case of war or national calamity. The
                                    duration of any such measures shall be restricted to that of the
                                    causes or circumstances from which they arise”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Department attaches great importance to effecting the change set
                            forth above, and desires you strongly to oppose the original wording,
                            even though it appears likely that the State maintaining the licence
                            system will try to keep the original draft.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 6</hi></p>
                        <p>The Department considers that the provisions of this article are
                            necessary. It is doubtless intended to cover the application of
                            prohibitions or restrictions as penalty measures, as authorized or
                            contemplated in Section 317 of the Tariff Act of 1922<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d210fn9">42 Stat. 858, 944.</note> and in Section 26 of the
                            Shipping Act, 1916.<note n="10" xml:id="d210fn10">39 Stat

                        <p>It is, however, necessary to leave out the word “third”. Otherwise, it
                            appears that a State party to the Agreement which might impose “measures
                            of exclusion or discrimination” would be in a position to object to
                            prohibitions or restrictions which another State party to the Agreement
                            might adopt for the purpose of penalty or retaliation.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 7</hi></p>
                        <p>It is believed that the first paragraph of Article 7 would be clarified
                            if the words “provided they mutually agree to do so” are inserted in the
                            fourth line between “may” and “before.”</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0347"/>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the United States has not adhered to the Statute of the
                            Permanent Court of International Justice, it is essential that the
                            United States should not be obligated by the Agreement to submit to that
                            Court a dispute arising thereunder. At the same time, the United States
                            naturally does not wish to object to the adoption by the states adhering
                            to the Statute of such procedure for settlement of disputes among them
                            as they may consider appropriate. Nor does the Department desire you to
                            take a position that might be taken to indicate that it would not in any
                            circumstances submit a dispute to that Court.</p>
                        <p>The Department would greatly prefer to substitute for the entire Article
                            7 language based upon Article 35 of the Convention for the Supervision
                            of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunitions and in Implements of
                            War, concluded June 17, 1925,<note n="11" xml:id="d210fn11"><ref

                            If this proves impracticable, you should telegraph the Department for
                            further instructions, at the same time offering such suggestions as you
                            may deem appropriate.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 8</hi></p>
                        <p>The second paragraph of Article 8 is not clear. It provides that “such
                            State” may accede to the agreement. The reference is to the preceding
                            paragraph which provides for accession by States members of the League
                            of Nations or to which the Council shall have communicated a copy of the
                            agreement for purpose of signature.</p>
                        <p>It would thus appear that only such States as are members of the League
                            of Nations or are invited to sign the agreement may accede. Such a
                            provision is adequate only if all States are invited to sign. The
                            Department considers that the utility of an agreement on this general
                            subject would be the greater if all States should adhere thereto.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Article 9</hi></p>
                        <p>The Department does not at this time desire to give you instructions as
                            to the number of States whose ratification is requisite, but desires
                            your telegraphic comment on this point after you have had opportunity to
                            discuss the matter with your colleagues.</p>
                        <p>The Department has no objection to the wording proposed. It is presumed
                            that it will not be suggested that the United States be included as one
                            of the States whose ratification shall be requisite before the Agreement
                            becomes effective, since the United States does not enforce the
                            prohibitions or restrictions against which the Agreement is understood
                            to be directed.</p>

                        <p>The second paragraph of Article 10 refers to the “contracting States
                            named in the preceding article.” No States are named in the preceding
                            article, in which there is only a reference to countries named in the
                            appendix.</p>
                        <p>No time is fixed in the second paragraph of Article 10 within which the
                            Council must decide whether or not to summon a conference. Apparently
                            some clarification of drafting is requisite with respect to this
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>From the point of view of the countries not members of the League of
                            Nations, it seems preferable to omit this article, involving as it does,
                            an obligation to make a report to the Secretary General of the League.
                            Undoubtedly, Governments, regardless of League membership, would be glad
                            to respond to any inquiries which the Secretary General might make on
                            the subject.</p>

                        <p>The Department feels that this article might appropriately be redrafted
                            with a view to making the obligations thereof more definite and
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the question raised in the note at the bottom of page 18

                        <p>The Department is concerned lest the various countries attending the

                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0349"/>and export prohibitions and

                            threatened. You should particularly observe signs of such a tendency
                            during the opening days of the Conference and should keep the Department
                            fully informed. It seems possible that, in the event that the usefulness
                            of the proposed agreement is too seriously threatened, this Government
                            may withhold its signature, in which case the introduction of exceptions
                            by the United States might possibly be omitted entirely.</p>
                        <p>The Department has undertaken to reduce as far as possible the number of
                            exceptions which it must request in order to conform to the requirements
                            of American law. In introducing those brought forward in this
                            instruction you may appropriately avoid being among the first delegates
                            to propose exceptions not included in the draft as prepared. You may
                            also appropriately introduce them one by one at times when they will
                            create the smallest impression of piling up exceptions.</p>
                        <p>The Department calls particular attention to the recommendations of the
                            Economic Conference endorsing the draft convention as “a very
                            satisfactory basis” for the work of the forthcoming conference. The
                            Economic Conference, however, in addition recommended: <quote

                            reached for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and
                            restrictions. Such measures have caused material difficulty to American
                            commerce in the period since the war, by reason of the arbitrary and
                            discriminatory manner in which they have been applied. They have
                            interfered with that stability of conditions which is so essential <pb
                                n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0350"/>to the development and progress
                            of international commerce. Moreover, their application has led to a
                            number of diplomatic controversies and has complicated the negotiation
                            of the commercial treaties which the United States has desired to
                            conclude in order to establish its commercial relations with foreign
                            countries on a mutually satisfactory and permanent basis.</p>
                        <p>During the negotiations of the Conference you will of course keep the
                            Department closely advised of important developments, including the
                            substance of any new proposals that may be seriously considered. The
                            Department will endeavor promptly to instruct you in relation to such
                            points as may develop.</p>
                        <p>It may be that certain of the governments participating in the Conference
                            will be disposed to extend in some directions the scope of the matters
                            dealt with. As indicated above, the Department is of the opinion that in
                            view of the declarations of the Economic Conference in relation to
                            export duties, the scope of the Conference may be extended to deal with
                            them. But the Department is inclined to the view that in principle it
                            would not be advisable to extend the scope of the Conference in other
                            directions for example in relation to questions affecting import duties
                            and commercial treaties. Apart from the fact that certain inquiries
                            pertaining to these matters are being conducted by the League of Nations
                            pursuant to the conclusions of the Economic Conference, the Department
                            believes that no useful purpose will be served by the injection of such
                            controversial matters into the present Conference. The Conference is
                            more likely to succeed if its objectives are definitely limited.</p>
                        <p>Before signing an agreement you will of course report the full text to
                            the Department for consideration.</p>

                        <p>1. Department’s instruction No. 65, October 6, 1927. As presumably
                            proposal will be made that scope of draft agreement be expanded to
                            include topics mentioned in quotation from Economic Conference report,
                            you are instructed further as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. In view of the detriment the American public has suffered through
                            foreign export duties and other measures of a monopolistic nature, this
                            Government would in principle favor addition of new article, toward end
                            of Convention preferably, to be based on first <pb n="265"
                                xml:id="pg_265" facs="0351"/>paragraph of passage quoted from above
                            report; article might take following form:<note n="14" xml:id="d211fn14"
                                >Quoted passage not paraphrased.</note>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Each contracting State agrees to refrain from employing export
                                    duties, quotas, or other measures applicable to exportation of
                                    goods in such manner as to defeat the application of the
                                    principles laid down in the present agreement and particularly
                                    in article 1 thereof.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>If, as we hope, the Conference adopts modification of article 5 along
                            lines desired by the Department, then reference to “exceptional or
                            imperative circumstances” in first paragraph of quotation from report
                            would obviously not be necessary; refer to your instructions on article
                            5. Likewise, first sentence article 4 covers matter of health
                            regulations. The words “applicable to exportation of goods” are believed
                            to be necessary in order to rule out measures which are strictly
                            internal.</p>
                        <p>2. The so-called raw materials question involves question of export
                            duties. Complete information on the general subject will be found in
                            documents left at the consulate by the delegation to the Economic
                            Conference in relation to the limitation and monopolization of trade.
                            Export duties have been and are being imposed in order to restrict
                            exportation so as to bring about monopolistic prices; rubber control is
                            a case in point. Of course, monopolistic measures may take some form
                            besides export control, and then would be, naturally, quite beyond scope
                            of present discussions.</p>
                        <p>3. The Department does not wish to have the controversial question of raw
                            materials injected into the Conference if it would jeopard, as seems
                            possible, the primary purpose of the Conference instead of resulting in
                            a constructive step forward toward solution of raw materials problem.
                            Department does not desire you to introduce immediately any proposal,
                            but wishes you to observe carefully the tendencies in the Conference and
                            to cable us your advice as promptly as is practicable. You may wish to
                            sound out, discreetly, your French and Italian colleagues, as the French
                            and Italian delegates to the Economic Conference were especially
                            interested in subject of raw materials. Department will be glad to have
                            you cable comment in regard to text of any proposal on this subject
                            which has likelihood of being seriously pressed. You will then receive
                            additional instructions as may be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>4. Suggestion has been made (for example, the view expressed by the
                            British in correspondence with this Government on rubber
                                restriction)<note n="15" xml:id="d211fn15">See <ref

                                    358</ref> ff.</note> that export duties and import duties alike
                            operate as restrictions upon freedom of commerce. As it is possible that
                            suggestion <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0352"/>be made that
                            insertion of clause quoted above is not consistent with proposed
                            separate article on import duties discussed in Department’s instruction
                            No. 65, October 6, the Department calls attention to fact that, while
                            export and import duties may have restrictive or even prohibitive
                            effect, duties on exports may cut off supplies of particular
                            commodities, raw materials in particular, which may be of vital
                            necessity to foreign countries and which are not available elsewhere in
                            sufficient quantities for their needs, while on the other hand the
                            restriction of importation into a given market through duties on imports
                            is rarely, if indeed it is ever, a vital matter to the country of
                            origin, which still possesses alternative outlets. The material
                            differences which exist between effects of import and export duties, as
                            well as fact that latter appear to be much less firmly embedded in the
                            economy of countries than import duties are, are thought sufficient to
                            warrant their separate treatment.</p>
                        <p>5. It seems to Department that questions of free circulation of capital
                            and of artificial control of exchange operations are outside scope of
                            the present Conference. In Department’s view it is preferable that these
                            questions should not be made subject of seriously considered additional
                            provisions, but if proposals of this nature are pressed, you will cable
                            comment and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>6. Department of Commerce has approved these instructions.</p>

                        <p>1. First session, morning. In view of cordial reference to presence of
                            American delegation, I thanked the President (Colijn, Netherlands),
                            expressed interest of my Government in finding solution of difficulties,
                            and assured Conference of earnest cooperation of American delegation.
                            Acknowledgement was also made by Egypt, only other nonmember state.</p>
                        <p>Second session, afternoon, devoted to general statements bringing out
                            especially on the part of Great Britain a warning against undue
                            expectation of complete accomplishment of the entire task at this time.
                            Smaller countries expressed general reserve awaiting action [of]
                            neighbors and stronger states industrially. I made no statement.</p>

                        <p>4. Third session, morning, general discussion continued. Roumanian
                            delegation introduced following text either to be included in article 1
                            or as special declaration: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is understood that the present agreement does not apply to
                                    export and import, each state reserving the right to determine
                                    its own customs tariffs.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Since this is in some respects similar to your desires as outlined in
                            criticism of article 1, contained in your 65, October 6th, I consulted
                            Roumanian delegate after session, pointed out difficulty for us to urge
                            acceptance of an article mentioning “export duties” and mentioned our
                            desire to specify right to counteract dumping and bounties. Roumanian
                            delegate suggested that if I would introduce, as substitute for his
                            resolution, the following text he would immediately withdraw his and
                            support ours. Text follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is understood that the present agreement does not apply to

                        <p>Does Department feel that this text is sufficient for our needs? If so,
                            it gives a convenient way to enter this question with full support of
                            another nation. Urgent reply requested.</p>
                        <p>Dutch delegation stated that if they surrender the right to impose
                            restrictions, they would be giving up their only weapon against nations
                            of excessive tariffs. Therefore, the cooperation of Dutch delegation in
                            this convention could only be expected if the convention includes a
                            declaration against excessive tariffs which constitute another handicap
                            to free intercourse.</p>
                        <p>Fourth session afternoon. President announced that he intended to form
                            very small committees of <hi rend="italic">rapporteurs</hi>. He had
                            grouped the articles of similar nature into four groups and would form
                            eventually four such committees as follows: <list>
                                <item>Group 1. Articles 1, 6, 9 and 10.</item>
                                <item>Group 2. Articles 2, 3, 11.</item>
                                <item>Group 3. Articles 8 and 12.</item>
                                <item>Group 4. Articles 4, 5 and 7.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>He added that there would be debate and explanation of amendments in
                            plenary session; that all amendments would then be returned to small
                            group for classifying and reporting back to the Conference <pb n="268"
                                xml:id="pg_268" facs="0354"/>with recommendations. He then opened
                            discussion on article 1. Amendments were proposed by Italian and British
                            delegations both tending to emphasize reciprocal character of
                            contractual obligations. Since document C.I.A.P.1, page 20, paragraph 2,
                            assumes obligations could only be held to extend to contracting states,
                            a principle corroborated in paragraph 1 of discussion article 6, on page
                            24, I offered no objection to this interpretation. Extended discussion
                            followed as to rights of noncontracting states under most-favored-nation
                            clauses which was inconclusive. This I believe is not a question which
                            can be settled by this Conference.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of point 6 followed. Some doubts were cast by French and
                            British delegations as to necessity for this article. I stated that we
                            considered this article necessary and reserved the right to offer an
                            amendment and explain it subsequently.</p>
                        <p>Debate on article 9 was inconclusive and reverted to the previous
                            discussion on rights of noncontracting states under most-favored-nation
                            clause, since certain states feared obligation to grant concessions to
                            such noncontracting states. Great Britain made the only tangible
                            proposal, namely, that the number of states in blank should be double
                            the number of those holding permanent seats on the Council and states
                            listed in appendix should be those holding permanent seats. I desire
                            more time to shape views for recommendations on this subject. It may be
                            advisable to await report of <hi rend="italic">reviseurs</hi> before
                            making recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Article 10 was not specifically discussed.</p>
                        <p>President announced that at plenary session tomorrow articles 2 and 3
                            will be taken up, adding that <hi rend="italic">reviseurs</hi> would
                            begin work in group 1 after morning plenary session.</p>

                        <p>5. Fifth session, morning. I offered an amendment striking out word
                            “third” in third line article 6 making brief statement embodying second
                            paragraph your criticism, page 12, instruction 65, and pointing out that
                            this amendment was in accord with interpretation contained page 24
                            document C.I.A.P.1.</p>
                        <p>President then called for debate on second group (see my 4, October 18,
                            10 p.m., reporting fourth session), article 2, some discussion <pb
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0355"/>in which I took no part on
                            scope of article as to whether it refers purely to customs or other
                            matters. Debate inconclusive and somewhat perfunctory.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Article 3. I introduced redraft of article and made brief
                                statement following closely instructions your 65. While no exception
                                was taken to the idea of incorporating in some form provisions of
                                the convention of November 3, 1923, vigorous debate took place on
                                subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>), French and Italian
                                delegations opposing its inculsion on the ground that scope is too
                                broad and would necessitate another conference to debate it.
                                Austrians and Poles supported subparagraph (<hi rend="italic"
                                >e</hi>) but Austrians desired elimination of phrase “having regard
                                to the normal volume of trade of the respective countries in the
                                particular class of goods in question.” Being requested by the
                                President at the instigation of Dutch delegation to explain this
                                phrase, I stated that it is not to be considered as a mathematical
                                formula but as a principle which supplements the previous phrase “an
                                equitable share of such importation or exportation.”</item>
                            <item>Article 11. No debate on this article. In view of the somewhat
                                delicate position of America in this matter I preferred not to carry
                                out in plenary session instruction on page 14 your 65 but to talk
                                over matter informally with President pointing out our difficulty
                                and requesting his cooperation. Will report results.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Chair announced no plenary session for afternoon but meetings of groups 1

                        <p>5. Your 4, October 18, 10 p.m. As long as there is probability of
                            usefully employing the draft article concerning export duties set forth
                            in Department’s 1, October 17, 5 p.m., Rumanian text, even as revised,
                            would be unsatisfactory because conflicting. Bearing in mind that
                            Rumania employs export duties extensively, at least for revenue
                            purposes, you may consider whether you would care to suggest privately
                            to your Rumanian colleague that in view of the Economic Conference
                            recommendations regarding export duties, he would wish to substitute
                            “import” for “customs” in his revised text. Alternatively, you might
                            allow the present Rumanian text to be adopted tentatively and make the
                            change indicated in case later developments should bring about adoption
                            of article on export duties. Department leaves to your discretion time

                        <p>Article 3. Discussion hinged on American amendment reported my 5, October
                            19, 2 p.m. Detailed information was requested on exact interpretation of
                            phrases occurring in subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) notably
                            “equitable share”, “normal volume of trade” and last sentence.
                            Delegation was embarrassed by lack of specific interpretation (see my 2,
                            October 18, 1 p.m.<note n="16" xml:id="d216fn16">Not printed.</note>).
                            Very determined opposition developed to subparagraph (<hi rend="italic"
                                >e</hi>) in the present form, notably, that it involved principles
                            of wider scope than contemplated in draft of convention and introduced

                        <p>Convinced that we could not obtain full satisfaction on this article, I
                            stated that I would refer this compromise to you, reserving the right to
                            reopen the question in case your decision was unfavorable. The
                            Department may prefer the phraseology which seems preferable to me,
                            namely, to begin the last paragraph: “The Conference is of the opinion
                            that an equitable allocation, et cetera”. If so I should nevertheless
                            appreciate instructions as to whether I should accept the <pb n="271"
                                xml:id="pg_271" facs="0357"/>original phraseology in the event that
                            I am unable to cause the adoption of this alteration. Furthermore, you
                            may care to provide for the difficulty outlined on page 4, middle
                            paragraph your 65, by insisting on the insertion after the word “quotas”
                            of the words “to other contracting states”.</p>

                                obligations extend to contracting parties only, also that question
                                of obligations of individual contracting parties under treaties of
                                their own with particular states ought not to be discussed at this
                                Conference. For your own information, however, it appears that a
                                most-favored-nation provision in the form now being included in the
                                treaties we are negotiating, if included in a treaty between this
                                Government and a state party to the proposed convention, would
                                oblige such state to extend to American commerce any favor that,
                                under the convention, it extended to parties thereto, regardless of
                                whether the United States were such a party. It should be observed,
                                however, that Article VII of the treaty proposed by the United
                                States to Austria and to other countries, calls for equitable rather
                                than equal treatment in respect of rations or quotas.<note n="17"

                        <p>7. Your No. 8, October 19, 11 p.m. As some time may elapse before
                            provisions of a convention to abolish prohibitions and restrictions
                            become fully effective, and as numerous exceptions seem likely to be
                            adopted, Department holds view that article 3 is of importance and
                            wishes you to make every reasonable effort to have this article adopted
                            approximately in form in which you proposed it in accordance with
                            Department’s instructions.</p>
                        <p>Department is fearful that any provision in a multilateral convention
                            less positive and inclusive than provisions it wishes to incorporate in
                            its bilateral treaties will weaken its position in negotiating such
                            treaties. Accordingly, question presents itself whether it might not be
                            preferable to omit article 3 altogether if unobtainable in reasonably
                            satisfactory form. Most of the other countries are probably parties to
                            convention for simplification of customs formalities and are, in
                            consequence, bound by its provisions whether or not it is quoted or
                            referred to in convention now being drafted.</p>
                        <p>Essential portion of subdivision (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) is, in
                            Department’s opinion, the part requiring granting of licenses and
                            assignment of quotas and formalities of whatever kind to be equitable.
                            If you are able to obtain provision substantially to this effect you may
                            accept it and consent to omission of rest of other provisions of
                            subdivision (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>), including the one regarding
                            normal value to trade.</p>
                        <p>Department perceives no serious objection to draft introduction as
                            proposed by French starting at “In the event that”, but thinks drafting
                            is not as good as your substitute. As meaning is substantially same,
                            Department perceives no reason to change our draft. Not clear,
                            furthermore, why French should object to declaration in agreement but
                            should be willing to insert it in final act.</p>
                        <p>Rather than include nonbinding provisions in final act or elsewhere, the
                            Department suggests for your consideration that, after the precedent of
                            the Customs Formalities Conference of 1923, provisions be included when
                            they are acceptable to most states but be subject to reservations by
                            states finding difficulties. Before any such arrangement is proposed,
                            however, please comment and request final instructions.</p>
                        <p>If you are not able to have included provision substantially equivalent
                            to paragraph (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>), report your recommendations and
                            request instructions.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>Your suggestion that “to other contracting states” follow “quotas” is
                            approved, but Department does not regard this matter as of great
                            importance.</p>

                        <p>11. Sixth session. British introduced fairly satisfactory article
                            relating to prison-made goods. Also one embodying ideas similar to yours
                            on standards. I introduced yours on standards and, knowing British were
                            introducing one on other question, refrained for the moment from doing
                            so. Also introduced in accordance with instructions amendments on
                            article 4, paragraphs 6, 9, and 10 and on article 7. Since article 5 is
                            the crucial one I withheld amendment for the moment to watch course of
                            events.</p>
                        <p>Exception was taken by Italians, French, and Germans to a further
                            paragraph under article 4 relative to standards. I therefore made a
                            statement to dispel idea that our regulations constituted a barrier to
                            trade and endeavored to demonstrate that they are great assistance to
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>President then declared that unless Conference would refrain from details
                            and attack essence of problem he would be compelled to call on us one by
                            one for our declaration as to whether we desired in general to
                            strengthen the convention or to weaken it. The British desired in
                            general to eliminate from scope of convention everything which is not
                            strictly of economic nature and preached the principle of making a
                            document such as could be signed by the maximum number of states. The
                            Germans insisted on revision of paragraph 1 of article 4 to cover only
                            arms and munitions of war. The Italians are inclined to agree with the
                            Germans while the French made no secret of their dissatisfaction with
                            the present situation relative to British dye restrictions. This is
                            behind a great portion of discussion going on between these four nations
                            but it has not clearly come to surface yet. I learn that the British
                            intend, if it comes to the surface, to defend the dye restrictions under
                            article 4, paragraph 1 as necessary for national defense to build an
                            industry capable of producing explosives.</p>
                        <p>I presented general survey without going into details, reserving that for
                            the subcommittee, on our views respecting the articles under debate,
                            namely, 4, 5 and 7. (See my 12, October 20, 10 p.m.)</p>
                        <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0360"/>
                        <p>French made interesting suggestion that import restrictions should be
                            considered separately from export restrictions. This might furnish a
                            solution of many difficulties since it would give opportunity for
                            separate consideration of raw material problems and for maintaining
                            concise phraseology on import restrictions. Unless I am instructed to
                            the contrary I propose to offer no objection to such procedure since it
                            may offer possibility of agreement which looks doubtful at present.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing, today’s debate much more important than preceding and shows
                            wide divergence of views as to what form convention should take. Can
                            make no predictions at the present time.</p>

                        <p>12, My 11, October 20, 10 p.m. I spoke extemporaneously approximately to
                            the following effect in the important sections of the speech. Relative
                            to article 7, I followed instructions closely.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“With regard to article 5 French delegate Serruys was inspired to
                                make the very wise suggestion that we could have the benefit of this
                                debate and the benefit of other suggestions made by other
                                delegations before putting in certain of our amendments. We have
                                been working on an amendment which we have not yet phrased to our
                                satisfaction but which we expect to submit. With reference to the
                                words ‘to protect the vital economic and financial interests’ we
                                feel that this clause is so broad that its effect might nullify the
                                purpose of this convention. We fear that under the guise of ‘vital
                                interests’ so many exceptions and prohibitions and limitations can
                                be imposed that the convention may prove of little value if finished
                                in this form. What we are therefore seeking is some phraseology
                                which can perhaps be substituted therefor and we suggest ‘in case of
                                war or national calamity’. I do not feel that this constitutes such
                                a change in article 5 as to merit the reproach that this is in
                                effect something quite different from what was anticipated.</p>
                            <p>With respect to article 4 we feel that we are undertaking a very
                                solemn obligation when we sign this document and that therefore we
                                must know exactly to the last iota the scope and extent of the
                                obligations which we undertake before affixing our signature
                                thereto. We believe that the exchange must be reduced to the
                                necessary minimum but we lay as much emphasis upon the word <hi
                                    rend="italic">necessary</hi> as we do upon the word <hi
                                    rend="italic">minimum</hi>. Despite opinions expressed to the
                                effect that article 2 or other articles may cover any necessary
                                exceptions we are not perfectly certain that an international court
                                which after all is the last resort would agree with the opinions
                                expressed. We therefore want to know before rather than after the
                                fact exactly where we stand. I want to emphasize in connection <pb
                                    n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0361"/>with article 4 simply that
                                we must know just where we stand and we must therefore insist or
                                rather urge the acceptance of such a resolution as we submitted
                                regarding standards. Also we must adhere to [and] urge the
                                acceptance of a further resolution proposed by the British
                                delegation regarding prison-made goods which falls within another
                                category of our laws. In so doing we do not feel that we are
                                loosening the convention but rather making it more exact and more
                                obligatory than it is in its present form.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Sir Sidney Chapman’s statement that he felt that the
                                path to follow was to draw up the kind of document that would induce
                                a maximum number of states to adhere thereto, of course we also want
                                to see the maximum number of states adhere to that document. We feel
                                however that there is a certain danger that the Conference may be
                                led in its desire to gather all the states into such fold to
                                sanction international practices which we are brought together to
                                abolish.”</p>

                        <p>8. Your No. 11, October 20, 10 a.m. Department authorizes you at your
                            discretion to associate yourself with the French suggestion that import
                            and export restrictions be considered separately, and affirmatively urge
                            its adoption. It is Department’s view that if suggestion be adopted it
                            might react favorably in solving raw materials and other problems, not
                            in present discussions alone but in future international conferences.
                            Your attention is invited to Department’s No. 1, October 17, 5 p.m.,
                            paragraph No. 4.</p>

                        <p>13. Group 2, second meeting. Many thanks for prompt instructions in your
                            October 20, 8 p.m., on basis of which I presented our point of view
                            regarding French proposal reported in my 8, October 19, 11 p.m. I was
                            unable to obtain in entirety text desired but believe that a
                            satisfactory compromise was reached. It reads as follows: <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0362"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the case of any prohibitions or restrictions which may be
                                    applied within the limits set by the present agreement, the
                                    contracting states shall in the matter of licenses comply
                                    strictly with the following provisions (first follows (<hi

                                    referred to on page 3, last paragraph your 65, and a further
                                    paragraph reading as follows:) “As regards the allocation of
                                    quotas, the contracting states, without laying down any rule as
                                    to the method to be adopted, consider that an equitable
                                    distribution of these quotas is an essential condition of an
                                    equitable treatment of commerce between states.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I explained that we were primarily concerned with the obligatory
                            character of the contractual obligations and that therefore I preferred
                            that this should be incorporated in the body of the convention. However,
                            it was pointed out, and I think correctly, that the last paragraph is
                            not of such a nature as normally to be included in the body or text of a
                            convention. The committee agreed, however, to incorporate in the
                            protocol the following words: “The present protocol will have the same
                            force, effect and duration as the convention of today’s date, of which
                            it is to be considered as an integral part.”</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the Department will be preoccupied rather with the
                            binding force of this obligation than with its position in the text and
                            since we are satisfied on the first point I acquiesced in this
                            arrangement.</p>

                        <p>14. Group 2, article 11. In accordance with the intention which I
                            reported in my 5, October 19, 2 p.m., I approached the President of the
                            Conference and explained to him our difficulties regarding this article
                            with a view to achieving its elimination if possible. Colijn stated that
                            he would use every endeavor to find a satisfactory formula but that he
                            considered, and he knew that the Conference agreed with him, that some
                            obligation to report was necessary because of the recalcitrant states in
                            which they could not place confidence. He considered this an essential
                            portion of the convention.</p>
                        <p>In this afternoon’s session fortunately the Egyptian delegate, also
                            representing a nonmember state, suggested an alternative phraseology for

                            this initiative on the part of the Egyptian representative since I also
                            had been troubled about this article; that I would at once report this

                        <p>From my conversation with Colijn, I am convinced that the convention will
                            carry some article of this nature and after careful consideration and
                            study of similar documents the text quoted above seems as satisfactory
                            from our point of view as can be secured. Short of signing with a

                        <p>16. Group 1, Article 6. The <hi rend="italic">rapporteurs</hi> maintained
                            the standpoint that in view of altered drafting of article 1 the
                            necessity for article 6 no longer existed. The French delegation made
                            suggestion that the question of the rights of retaliation for acts
                            foreseen in article 6 should be referred to the group which handled
                            article 7 on arbitration; since on the nature of the arbitration
                            obligation depended the phraseology relative to rights of retaliation I
                            made a statement based on your 65<note n="20" xml:id="d225fn20"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_254">p.
                                254</ref>.</note> pointing out in addition the intent of the
                            Economic Committee as outlined on page 24 of C.I.A.P.1.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">rapporteurs</hi> were of the opinion that article 6
                            was intended to apply only to the relation between contracting and
                            noncontracting states and to provide a method of retaliation against
                            violators of the convention. It was evident that the Economic Committee
                            had had no intention in drafting this article of authorizing tariff
                            reprisals such as are contemplated in section 317.</p>
                        <p>The chairman requested me not to insist further at the present time on
                            this matter, expressly stating that each state of course retained the
                            right to put in further amendments and proposals to protect their
                            necessary interests. I had no recourse but to acquiesce.</p>
                        <p>I subsequently had conversation with two members of the Economic
                            Committee separately. Both of them insisted on the following thesis—that
                            the preoccupation of the American delegation relative to its rights to
                            enforce tariff measures was unfounded; that nothing in this convention
                            would or could be construed as affecting the right of any contracting
                            state in this respect, either in reference to noncontracting or
                            contracting states; that since article 6 as well as the whole convention
                            did not envisage tariff matters but merely those prohibitions and
                            restrictions treated under this convention, the importance of article 6
                            disappeared under the revised form of article 1.</p>
                        <p>Serruys, the French representative, for his part stated that if we were
                            prepared to suggest any obligation relative to tariffs he was <pb
                                n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0365"/>willing to introduce and urge a
                            resolution in the final act expressly stating that nothing in this
                            convention could be construed as interfering with the right of a state
                            to adopt such tariff measures as conformed with its necessities, but
                            that the Conference believed that no state should impose tariff measures
                            in such a way as to thereby replace the restrictions which might be
                            eliminated by this convention.</p>
                        <p>This brings up a thought to which Department may desire to give careful
                            consideration, namely, whether such a general disclaimer of the purpose
                            of this convention not to interfere in tariff measures is not a
                            sufficient guarantee of our right to take any action envisaged by
                            section 317.</p>
                        <p>If the Department is interested in this thought, please so instruct me
                            and I will request Serruys to draft for transmission to Department what
                            he proposes to insert. Your criticisms in advance of his proposal would
                            be helpful.</p>

                        <p>17. Department’s 65, October 6. On analysis of paragraphs of article 4 it
                            appears to us that the question of “standards,” which you bring up on
                            page 10, may well be covered without further necessary article under
                            paragraph 7, article 4, provided we obtain insertion of the words “and
                            exported” after the word “imported”. May I request consideration and
                            instructions on this point?</p>
                        <p>Considerable reluctance has been expressed in the debate to the general
                            idea of extending the list of articles and it might be easier for us to

                            <item>Department does not doubt correctness of thesis on which two
                                members of Economic Committee insist, but nevertheless it wishes
                                insertion at appropriate time and place of a provision such as
                                Department suggested in instruction No. 65, October 6. As far as
                                duties are concerned, Mr. Serruys’ proposition is satisfactory,
                                though we should prefer “import duties” instead of “tariff
                                measures”.</item>

                            <item>This disclaimer is not sufficient, however, to safeguard section
                                317 of Tariff Act, under the terms of which the President is
                                authorized, should additional duties fail, to proclaim prohibitions.
                                It follows that if article 6 be omitted, or be inapplicable, you
                                should arrange as unobtrusively as possible for an exception, either
                                in article 4 or somewhere else, to cover this contingency. Following
                                wording is satisfactory to Department:<note n="21" xml:id="d228fn21"

                        <p>Section 317 of Tariff Act is especially important at present by reason of

                            Accordingly, the Department cannot agree to any obligation that would
                            weaken article 317 as an instrument with which commercial equality may
                            be obtained. Closely observe Serruys’ attitude toward language
                            calculated to except prohibitions which are made for retaliation against
                            discrimination; and report observations to Department.</p>

                        <p>54. Plenary session this morning discussed Rumanian reservation export of
                            crude oil, (see my 50, November 3, 8 p.m.<note n="23" xml:id="d229fn23"
                                >Not printed.</note>). Much opposition was expressed to acceptance
                            of the reservation under paragraph 2, article 6, of protocol, without
                            guarantees. Finally, Rumanian delegation made this following
                            declaration: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Convention (<hi rend="italic">Conference</hi>] declares
                                    that, in accepting as regards Rumania and having consideration
                                    of its exceptional position <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> and
                                        <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>, the exception of crude
                                    petroleum under paragraph 2 of article 6, it does not give its
                                    approval of measures of prohibition and restriction of this
                                    product which it considers very important for international
                                    markets. The Conference expresses its confidence that Rumania
                                    itself, as soon as circumstances shall permit, will abolish this
                                    prohibition in conformity with the spirit of ad article 6,
                                    paragraph 2, of the protocol of the convention and that
                                    meanwhile it will take into account the interests of neighboring
                                    contracting countries. The Rumanian delegation associates itself
                                    completely in this declaration of the Conference.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The President requested the delegations to state in roll call whether
                            they approved the principle of extending the categories of reservations
                            and whether they therefore voted to accept the Rumanian reservation.
                            This gave us excellent opportunity to go on record as opposed to
                            extending categories and I therefore stated that my Government attached
                            great importance to limiting these as far as possible and that I was
                            therefore obliged to vote against. Mine was the only negative vote
                            though there were nine abstentions.</p>
                        <p>The chairman has now asked me whether the acceptance by the Conference of
                            the Rumanian reservation will prevent my Government from signing. Such
                            signing on our part will now imply acceptance of Rumanian reservation.
                            The reservation in itself appears of no economic importance to the
                            United States and my negative vote was intended, as I explained, only to
                            emphasize our attitude on the principle.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0368"/>
                        <p>The American exception as regards helium gas was accepted without
                            opposition under paragraph 2, article 6 (formerly additional
                            article).</p>
                        <p>It now becomes important to know at once Department’s attitude toward
                            signing. Chairman has called my attention to the fact that unless we can

                            reservation on helium must be dropped for the present from the
                            convention and must be submitted again as one of the reservations to be

                            report concerning the convention relative to the Abolition of
                            Prohibitions and Restrictions on Exports and Imports.</p>
                        <p>The convention falls naturally into certain sub-divisions:</p>
                        <p>Articles 1 and 2 represent the positive achievement of the convention. In
                            these articles the High Contracting Parties undertake to abolish, within
                            a period of six months after the date of the coming into force of the
                            convention, prohibitions and restrictions on export and import.</p>
                        <p>Articles 4, 5 and 6 contain the list of exceptions. Article 4 contains an
                            enumeration of exceptions under which the signatory states reserve the
                            right to maintain prohibitions and restrictions for certain specified
                            purposes. This class of exceptions are all of a permanent nature.</p>
                        <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0369"/>
                        <p>Article 5 provides for those exceptions which may arise of a temporary
                            and unforeseen character. It provides for those acts by states which may
                            be rendered essential by calamities, wars and other unforeseen and
                            non-recurring causes.</p>
                        <p>Article 6 provides for certain stipulated and listed exceptions
                            specifically reserved for individual states, after an examination on
                            their merits, which are either temporary in character or of no
                            importance to international commerce.</p>
                        <p>Articles 8 and 9 are the arbitration clauses, the one obligatory on all
                            signatories of the convention and the other optional for such states as
                            desire to extend the scope of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Articles 3, 7, 10, 11 and 12 are in the nature of explanatory material,
                            making more precise the limits of the rights and obligations assumed
                            under the convention.</p>
                        <p>Articles 14 to 19 inclusive, treat the method of signature, ratification
                            and denunciation, as well as the admission of reservations.</p>
                        <p>As I pointed out in my telegraphic reports from Geneva, it was apparent
                            to one who followed the matter closely that from the first day of the
                            conference the greatest difficulty which would be encountered lay in the
                            determination of the British Delegation to maintain their prohibitions
                            and limitations relative to the import of dye stuffs. Nearly all the
                            other delegations expressed themselves ready to abolish without
                            reservation restrictions and prohibitions. (Whether this was done
                            because they knew that they were entirely safe in promising such
                            procedure because they knew the British would stand firm in their
                            decision, or whether this announcement represented sincere conviction is
                            impossible to say with any degree of certainty. In any case all the
                            principal states are on record as being willing to abolish restrictions
                            and prohibitions, with the exception of those of no commercial
                            importance, if Great Britain will abolish this one restriction.)
                            Therefore, when the moment came to discuss the list of exceptions (now
                            appearing in articles 4, 5 and 6), the conference was faced with the
                            choice either of writing a convention so phrased as to admit the claim
                            of Great Britain and thus permit her to be a signatory, or to draft a
                            convention as tight as or tighter than the original draft of the
                            Economic Committee. Great Britain would then not have signed the
                            convention. Rightly or wrongly, the choice was made in favor of the
                            first alternative and it can be said roughly that the type of convention
                            which issued from the conference was designed in its broad lines to meet
                            the needs of Great Britain and make it possible for that nation to be a
                            signatory.</p>
                        <p>As I examine the protocol to the convention, it does not seem necessary
                            to enter into any detailed analysis. The articles are interpretative in
                            character and those which are of particular interest to <pb n="284"
                                xml:id="pg_284" facs="0370"/>us I have discussed already in my
                            preceding reports, both telegraphic and written.</p>
                        <p>Also in regard to the Final Act, if the Department will be good enough to
                            consult the Legation’s despatches Nos. 170 of November 9, 1927 and 171
                            of November 10, 1927, together with my telegram from Geneva, No. 59 of
                            November 7, 11 p.m.,<note n="25" xml:id="d231fn25">None printed; for

                                    Conference</hi>, p. 140.</note> it will have before it a
                            complete outline of the articles to which we took exception and of the
                            failure to have these exceptions accepted by the conference. I merely
                            reiterate what I have before stated, that the Final Act has no binding
                            force, it is not signed by the delegates as Plenipotentiaries of their
                            Government, but is open for signature to any person who attended the
                            Conference. It is a compilation of resolutions adopted by the
                            individuals attending the conference. A signatory state may instruct its
                            delegate to sign the convention and protocol without instructing him to
                            sign the Final Act.</p>
                        <p>Relative to the convention itself, I append herewith an analysis<note
                                n="26" xml:id="d231fn26">Not printed.</note> in which the
                            convention, as finally signed, is compared article by article with the
                            original draft text of the convention issued by the Economic Committee.
                            At the same time short notes and comments are appended, together with
                            reference to those telegrams and despatches which deal with the
                            particular subject. In the preparation of this annex I am indebted in a
                            large measure to Dr. Lyon, the Commercial Attaché of this Legation.</p>
                        <p>Certain observations of a general nature occur to me. The convention, as
                            the Department will note, is of a reciprocal nature and this theory of
                            reciprocity has been emphasized in article 1. The benefits of the
                            abolition of restrictions and prohibitions accrue only to those states
                            which sign the convention. As a corollary to this situation there is
                            nothing to prevent a state signatory to the convention from increasing
                            in any way it sees fit its present categories of prohibitions and
                            restrictions as against a state which is not a signatory to the
                            convention, so long as such action does not unduly affect the trade of
                            another signatory power.</p>
                        <p>There are certain faults, some obvious and some not so visible in the
                            convention. It is to be regretted that exceptions are permitted of any
                            class or kind. The convention would have been a simpler document and a
                            much more satisfactory document, from our point of view, had the
                            original text of the Economic Committee not only been adhered to but
                            strengthened, especially as to article 5. Also the further meeting which
                            will take place in the early summer of 1928 <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
                                facs="0371"/>will be faced with a number of very thorny questions;
                            for example, the decision as to what states must ratify the convention
                            before it enters into effect. It is a pity that this decision had to be
                            deferred to a future date but there seemed no possibility of reaching a
                            solution until the convention was finally drawn up and until a full
                            knowledge was available of all the reservations that would form part of
                            it. Also the permission for states to introduce other reservations up to
                            February 1st which may be discussed at this future conference may bring
                            further difficult questions, although urgent pleas were made in the
                            conference and the hope was expressed that the reservations should
                            rather be reduced than; increased by that time. The long delay which
                            must elapse before the convention can be effective (at the earliest this
                            can hardly take place before the summer of 1929) is also a source of
                            regret. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that a signatory
                            power undertakes not to increase its prohibitions or restrictions during
                            this period.</p>
                        <p>As opposed to these weaknesses there would appear to be certain
                            advantages which would accrue to the United States if it participated in
                            this treaty. In spite of the many reservations, there will be, if the
                            treaty goes into force, an enormous number of prohibitions and
                            restrictions abolished. The reservations do not appear to be of such a
                            nature that they greatly affect the trade of the United States, whereas
                            many of the restrictions that will be dropped in favor of signatory
                            states do so affect our trade very seriously.</p>
                        <p>Should the Government of the United States decide that this treaty should
                            be signed I call attention to the fact that it would be well if this
                            decision were taken before the 1st of February 1928, since states
                            signing the treaty after that date may not present reservations under
                            article 6.<note n="27" xml:id="d231fn27">The convention was signed on
                                the part of the United States, Jan. 30, 1928; Department of State

                            our prohibition of export of helium is adequately covered in article 4,
                            paragraph 2, there were others who took a contrary view. I consider it
                            advisable, therefore, in the event that we do sign, that we should make
                            a definite reservation regarding helium and not be put on the defensive
                            in the future regarding our maintenance of this prohibition.</p>

                        <p>Professor Adams called at the Office of the Economic Adviser on Thursday
                            afternoon, March 10, 1927, for the purpose of discussing with officers
                            of the Department of State certain questions suggested by Professor
                            Adams’ mission to represent this Government at the forthcoming League of
                            Nations Conference on double taxation. <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287"
                                facs="0373"/>Those present were, besides Professor Adams, Doctor
                            Arthur 1ST. Young, Economic Adviser; Mr. C. M. Barnes, Assistant
                            Solicitor; Mr. F. D. K. LeClercq, of the Division of Western European
                            Affairs, and Mr. Wallace McClure, Assistant to the Economic Adviser.</p>
                        <p>Professor Adams discussed briefly certain recent developments in the
                            matter of double taxation among European countries, especially the
                            considerable multiplication of bilateral treaties for the purpose of
                            avoiding double taxation. He mentioned the fact that the program of the
                            forthcoming Conference calls for the preparation of a model bilateral
                            treaty for recommendation to countries which may desire to negotiate on
                            the subject. Those present were inclined to the view that while a
                            multilateral convention, open to signature by all countries, would
                            theoretically, at least, prove a better solution to the problem of
                            double taxation, such a solution might not now be practicable.</p>
                        <p>Professor Adams inquired concerning the attitude of the Department of
                            State toward treaty provisions winch might have the effect of overruling
                            Acts of Congress. He had in mind the possibility of a convention on
                            double taxation later being negotiated that might contain provisions
                            different from those of our national revenue laws. The representatives
                            of the Department of State stated that as a matter of policy the
                            Department undertook so far as possible to avoid placing in its treaties
                            provisions which might be in conflict with existing statute law. It was
                            suggested that it would be best to put in the next revenue law some
                            general provision contemplating reciprocal agreements to avoid double
                            taxation.</p>
                        <p>The possible usefulness of the most-favored-nation clause in solving the
                            problem of double taxation was discussed. Professor Adams inquired
                            particularly whether provisions in recent commercial treaties might have
                            any relation to the problem in hand. The representatives of the
                            Department of State were of opinion that the most-favored-nation clause
                            in the treaty with Germany (December 8, 1923)<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d234fn32"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_29"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >ii</hi>, p. 29</ref>.</note> and similar treaties
                            subsequently concluded, did not apply to internal taxation, and that the
                            provisions in Article I and Article VIII of the German treaty in regard
                            to taxation did not provide for most-favored-nation treatment. It is
                            customary in treaties to accord national rather than most-favored-nation
                            treatment. It was further suggested that the most-favored-nation clause
                            would probably not be useful in solving matters of double taxation at
                            the present time. The practice of various countries, so far as the
                            imposition of double taxation is concerned, is now so diverse as to make
                            it of doubtful policy for a country to promise in advance to accord to
                            any particular country as good treatment as it may bargain for in the
                            future with <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0374"/>some third country.
                            It was thought that the right to make special bargains on the subject,
                            without being committed in advance to generalize the concessions
                            granted, would for the present, perhaps, be the appropriate policy for
                            this Government to follow.</p>
                        <p>Professor Adams indicated that he expected concrete results from the
                            forthcoming Conference and that, though at first dubious of the
                            practical purposes of those backing it, he was now convinced that they
                            intended to accomplish something, and that the countries of Europe were
                            prepared to come to agreements on many points, reserving other points
                            for the reconciliation of differences of opinion and probable agreement
                            in the future.</p>

                            common accord and subject to ratification, concluded the following
                            Convention:</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> 1—<hi rend="italic"
                                >Definitions</hi></p>
                        <p>In the present Convention:</p>
                        <p>The term “radio communication” applies to the transmission by radio of
                            writing, signs, signals, pictures, and sounds of all kinds by means of
                            Hertzian waves.</p>
                        <p>The term “radio communication station” or simply “station” means a
                            station equipped to carry on radio communications.</p>
                        <p>The term “fixed station” means a station permanently located and
                            communicating with one or more stations similarly located.</p>
                        <p>The term “mobile station” means a station capable of moving and which
                            ordinarily does move.</p>
                        <p>The term “land station” means a station other than a mobile station used
                            for radio communication with mobile stations.</p>
                        <p>The term “mobile service” means the radio communication service carried
                            on between mobile stations and land stations, and by mobile stations
                            communicating among themselves.</p>
                        <p>The term “international service” means a radio communication service
                            between a station in one country and a station in another country, or
                            between a land station and a mobile station located outside the limits
                            of the country in which the land station is situated, or between two or
                            more mobile stations on or over the high seas. An internal or national
                            radio communication service which is likely to cause interference with
                            other services outside the limits of the country in which it operates is
                            considered as an international service from the viewpoint of
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>The term “general communication system” means all the existing telegraph
                            and telephone channels of communication, wire and radio, open to public
                            service, but excluding the radio communication channels of the mobile
                            service.</p>
                        <p>The term “public service” means a service for the use of the general
                            public.</p>
                        <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>The term “limited service” means a service which may be used only by
                            specified persons or for specific purposes.</p>
                        <p>The term “public correspondence” means all radio communications which a
                            station, by reason of being open to public service, must accept from the
                            public for transmission.</p>
                        <p>The term “private enterprise” means any person, company, or corporation
                            which operates one or more stations for radio communication.</p>
                        <p>The term “radiotelegram” means a telegram originating in or destined to a
                            mobile station, transmitted by radio over all or part of its route.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The return to its rightful owners
                            of Austrian property held by the Alien Property Custodian is a matter in
                            which the Federal Government of Austria is deeply concerned.
                            Insignificant as the amount involved may appear in comparison to the
                            figures tipping the scale of financial and economic balance in the
                            United States it is of no small consequence in the combine of measures
                            partly taken partly under contemplation in Austria with a view of
                            restoring private business to a state of normalcy. It is the conviction
                            of my Government that the successful restoration of public household
                            could only be of lasting duration, if the efforts made in aforementioned
                            direction will meet a like success.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian property is held, as Your Excellency are aware of, as a
                            security, to insure payment of claims, which the Government or citizens
                            of the United States or both may have against the Austrian Government
                            for damages resulting from acts of war. These potential claims, claims
                            against the Government, are therefore responsible for the failure of
                            Austrian private citizens and rightful owners obtaining their property
                            seized in this country during the war.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Government of Austria keenly feels this responsibility, the
                            more so, as Congress had in connection with the Winslow-Act<note n="37"
                                xml:id="d236fn37">Approved Mar. 4, 1923; 42 Stat. 1511.</note>
                            resolved, that enemy property in excess of $10,000. should be further
                            retained—until “other suitable provisions” are made by the respective
                            Governments to take care of American War Claims.</p>

                        <p>My Government, as Your Excellency may recall, tried at two previous
                                occasions<note n="38" xml:id="d236fn38">See the Austrian Minister’s

                                was submitted by the Austrian Legation in January 1927 (not
                                printed). The Secretary of the Treasury in a letter to the Secretary
                                of State, Feb. 5, 1927 (not printed), stated that in view of lack of
                                information and the impossibility of obtaining action in the current
                                session of Congress it would be best to defer action until the next
                                session of Congress (file No, 763.72113 Au 7/13).</note> to free
                            private property from restrictions incurred through their own
                            obligations and sought to provide by an agreement for such “other
                            suitable provisions”, which would be accepted in lieu of seized private
                            property and open the way for an Act by Congress returning it to the
                            rightful Austrian owners.</p>
                        <p>These efforts failed for two reasons chiefly.—First, because the work of
                            the Tripartite Claims Commission, adjusting American claims, had not
                            sufficiently progressed to enable a somewhat accurate estimate as to the
                            magnitude of claims involved, and second, because the securities offered
                            by the Austrian Federal Government did not seem to satisfy the
                            Government of the United States and the Treasury Department in
                            particular.</p>
                        <p>The present state of affairs in the Tripartite Claims Commission,
                            however, is now sufficiently advanced to permit a calculation of the
                            sums which in due course of procedure will be charged against the
                            Austrian Federal Government and to make a new and precise offer for
                            their payment.</p>
                        <p>I am in a position to submit on behalf of my Government the following
                            proposal. The Austrian Federal Government is ready to place at the
                            disposal of the Government of the United States the money held in Trust
                            by the Alien Property Custodian for the Austrian Government including
                            the Imperial Royal Tobacco Monopoly also known under the name of K. K.
                            Österreichische Tabak Regie, and to supplement it by a cash deposit up
                            to a total of two and a quarter million dollars. This sum, although it
                            will prove to more than fully cover the awards ultimately to be rendered
                            by the Tripartite Claims Commission and charged against my Government,
                            is offered in this extent with a purpose of allowing an ample margin and
                            removing all conceivable causes which may obstruct a speedy return of
                            seized Austrian property.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian Federal Government asks the Government of the United States
                            to recommend to Congress in course of its next session an Act of
                            legislation which would authorize the Alien Property Custodian to
                            release Austrian property as soon as it has been ascertained in a
                            statement made by competent authorities (Treasury of the United States
                            in agreement with Hon. Edwin Parker, Commissioner, Tripartite Claims
                            Commission) that a sufficient cash amount has been <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0389"/>deposited by the Federal Government of
                            Austria to take care of all her obligations arising from awards rendered
                            and to be rendered by said Commission.</p>
                        <p>The decision, when the moment for making such a declaration has come,
                            will be left entirely to the discretion of the said competent
                            authorities. The Federal Government of Austria believes, however, that
                            in the near future the work of the Tripartite Claims Commission will be
                            far enough advanced to allow, even before a complete adjustment of all
                            claims, a statement as afore indicated.</p>
                        <p>This would be the case f. i. if the Commissioner and the American Agent
                            in course of the proceedings of the Tripartite Claims Commission should
                            come to the conclusion that the total of the awards already rendered as
                            well as the claims still under consideration will at their highest
                            possible extent and value not exceed the 2¼ million cash deposit.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to pray Your Excellency to kindly support my Governments
                            request and offer. I may add that the prerequisite prescribed by
                            Congress for the return of property, i. e. the making of “other <hi
                                rend="italic">suitable</hi> provisions” for the satisfaction of
                            American claims, seems more than fully complied with in the offer of a
                            cash security and payment made by my Government. While in view of
                            American traditions and the policy followed by Your Government the
                            seized private property could hardly be regarded a true collateral,
                            (American opinion being loath to satisfy claims against a Government
                            with property seized from private citizens) the cash deposit of my
                            Government is lacking this deficiency in its character as a security or
                            collateral, offering no moral or judicial objections against its
                            application towards the settlement of just American claims against the
                            Austrian Government.</p>

                            a statement from me outlining the considerations involved in the
                            question whether provision should be made for the return of Austrian and
                            Hungarian property at the same time as provision is made for the return
                            of the German property sequestrated by the Alien Property Custodian, and

                        <p>In a note dated November 29, 1927, the Austrian Minister submitted on
                            behalf of his Government a proposal from which I understand that the
                            Austrian Government is prepared to place at the disposal of the
                            Government of the United States for the purpose of satisfying the awards
                            made against Austria by the Tripartite Claims Commission, United States,
                            Austria and Hungary, a sum of not more than two and one quarter million
                            dollars in cash, this sum to be composed of the funds held by the Alien
                            Property Custodian which at the time of sequestration belonged to the
                            Austrian Government as such, including funds of the State owned Tobacco
                            Monopoly (K. K. Österreichische Tabak Regie), and of such further
                            deposit in cash as may be necessary to bring the total up to the sum of
                            two and one quarter million dollars. If this proposal is acceptable to
                            the Government of the United States, the Austrian Government requests
                            that appropriate recommendation be made to the Congress for the
                            enactment during the present session of an act of legislation
                            authorizing the Alien Property Custodian to release Austrian property as
                            soon as it has been ascertained by the competent authorities (for
                            example, the Treasury Department and the Commissioner of the Tripartite
                            Claims Commission) that the sum of two and one quarter million dollars
                            deposited by the Austrian Government is sufficient to satisfy the awards
                            made by the Commission against Austria. A copy of the note from the
                            Austrian Minister is transmitted herewith.<note n="38a"
                                xml:id="d237fn38a"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note></p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that the figure of two and one quarter million
                            dollars mentioned by the Austrian Minister is based upon an estimate
                            prepared by the Austrian Agent before that Commission of the maximum
                            probable awards against Austria. An estimate has also been prepared by
                            the American Agent, and I transmit herewith a copy of the latter’s
                            memorandum containing his estimate which, you will note, exceeds the two
                            and one quarter million dollars fixed by the Austrian Government as the
                            amount it will make available for the satisfaction of the awards.</p>
                        <p>In considering whether the present proposal of the Austrian Government
                            may be regarded as constituting suitable provision for the satisfaction
                            of the awards made in favor of American claimants, your Committee will
                            no doubt wish to satisfy itself that the amount of the awards with
                            interest will not exceed the sum available for their satisfaction. In
                            this connection there are two considerations which I feel should be
                            brought to your attention.</p>
                        <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>In the first place it should be noted that the Commissioner of the
                            Tripartite Claims Commission has held that, unless the Congress decides
                            to apply the property sequestrated by the Alien Property Custodian to
                            satisfy the awards of the Commission, neither the Austrian nor the

                            the Austrian property sequestrated by the Alien Property Custodian from
                            the charges imposed by the treaties, since under Article 177 of the
                            Treaty of St. Germain (the benefits of which are accorded to the United
                            States by the Treaty signed at Vienna August 24, 1921) Austria accepted
                            responsibility not only for herself, but also for her Allies for the
                            loss and damage caused by the war, and the Austrian property may, in the
                            discretion of the Congress, be applied in satisfaction of Austria’s
                            responsibility for loss and damage caused by Germany and/or Hungary. It
                            should, therefore, be borne in mind that, according to the best
                            information available, the amount of Hungarian property sequestrated by
                            the Alien Property Custodian is not sufficient to meet the probable <pb

                            Commission against Hungary individually, to say nothing of the awards
                            which will be rendered against Austria and Hungary jointly on account of
                            reparation claims, Hungary’s share of which has been fixed by the
                            Commissioner of the Tripartite Claims Commission, United States, Austria
                            and Hungary, at 36.4 per cent of the whole. (Administrative Decision No.
                            I, page 10) In these circumstances the release of the Austrian property
                            apparently would affect directly the interest of claimants against
                            Hungary, and the Committee will undoubtedly wish to consider what
                            provision is to be made to satisfy awards against Hungary in the event
                            that the Austrian and German properties are released. The Department of
                            State has received no proposal on this subject from the Hungarian
                            Government; on the contrary in a memorandum dated December 16,

                            Minister informed the Department that his Government “is not asking for

                            nationals, but expects to deal with this question when it will logically
                            arise at the termination of the work of the Tripartite Claims

                            under Article 161 of the Treaty of Trianon (the benefits of which are
                            accorded to the United States by the treaty signed at Budapest August
                            29, 1921) Hungary accepted responsibility not only for herself but also
                            for her Allies for the loss and damage caused by the war, and the
                            Hungarian property may, in the discretion of the Congress, be applied in
                            satisfaction of Hungary’s responsibility for loss and damage caused by

                                during the war period, except such as are now known to have matured
                                during that period. No exact computation of the interest from
                                varying dates or at different rates has been made, but the interest
                                has been computed at the average rate of four per cent for a period
                                of ten years. All of the claims have been valorized at the pre-war
                                rate of exchange, namely, 9.36 cents to the Kronen. In the case of
                                debts payable in gold or foreign currency, the gold value and the
                                pre-war rate of exchange have been adopted.</p>
                            <p>This is the best and most accurate estimate that the American Agency
                                is able to make with the information now available.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: The following discussion of questions
                            arising in connection with the negotiation of foreign loans by American
                            bankers is transmitted in view of inquiries and suggestions received
                            from diplomatic officers.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Department expects its diplomatic officers to extend to
                            responsible representatives of legitimate American interests, without
                            discriminating between competing American interests, such assistance as
                            may be consistent with their other duties and their diplomatic character
                            (see Instructions to Diplomatic Officers of the United States, March 8,
                            1927, Paragraphs VIII–10, XI–1, XI–7, XI–10, XI–11, XVI–4, and XVI–7).
                            The Department must of course rely largely on the good judgment and
                            sense of propriety of its representatives as to the form of proper
                            assistance. Such assistance normally may include aid in the
                            establishment of contacts, the giving of information, and the making of
                            judicious suggestions, but diplomatic officers will carefully avoid
                            acting as intermediaries or participating in private business
                            transactions, or taking responsibility for decisions of the private
                            American interests concerned.</p>
                        <p>It will be recognized, however, that assistance in the negotiation of
                            loans is affected with considerations of special delicacy, not only
                            because of the reserve customary in any relationship affecting important
                            credit transactions, but also because of tendencies evident in several
                            quarters to emphasize, exaggerate, or misunderstand any relationship of
                            the Department or its officers to financial negotiations. While this
                            does not preclude the assistance normally given to American interests,
                            special care should be taken that the record with respect to financial
                            negotiations be clear and self-explanatory and that diplomatic officers
                            in no way inadvertently lend color to claims or imputations that there
                            exist, between the Department and bankers interested in negotiating
                            foreign loans, relationships involving the responsibility of the
                            Department in connection with such loans.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for example, in cases where there is no obvious occasion for
                            recourse to missions for a letter of introduction, it may be well
                            discreetly to discourage such requests or to satisfy them by giving
                            merely a card of introduction. Similarly, missions should discourage <pb
                                n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0399"/>the transmission of private
                            messages through official channels, or, where the conditions are such as
                            to justify the use of official channels, as in the case of
                            authenticating the signatures of important papers, the text of the
                            message should be self-explanatory as to its private origin and the
                            occasion for the channel of transmission (see Diplomatic Serial No. 28
                                [<hi rend="italic">280</hi>], July 9, 1924).<note n="44"
                                xml:id="d239fn44">Not printed.</note> A United States Senator has
                            cited such a telegraphic authentication as evidence of the Department’s
                            sponsorship of a private loan.</p>
                        <p>Information which diplomatic officers can give in reply to inquiries of
                            bankers is, in the nature of the case, merely supplementary to
                            information otherwise available to them—a well-known manual lists under
                            twenty-five heads “some of the points” to be considered in purchasing
                            foreign Government bonds. Presumably it will be oral, personal in tone,
                            and accompanied with some disclaimer of relieving the bankers of any
                            part of the responsibility toward bond buyers which the ethics and
                            practices of investment banking impose upon them with respect to
                            sponsoring flotations of foreign and domestic issues alike. In this
                            connection the following is quoted from the Annual Report of the
                            Secretary of the Treasury for the year ended June 30, 1926: <quote

                                    or not the risk is to be accepted. The test of the security of a
                                    foreign loan does not differ from the test of the security of a
                                    domestic loan.”</p>

                                1922<note n="46" xml:id="d239fn46">Not printed.</note>), the
                            Department should require of American bankers, in the case of loans for
                            industrial purposes, a guarantee that the books of the borrower have
                            been audited by responsible accountants, or that the Department should
                            at least ask its missions abroad whether they know of any reason why the
                            Department should object to a loan.</p>
                        <p>The Department, in its announcement of March 3, 1922, and its letters to
                            bankers pursuant to the announcement, has uniformly stated that it will
                            not pass upon the merits of foreign loans as business propositions, nor
                            assume any responsibility whatever in connection with loan transactions.
                            In view of the consideration that if the Department in some instances
                            raises questions of the investment merit of particular loans, it may
                            soon be considered to have no doubt <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"
                                facs="0400"/>of the investment merit of a loan when it expresses
                            none, correspondence pursuant to that announcement is the most
                            inappropriate occasion for giving bankers credit information.</p>
                        <p>American bankers may at will, and frequently do, have recourse for
                            information to the Department of Commerce, which is charged with the
                            dissemination of commercial information and which has established in the
                            Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce a Finance and Investment
                            Division. This is the normal channel for inquiry for such bankers as may
                            desire to supplement other available information with that obtainable
                            from the information services of the Government. Subject to such
                            censorship and editing as the Department may undertake, reports of
                            foreign service officers on financial subjects are transmitted in
                            routine to the Department of Commerce. It is felt that only in case of
                            information presumably not available through this or other channels to
                            bankers exercising due diligence would there arise the exceptional case
                            of any ethical obligation on the part of the Department of State to
                            volunteer credit information to bankers writing the Department for the
                            entirely different purpose of allowing it to express its views on the
                            possible national interests involved in a contemplated loan.</p>
                        <p>While the Department feels that in view of their responsibilities bankers
                            contemplating the issue of foreign loans must rely primarily upon
                            independent investigation and study and only incidentally upon
                            Governmental sources of information, the Department welcomes the
                            interest which diplomatic officers have taken in reporting particular
                            credit situations regarding which they feel concern.</p>
                        <p>Such reports are carefully observed by the Department of State and other
                            Departments and, in view of the breadth and importance of American
                            interest in foreign investments, they may serve a very useful purpose
                            through such confidential dissemination as they may be given by the
                            Department of Commerce or as information in the possession of the
                            Department in the event of direct consultation of the Department by
                            interested American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The Department indicates objection to loans only in view of important
                            interests of national policy. Regarding situations of this degree of
                            importance it will ordinarily have in its possession sufficient
                            information to guide its action without <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                            consultation of its missions. At times it has consulted its missions
                            upon receiving an inquiry from bankers but the establishment of a
                            routine practice of doing so would not be justified in view of the
                            simplicity of the questions involved in most loan inquiries and of the
                            importance of promptness in replying to them in order that important
                            operations of American bankers be not subjected to the delay often
                            incident to Governmental procedure.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>(3) It will be advisable to bring to the attention of Commercial Attaches
                            or Trade Commissioners the policies herein set forth, particularly in
                            the event of negotiations for a Government loan. American officials of
                            Departments other than the Department of State should act in any
                            relations with foreign officials only with the full knowledge and
                            approval of the diplomatic officer in charge of the mission.</p>

                                submission of the Paraguayan-Bolivian boundary question to the
                                Government of Argentina, reported in this Mission’s despatch No.
                                238, dated February 3, 1927,<note n="48" xml:id="d240fn48">Not

                            <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs offers the information that this
                                morning he received a telegram from the Paraguayan Minister of
                                Hacienda, Dr. Manuel Benítez, now in Buenos Aires, stating that
                                Bolivia had accepted the good offices of Argentina.</p>
                            <p>He further stated that, under the circumstances, Paraguay would not
                                submit to the United States the note of which he had previously
                                spoken, and of which the Department was informed in this Legation’s
                                telegram No. 15 and its despatch No. 203, both of December 7,

                                not at this time. He is doubtful if Bolivian representatives will
                                appear when the time is set for conference, as upon two former
                                occasions they failed to attend at the agreed time and place.</p>
                            <p>It is possible, however, he said, that Bolivia might make a pretense
                                of desiring the solution of the question, inasmuch as he had been
                                advised that the Bolivian Minister of Foreign Affairs had stated
                                that he would confer with the Argentine Chancellory during the first
                                week in March.</p>
                            <p>If the question can be settled by the good offices of Argentina, all
                                well and good, but if from any cause failure should result, Paraguay
                                    <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0402"/>will immediately ask
                                the United States to solve the difficulty. It is the Minister’s
                                opinion that this will be the outcome in the end.</p>

                                reference is made, that in previous conversations on this subject
                                with the Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs you were careful to
                                avoid any indication or comment as to the possibility that the
                                Government of the United States might be willing to enter into
                                negotiations looking to the settlement of the controversy. The
                                Department assumes that you have consistently maintained this
                                attitude, which has its entire approval. This Government is
                                particularly anxious not to appear in any way to invite a request
                                for its assistance, nor does it wish to predict what its position
                                toward such a request might be. The Department believes that in the
                                circumstances further inquiries on your part might be misunderstood,
                                and therefore desires you to refrain from making them. If the

                                April 22, 1927, a protocol was signed in Buenos Aires by Dr. Alberto

                                Foreign Affairs of Bolivia, and Dr. Lisandro Diaz Leon, the Minister
                                of Paraguay at La Paz, in which Bolivia and Paraguay accept the good
                                offices of Argentina in the matter of the boundary dispute between
                                the two countries.</p>
                            <p>It appears that several years ago, at a time when the
                                Paraguayan-Bolivian relations had reached an acute stage, the
                                Argentine Government tendered its good offices to the nations in
                                question with a view to furthering an amicable settlement of this
                                problem. The signing of the Protocol, therefore, can probably be
                                ascribed to Argentina’s efforts.</p>

                            <p>The Argentine Government will be represented at the Conference by Dr.

                            <p>Upon their arrival at the Foreign Office the delegates were received
                                by Dr. Sagarna, the Minister for Foreign Affairs ad interim. After
                                the exchange of credentials Dr. Sagarna, who presided over the first
                                meeting, welcomed the commissioners in the name of President Alvear
                                and explained that Argentina had extended its good offices in the
                                    <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0405"/>desire that the long

                                to the sovereignty of either nation. Both delegations were then
                                received by President Alvear, to whom they presented their
                                respects.</p>
                            <p>Certain Paraguayan and Bolivian delegates have given interviews to
                                the press, couched in vague but optimistic terms, alleging that
                                their respective delegations are inspired by a spirit of justice and
                                friendship. Dr. Mujía, of the Bolivian Delegation, however, is
                                reported to have stated that his country must have an outlet on the
                                Paraguay River, which should be not only of immense benefit to
                                Bolivian commerce, but of great value to Paraguay. On the other
                                hand, Dr. Guggiari, one of the Paraguayan representatives, has
                                pointed out to <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi> that his country is
                                much more vitally interested than Bolivia in the Northern Chaco and
                                has substantiated its claims repeatedly during the last half century
                                by military occupation, commercial concessions, etc. This interview
                                has called forth a sharp reply from Dr. Escalier, who, in a letter
                                to <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi>, expressed his surprise at Dr.
                                Guggiari’s statements and asserted that the Bolivian delegates could
                                also proclaim the incontestable rights of Bolivia to the Northern
                                Chaco.</p>
                            <p>Among Argentine officials there seems to be slight hope of the
                                Conference reaching a solution of this long outstanding controversy.
                                In Paraguay, so I am informed by the diplomatic representative to
                                Argentina from a neighboring country, who has just returned to
                                Buenos Aires from a visit to Asunción, there is a pronounced feeling
                                of pessimism on the outcome of the Conference, and public opinion is
                                strongly adverse to making any concessions to Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that Article 4 of the Protocol of April 22
                                provides for the formation of an arbitral tribunal should the
                                present Conference fail to reach a definite agreement. In this
                                connection press reports of apparently trustworthy character state
                                that the Argentine Government would decline to accept a membership
                                in any arbitral tribunal that might be formed in pursuance to this
                                Article, and it has been confided to me by a high Government
                                official that President Alvear would not consent to act as
                                arbitrator.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 26
                                of October 3, I have the honor to state that the negotiations of the
                                Paraguayan and Bolivian <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0406"

                                protocol appear to have reached an impasse. It is reported that the
                                cause of the difficulties encountered by these delegations consists
                                in the divergence of opinion on the subject of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> which the Department will remember was defined
                                in the Pinilla-Soler protocol of 1907.<note n="53" xml:id="d244fn53"

                                Paraguayan representatives desire to reach, first of all, some kind
                                of a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> based upon this <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> after which the determination of
                                the international boundary could be arrived at by direct
                                negotiations. Should these fail, an arbitral tribunal would be
                                appointed and the limits of the territory defined that would be
                                submitted to its decision.</p>
                            <p>It is stated, however, that the Bolivians decline to consider at
                                present any such <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> or <hi
                                    rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, asserting that the
                                delimitation of the international boundary must be first considered
                                and not matters of relatively secondary importance. It is also
                                reported that, according to the Bolivian viewpoint, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> of the Pinilla-Soler protocol had
                                no bearing upon the boundary lines which, according to the terms of
                                that protocol, were to be submitted to arbitration and which, the
                                Bolivians allege, were altered by the Mujía-Ayala protocol of
                                    1913.<note n="54" xml:id="d244fn54"><ref target="frus1915#pg_33"

                                The Bolivian delegates also declare that the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >status quo</hi> had reference only to actual possessions and
                                not to boundaries.</p>
                            <p>To the observation of the Paraguayan delegates that Bolivia has
                                erected forts to the eastward of the line stipulated in the
                                Pinilla-Soler protocol, their Bolivian confreres reply that Paraguay
                                has also made important advances into the disputed territory.</p>
                            <p>It is alleged in this connection, however, that should the Paraguayan
                                thesis be adopted, it would not mean that Bolivia would be
                                compelled, for this reason, to evacuate the forts, as such
                                evacuation would occur only in the event that the treaty or arbitral
                                decision gave the territory to Paraguay. It would, however, be
                                equivalent to a recognition by the Bolivians that their occupation
                                of this country was merely <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> and not
                                    <hi rend="italic">de jure.</hi></p>
                            <p>During October and November the delegations have held a number of
                                plenary sessions for the purpose of presenting various memoranda and
                                counter memoranda setting forth their views with respect to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi>. These memoranda are now being
                                studied by a special committee appointed for this purpose. This
                                committee is composed of the following persons:</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Plenipotentiaries, Doctors José María Escalier and
                                Daniel Sánchez Bustamante.</p>
                            <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0407"/>
                            <p>The Paraguayan Plenipotentiaries, Doctors Eusebio Ayala, José P.
                                Guggiari and Fulgencio R. Moreno, together with several technical
                                advisers.</p>
                            <p>It will also examine the problems presented by the delimitation of
                                the frontier and the possible establishment of an arbitral tribunal.
                                For the time being, therefore, the plenary sessions of the
                                delegations have been suspended.</p>
                            <p>It is stated that but slight hopes are entertained of solving the
                                difficulty in question, although Dr. Ayala expressed himself in
                                optimistic terms on the occasion of a recent visit to Asunción.
                                Should the direct negotiations terminate in failure, the appointment
                                of an arbitral tribunal, as provided in Article IV of the
                                Gutierrez-Diaz León protocol, would appear to be the next step to be
                                taken by both Governments.</p>

                            <p>109. A report that the Government of Argentina had offered its
                                mediation to settle the boundary dispute between Bolivia and
                                Paraguay has been given prominence in <hi rend="italic">La
                                    Nación</hi>. The Foreign Minister has denied in the paper that
                                the Government of Argentina had offered mediation.</p>
                            <p>I have ascertained from a reliable source that about a week ago the
                                Government of Argentina instructed its diplomatic representatives at
                                Asunción and La Paz to inform the Governments to which they are
                                accredited in the following sense: An impasse having apparently been
                                reached in the negotiations between the Governments of Bolivia and
                                Paraguay to settle the long-standing boundary dispute, the
                                Government of Argentina deemed it important to settle the matter
                                before the Pan American Conference opened next month. As an evidence
                                of its friendly and neighborly sentiments and since the meetings of
                                the Joint Commission were being held in Buenos Aires, the Government
                                of Argentina made the suggestion that an agreement be reached
                                between the two parties along the following lines: <list>

                                    <item>That the matter be submitted to definite

                                    <item>That police forces be substituted for military forces in
                                        the small regiments in the territory in dispute and along

                                    <item>That a nonaggression pact effective until the disputed

                            <p>Bolivia answered that it gladly accepted Argentina’s offer of
                                mediation, and Argentina replied that it had not offered to act as
                                mediator, would not accept [a request?] to arbitrate, and had only
                                suggested a logical and final way out of the present difficulty.
                                Paraguay answered that it accepted the Argentine suggestion in
                                principle.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the
                                Department that the Paraguayan and Bolivian Boundary Commissions,
                                which have been attempting, without success, to settle the boundary
                                dispute between their respective countries, adopted yesterday a
                                resolution, which was immediately made public. A translation of this
                                resolution reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“As the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay have accepted, in
                                        principle, the friendly suggestion of the Government of the
                                        Argentine Republic, as a means whereby the plenipotentiaries
                                        of the Boundary Conference who have met in this Capital may
                                        be enabled to continue their task, in view of the lateness
                                        of the season and the advisability for both delegations to
                                        place themselves in contact with their respective
                                        Chancelleries, it is resolved: To suspend the Conference
                                        until March 15, 1928.”</p>

                                    Between Colombia and Nicaragua</hi></p>
                            <p>The Colombian Minister called on Monday, August 1, at my request. I
                                told him that in the course of the last three or four years when we
                                were discussing together the settlement of the boundary between
                                Colombia and Panama and the boundaries between Colombia and Peru and
                                Colombia and Brazil he had said that when these were finished
                                Colombia would have but one outstanding territorial question,
                                namely, that with Nicaragua which he would like to have settled here
                                also. I told him that the Department had now received a telegram
                                from the Legation in Nicaragua, stating that the Colombian Minister
                                had just returned to Managua and had said that he expects to reopen
                                this question with the Nicaraguan Government. The matter had been
                                discussed between President Diaz and the American Minister and it
                                seemed possible that Nicaragua might request the views of this
                                Government regarding the matter.</p>
                            <p>I reminded the Minister that some two years ago the question had come
                                up and that Colombia had then suggested a settlement by which
                                Colombia would withdraw her claim and would recognize Nicaraguan
                                sovereignty over the Mosquito Coast and Great and Little Corn
                                Islands if Nicaragua, in return, would recognize Colombian
                                sovereignty over the Islands of San Andrés and Providencia.
                                Nicaragua had declined such a settlement and had stated in return
                                that Nicaragua could not discuss the Mosquito Coast nor Great and
                                Little Corn Islands, which must be recognized as Nicaraguan, but
                                would be willing to arbitrate the question of San Andrés and
                                Providencia. So far as I knew, this matter had not progressed
                                further, but I presumed this had not been accepted by Colombia as
                                Colombia was now opening the matter further.</p>
                            <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0410"/>
                            <p>Señor Olaya replied that this had been rejected; that Colombia could
                                not arbitrate only a portion of the claims, that either the full
                                claims of both would have to be arbitrated or there would have to be
                                some outside settlement and Colombia really did not want to
                                arbitrate the question of the San Andrés Islands. Besides holding
                                valid titles to these Islands from Spain, these Islands were
                                inhabited and had been administered by Colombia for the last 125
                                years. Hence Colombia would not wish to arbitrate giving them up,
                                but Colombia he thought would be willing to make the same
                                arrangement as proposed two years ago. I told the Minister that it
                                might be possible for this Government to be of some help in the
                                matter and, as he knew, the Department was always glad to be of
                                assistance, at the request of both parties, to the Republics of this
                                hemisphere in settling their difficulties. There was also a question
                                in which the United States was also involved and before going
                                further in the matter I would like to know whether Colombia regarded
                                Roncador Key, Quita Sueño Bank, and the Serrana Bank as part of San
                                Andrés Archipelago. The Minister would recall that President Wilson
                                had issued proclamations in 1919<note n="58" xml:id="d248fn58"><ref

                                possessions of the United States by virtue of the so-called Guano

                                    11 Stat. 119.</note> During the last year, when I was away from
                                the Department, the question had come up in connection with some
                                British seamen, I thought, and I felt it would be well to have it
                                definitely settled that these Islands were not a part of the San
                                Andrés Archipelago.</p>
                            <p>The Minister replied that this was a matter in which there was a
                                difference of opinion; that the Islands were practically worthless.
                                Part of the year they are completely submerged and the rest of the
                                year are used by fishermen and also have some slight value on
                                account of guano deposits. The Islands are a danger to navigation,
                                especially when submerged and that he presumed the main interest of
                                the United States in the Islands was on account of the danger to
                                shipping and the necessity of maintaining lighthouses there.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that he was without instructions from his
                                Government, that he had studied the matter very closely and he would
                                like to make a personal suggestion which, if acceptable, he would
                                recommend to his Government:</p>
                            <p>Colombia and Nicaragua to conclude a treaty by which Nicaraguan
                                sovereignty is recognized over the Mosquito Coast and Great and
                                Little Corn Island[s] and Colombia would also in the same act
                                confirm the rights of the United States to Great and Little Corn
                                Islands obtained by the Treaty with Nicaragua of 1914.<note n="60"

                                to sell these keys to the United States, should the United States so
                                desire, for a consideration to be agreed upon between the two
                                Governments.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that it was a question of <hi rend="italic">amour
                                    propre</hi> for Colombia as she could not well give up the
                                Islands or recognize American jurisdiction over them except through
                                arbitration and that he felt sure that Colombia would accept anybody
                                proposed by the United States as arbitrator. I told the Minister I
                                would look into the matter and advise him later.</p>

                                    Settlement of Territorial Question Between Colombia and
                                    Nicaragua</hi></p>
                            <p>The Colombian Minister called on Tuesday, August 2, and said that he
                                had been thinking over the question of the Colombian-Nicaraguan
                                territorial dispute as well as the question of Roncador, Quita
                                Sueño, and Serranilla keys, and that he had jotted down three
                                possible formulas for settling the matter. He read these over to me
                                and left a copy thereof which is attached hereto.<note n="61"
                                    xml:id="d249fn61">Memorandum <hi rend="italic"
                                    >infra.</hi></note> The Minister stated that he thought that
                                perhaps the third was the most acceptable.</p>
                            <p>When the Minister first came in he stated that he had thought up four
                                solutions, although his memorandum contained but three. I therefore
                                told him that while I had not yet been able to study the matter
                                fully as some of the papers were in rather inaccessible archives and
                                I had not yet been able to get hold of them, I had nevertheless read
                                certain of the papers and it appeared to me that we were making a
                                great deal out of a very small matter. These keys had been claimed
                                by the United States since about 1869 and the President had issued a
                                proclamation in 1919 formally declaring them to be under the sole
                                and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and out of the
                                jurisdiction of any other Government. Furthermore, these keys
                                appeared to have very little intrinsic value; that they do
                                constitute a very real menace to shipping, lying as they do on the
                                trade route between the Panama Canal and the Straits of Yucatan. <pb
                                    n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0412"/>That being the case, the
                                United States had erected lighthouses on them and maintains them and
                                far from the Islands bringing in any revenue to the United States
                                they constitute an expense to the extent of the erection and
                                maintenance of the lighthouses, and that these lighthouses are
                                maintained for the benefit of everyone, Colombian shipping as well
                                as that of the United States and all other maritime nations. In view
                                of this fact, I thought that the easiest solution would lie in a
                                general recognition all around of the <hi rend="italic">statu
                                    quo</hi>, that is, for Nicaragua to recognize Colombian dominion
                                over San Andrés and Providencia, Colombia to recognize Nicaraguan
                                dominion over the Mosquito Coast and the Corn Islands and the United
                                States dominion over these keys.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that Colombia could justify recognizing certain
                                territorial rights to Nicaragua because Nicaragua recognized
                                Colombian rights in return over San Andrés and Providencia, but in
                                the case of these keys the United States was not recognizing
                                anything as Colombia’s in return. He then alluded to the fact that
                                the inhabitants of San Andrés now fish in the waters off these keys
                                and will probably wish to continue to do so. I then suggested to him
                                that that would give the United States the chance to recognize the
                                    <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> in favor of Colombia by
                                according the inhabitants of San Andrés the right to fish in the
                                waters of these keys. …</p>
                            <p>The Colombian Minister stated that he had not ventured to put in
                                writing a further solution that suggested itself to him as he was
                                without instructions from his Government. I told him that I quite
                                appreciated his position and fully understood that any suggested
                                formula that he might make to me was purely personal and informal on
                                his part without instructions from his Government and was not
                                binding in any way. He then said that somewhat over a year ago
                                Colombia had arrested certain British fishermen in these waters and
                                that the British Government told the Colombian Government that it
                                did not recognize the right of the latter to make the arrest in
                                these waters as the ownership of these Islands was in dispute
                                between Colombia and the United States, and had added that, should
                                Colombia not have jurisdiction in those waters, Great Britain
                                reserved the right to make claims for indemnity for the improper
                                arrest. The Minister stated that they of course would not like to be
                                met with demands from the British Government for indemnity of a
                                million pesos or so for every West Indian Negro fisherman arrested
                                at that time, but he agreed with me that it was advisable to settle
                                the matter without too cumbersome a process and was inclined to
                                agree with the views I stated earlier in our conversation to the
                                effect that the Islands were hardly of sufficient importance to
                                justify the expense of an arbitration. Also he stated <pb n="327"
                                    xml:id="pg_327" facs="0413"/>that he would like to have some <hi
                                    rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> to justify Colombia recognizing
                                these keys as appertaining to the United States and giving up the
                                position they had taken in the past that they belonged to Colombia.
                                The Minister therefore thought that the matter could best be
                                arranged by the signing of a Procès-Verbal by the Secretary of
                                State, the Colombian Minister and the Nicaraguan Minister, in which
                                it would be agreed that Colombia and Nicaragua would sign a treaty
                                by which Colombia would recognize Nicaraguan dominion over the Corn
                                Islands and Mosquito Coast and Nicaragua would recognize Colombian
                                dominion over San Andrès and Providencia, and the United States and
                                Colombia would sign a treaty by which Colombia would renounce her
                                rights to the keys in favor of the United States and recognize the
                                dominion of the United States over those keys, the United States
                                agreeing in turn to grant the inhabitants of San Andrès fishing
                                rights of these waters in perpetuity and also to construct
                                lighthouses on San Andrès and Providencia, the lighthouses
                                thereafter to be maintained by Colombia.</p>
                            <p>I told the Minister that I thought this was a very good suggestion
                                which I, personally, was inclined to favor, and he stated that he
                                would recommend it to his Government and let me know as soon as he
                                had a reply.</p>
                            <p>It will be recalled that when the United States established
                                lighthouses on the three keys in question, the Navy Department and
                                the Department of Commerce were both very anxious to establish
                                lighthouses on San Andrés and Providencia and asked the Department
                                to take the matter up with the Colombian Government. The Department
                                replied that these Islands were in dispute between Colombia and
                                Nicaragua and that the Department believed that, pending the
                                adjustment of the dispute between Colombia and Nicaragua regarding
                                the Islands mentioned, it would be inadvisable to take any action
                                with a view to obtaining permission for the erection of aids to
                                navigation upon those Islands. The Department later on did request
                                the permission of the Colombian Government but never received an
                                answer. At that time the ratification by Colombia of the Treaty of
                                1914 for the settlement of differences regarding the independence of

                                and also the matter was complicated by a press campaign in Bogota
                                against the United States on account of its action in erecting
                                lighthouses, without consulting Colombia, on the Roncador, Quita
                                Sueño and Serranilla keys, which were claimed by Colombia. The
                                solution proposed appears eminently satisfactory to the United
                                States as it settles another Latin American territorial conflict and
                                clears up any question as to the right of Nicaragua in 1914 to lease
                                Great and Little Corn Islands <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328"
                                    facs="0414"/>to the United States. It also settles in favor of
                                the United States our claims over these keys and furthermore we get
                                permission to construct the two other lighthouses which the Navy and
                                Commerce Departments consider necessary for the safety of navigation
                                in those waters.</p>

                                by means of an arbitration convention between the two Governments.
                                In these notes the parties can make such statements as they deem
                                opportune which are to be incorporated afterwards in an arbitration

                                the Department to refer to in connection with my telegram No. 181 of
                                July 28, 4 P.M., I have the honor to advise the Department that I
                                have nevertheless discussed this entire question informally with
                                President Diaz and intimated that I saw no reason why preliminary
                                negotiations with the Colombian Minister should not be undertaken. I
                                am informed that this has been done. I hope my action in the matter
                                will have the approval of the Department. It would, however, be
                                appreciated by both President Diaz and this Legation if the
                                Department would indicate whether a settlement along the lines

                                    Chargé’s despatch No. 515, Oct. 25, 1927 (not printed).</note>
                                Department’s telegram October 6, 6 p.m. The Colombian Minister has
                                proposed a settlement leaving the San Andrés Archipelago to Colombia
                                and the Corn Islands and the Mosquito Coast to Nicaragua. The
                                Nicaraguan Government apparently regards this proposal with some
                                favor but wishes to do nothing until it hears from the Department.
                                The delay is prejudicial to the chances of a settlement because the
                                prolonged discussion of the matter by the newspapers and by the
                                bipartisan advisory commission, which the Government has appointed,
                                can only do harm.</p>

                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me today that he had been
                                privately informed by a Nicaraguan in Bogotá that the Colombian
                                Government might be persuaded to pay an indemnity of $500,000 for
                                the relinquishment of Nicaragua’s claim to the San Andrés
                                Archipelago if a Nicaraguan Minister were sent to Bogota to discuss
                                the matter. I endeavored to discourage this idea.</p>

                                positively the treaty would be acted upon by Congress in the early

                                on account of the repeated disappointments in this respect Lozano
                                feels that no action will be taken in which case he states there
                                will be no occasion for him to remain longer as Minister in Peru and
                                that he fears a serious rupture in the relations of the two

                            <p>4. President Leguía told the Colombian Minister that, due to the
                                delicate situation occasioned by the Tacna-Arica question, he would
                                be unable to submit the boundary treaty to the present Congress. The
                                Colombian Minister replied that, because of reiterated promises made
                                by the President and the Foreign Office on various specific
                                occasions during the last few years and especially during the last
                                few months that the treaty would be submitted to Congress and
                                promptly ratified and the fact that they had failed to fulfill any
                                of these promises, he considered it useless to negotiate further on
                                this subject with the Government of Peru and he would not return
                                again to discuss the subject with him.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>The Colombian Minister also told President Leguía that if the treaty
                                were not submitted and approved by this Congress, a dangerous
                                condition of public opinion in Colombia would be created. President
                                Leguía seemed greatly embarrassed and assured the Colombian Minister
                                that the present state of affairs was due to circumstances beyond
                                his control. He begged him to be patient, and again assured him that
                                his intention to have the treaty ratified at some future date was as
                                strong as ever. The Colombian Minister appears to have little
                                confidence in this and has informed his Government of the present
                                state of affairs.</p>

                                    of</hi> 1922</p>
                            <p>The Colombian Minister called on Mr. White on June 15 and stated that
                                his Government is very anxious regarding the ratification of the
                                Colombian-Peruvian Boundary Treaty of 1922 and, as the Department
                                had been most helpful in this matter in the past and especially with
                                relation to the signing of the Procès Verbal on March 4, 1925, he
                                would be very glad to know the Department’s views in the matter and
                                any suggestions it might have to offer. The Minister stated that he
                                had received a cable from his Government three or four days ago
                                stating that word had been received from the Colombian Minister in
                                Lima to the effect that the President of Peru had discussed the
                                matter recently with Ambassador Poindexter and had assured him that
                                Peru would ratify the Colombian Treaty during the coming session of
                                the Peruvian Congress.</p>
                            <p>Mr. White told the Minister that so far the Department had received
                                no report from Lima regarding this phase of the matter but, as the
                                Minister’s information apparently had been sent from Lima to Bogota
                                by cable and from there to Washington also by cable, there had
                                evidently been a recent development about which there had not been
                                time to receive a report from the American Ambassador in Lima. The
                                last report that Mr. White had seen stated that there had been no
                                chance of the ratification of this Treaty during the last session of
                                Congress and that, had the matter been brought to a vote,
                                ratification would surely have been rejected. The indications,
                                however, pointed to a more favorable situation since then and Mr.
                                White could only suggest patience to the Colombian Minister.</p>
                            <p>Doctor Olaya referred to the unfavorable effect the delay had caused
                                in Colombia and said that he understood the situation and agreed
                                that it would be well to await further reports to know more
                                definitely what recent developments had taken place in Peru. Doctor
                                Olaya asked Mr. White to keep the matter in mind and, should it be
                                possible to do anything, expressed the hope that the Department
                                would continue to use its good offices. Mr. White stated that the
                                Department would of course be glad at any time to be helpful to the
                                nations of this hemisphere in arranging their difficulties and would
                                watch developments in this case with great interest.</p>

                                the Colombian Minister in Peru, again expressed to me his conviction
                                that the Government of Peru was playing for time in the matter of
                                ratifying the Colombian-Peruvian treaty.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>The Government of Colombia, Dr. Lozano states, considers that matters
                                have reached the point where further delay cannot be countenanced,
                                and that unless Parliament acts on the treaty within the next 20
                                days, he will depart from Peru. Dr. Lozano earnestly requested me to
                                speak to the Foreign Minister and the President to urge
                                ratification. It is my feeling at this time that evidence of the
                                interest of the United States would further action, and unless the
                                Department instructs me otherwise, I intend to mention the subject
                                to the Foreign Minister Saturday, September 10, and inquire as to
                                progress and stress the importance of prompt action in the interest
                                of good relations between Colombia and Peru. I believe that a call
                                on the President would be far more likely to produce results, but
                                will not take this step unless the Department instructs me to do
                                so.</p>

                            <p>28. Embassy’s number 39, September 7, 8 p.m. The Department today
                                discussed the ratification of the Colombian treaty with the Peruvian
                                Ambassador and manifested to him the interest of this Government in
                                the matter and the hope that this question would now be finally
                                disposed of. He said he would cable his Government immediately. You
                                may take up the matter with the Foreign Minister and, at your
                                discretion, with the President, should you have a favorable

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my
                                telegram No. 39 of September 7, 8 p.m., and the Department’s
                                telegram No. 28, September 9, 7 p.m., regarding the ratification of
                                the Peruvian-Colombian Boundary Treaty.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to report that after receiving the Department’s No.
                                28, above referred to, I called upon the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs and after discussing several other matters with him,
                                inquired regarding the progress being made toward ratification of
                                the boundary treaty with Colombia, stating that I had heard that the
                                delay in ratification was causing some uneasiness in Colombia and
                                that of course the Government of the United States took a friendly
                                interest in furthering the continuance of amicable relations between
                                these two important countries of South America.</p>
                            <p>Señor Rada y Gamio immediately entered into a long explanation of the
                                causes for the delay in the ratification of the treaty. He first
                                alleged that the delay was not as great as the Colombians seemed to
                                think, inasmuch as the period during which ratification could have
                                been effected began only on March 4, 1925, when the final agreement
                                relative to the treaty was signed in Washington. He then said that
                                it had not been deemed advisable to present the treaty for
                                ratification last year as it had been felt at that time that such
                                action would have resulted in the Congress either rejecting the
                                treaty or demanding its modifications. Either contingency, he
                                pointed out, would have been most unwelcome to the Government and it
                                was thought that the only course to be pursued was to withhold
                                presentation of the treaty until the way to its certain ratification
                                had been paved by the Government.</p>
                            <p>Señor Rada y Gamio assured me that every obstacle to the presentation
                                of the treaty to the Parliament and its ratification had now been
                                removed. He said that it had been necessary to go rather slowly with
                                the Senators and Deputies because of their well known
                                susceptibilities, that if they felt the Government was trying to
                                hustle the members of the Foreign Relations Committee of the
                                Parliament into a hasty recommendation of the treaty, or was trying
                                to hustle the Parliament itself into a hasty ratification, they
                                might easily become antagonistic. He added that acrimonious comment
                                in the newspapers and the Parliament of Colombia and the obvious
                                impatience of the Colombian Government did not help matters when it
                                came to ratification here, that the main basis for asking for
                                ratification of this treaty lay in advancing the theory of
                                Peruvian-Colombian friendship and that every act of Colombia, or
                                even of individual Colombians, <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"
                                    facs="0423"/>which could be used to show that Colombian
                                friendship was not sincere, made it more difficult to obtain
                                favorable action from the Peruvian Parliament.</p>
                            <p>After our conversation at the Foreign Office, the Minister of Foreign
                                Relations asked me to accompany him to his house in order that he
                                might show me the extensive work which he had done himself in
                                connection with the Treaty. As we were leaving the Foreign Office
                                building, he called one of his two confidential assistants from his
                                office … This gentleman … said that the documents on which they had
                                been working up to two o’clock in the morning for several days past,
                                were now almost ready and that within a few days they would be in
                                the hands of the Committee.</p>
                            <p>At his house Señor Rada y Gamio showed me a file of manuscript notes
                                which he had made in connection with his defense of the treaty in
                                the Parliament, as well as a series of very rough maps of the
                                district which he had drawn, and several large and fairly detailed
                                maps which he had had made. It was apparently his object to show me
                                that the preparations for submitting the treaty to the Parliament
                                had necessarily been complicated and lengthy and had required a
                                great deal of work on his part. He said, however, that he expected
                                the treaty would be ratified in the course of the month of October,
                                as the Government expected to see it presented for ratification at
                                the end of this month or the beginning of next month and that he did
                                not think that the actual debates of the Parliament would take more
                                than five or six days.</p>
                            <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs asked me to return to see him on
                                Monday, September 12th. When I returned to his office on that day,
                                he told me that he had spoken of the matter of the ratification of
                                the Treaty to the President and that the President had asked him to
                                assure me that the Treaty would be presented to the Parliament at
                                the end of September or the beginning of October, and would be
                                ratified in the course of October. Señor Rada y Gamio added that
                                therefore the United States Government could rest assured that this
                                would be the case since we had the President’s assurances, as well
                                as his own, that the Treaty would “be ratified in the month of
                                October.”</p>
                            <p>Yesterday I had occasion to see the Colombian Minister and in the
                                course of a conversation with him, told him that the Foreign
                                Minister had informed me that the Treaty would be ratified during
                                October. I pointed out to him that the impatience of public
                                statements and newspaper articles in Colombia might be used by the
                                enemies of the treaty in the Parliament here to seek to justify
                                further delay and to oppose ratification on the grounds that a
                                Parliament could not be pressed into ratification by public
                                utterances and press heckling from another country. Señor Lozano
                                agreed with me in this and said that he would telegraph to his
                                Government, recommending <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0424"
                                />that every effort be made to prevent either the Parliament or the
                                press from giving vent to their impatience until the end of October.
                                He said nothing further about leaving Lima in the near future and I
                                inferred from what he did say that he intended to refrain from
                                pressing the matter very urgently upon the Peruvian Government until
                                the end of next month and that he did not now expect to leave Lima
                                before that time.</p>
                            <p>It may be noted that since my telegram, No. 39, above referred to,
                                the Committee for Foreign Affairs has met again but that no business
                                was transacted as the senior Deputy present objected that a quorum
                                of the members of the Chamber of Deputies, who form a part of the
                                Committee, was not present. It may be noted that there was a quorum
                                present of the Committee itself because, although three out of five
                                members appointed from the Chamber of Deputies were absent, the full
                                number of Senators was present. I understand that the Committee is
                                to meet within a few days, but that it is prevented from meeting
                                immediately because Deputy MacLean has gone to spend a few days near
                                lea for the sake of his health, and until he returns there is not
                                likely to be a possibility of having a quorum of the Committee,
                                since it is apparent that the Committee holds that a majority of the
                                Deputies and a majority of the Senators, who are members of the
                                Committee, must be present.</p>
                            <p>While it is my impression that the Peruvian Government is taking more
                                active steps toward ratification at the present time than it has
                                done heretofore, I believe that things are likely to drag on as they
                                have in the past, in spite of the assurances which I have reported
                                above, unless it is made clear to the Peruvian Government that the
                                United States Government understands that they have given a very
                                definite undertaking to have the treaty presented at the latest in
                                the early part of October and ratified in the course of that month.

                            <p>The Ecuadoran Chargé d’Affaires called on Monday, September 26, and
                                stated that he wished to discuss with me the question of the
                                Colombian-Peruvian Boundary Treaty which we had discussed nearly two
                                years ago. The Ecuadoran Government, he stated, was very much upset
                                by the Associated Press report which is being published throughout
                                Latin America to the effect that the United States <pb n="339"
                                    xml:id="pg_339" facs="0425"/>is urging Peru to ratify the
                                Colombian-Peruvian Boundary Treaty. Ecuador was very much upset by
                                this secret treaty, the terms of which Colombia had refused to
                                communicate to her. Ecuador considered that it was contrary to her
                                interests and was contrary to the spirit of their 1916 Boundary
                                    Treaty.<note n="76" xml:id="d266fn76"><hi rend="italic">British

                                a confidential memorandum which was sent out by the Ecuadoran
                                Foreign Office to its Legations abroad,<note n="77"
                                    xml:id="d266fn77">Not printed.</note> explaining the Ecuadoran
                                point of view and the reasons prompting it to break off diplomatic
                                relations with Colombia.</p>
                            <p>I told Señor Barberis that I had not seen the press report he
                                referred to but that it was not authorized by this Department;
                                nothing had been given out by it. I inquired if he knew from where
                                the report emanated—he said he did not but presumed either from
                                Washington, Lima or Bogota.</p>
                            <p>After reading through the memorandum I told him that I could not see
                                that it altered in any way the situation since we had discussed the
                                matter over a year ago. I told him that my recollection of the
                                matter was that Ecuador and Colombia had executed a Boundary Treaty
                                in 1916, by which certain territory in the region of Putumayo River
                                was recognized by Ecuador as Colombian and that Colombia in 1922 had
                                signed a Treaty with Peru giving this territory to the latter. In
                                other words, Colombia in 1922 had given to Peru territory which
                                Ecuador in the Treaty of 1916 had recognized as Colombian. I told
                                him I could see no ground for charging Colombia with violating the
                                treaty provisions in this transaction unless there was something in
                                connection with the 1916 Treaty of which I was not informed. I told
                                him that on the face of it, it would appear to be similar to our
                                ownership of Alaska. Alaska had been sold to the United States by
                                    Russia<note n="78" xml:id="d266fn78">By the convention signed at

                                    p. 388.</note> and if the United States should now wish to sell
                                or cede Alaska to Canada it would appear to be a matter between the
                                United States and Canada, and a matter to which Russia could not
                                object. The same would appear to apply to the territory which
                                Colombia had now ceded to Peru. Señor Barberis referred back to the

                                preceding the conclusion of the Treaty <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340"

                                that the previous treaties had been superseded by the Treaty of 1916
                                and that I was not informed, of course, regarding the minutes of
                                negotiations of the 1916 Treaty. However, the memorandum he had
                                handed me itself appeared to admit that Colombia had not violated
                                any treaty provisions and was legally entitled to conclude the
                                Peruvian Treaty of 1922, ceding this territory to Peru; the
                                memorandum mentioned only a moral obligation on Colombia.</p>
                            <p>The Chargé admitted that that was the case; that Colombia had not
                                violated any treaty provision but that by giving up this territory
                                to Peru Colombia had very seriously prejudiced Ecuador’s position
                                vis-a-vis Peru in the settlement of the Peruvian-Ecuadoran boundary
                                dispute.</p>
                            <p>I told Señor Barberis that I could see the position of Ecuador in the
                                matter and appreciate fully their point of view, but it appeared to
                                me, nevertheless, that here were two different questions and that
                                there was nothing in the Colombian-Peruvian Treaty to prevent
                                Ecuador from immediately attempting to come to an agreement or
                                understanding with Peru over their boundary difficulties. In other
                                words, they were two entirely separate matters the same as the
                                Peruvian-Colombian boundary dispute was entirely different from the
                                Peruvian-Chilean dispute over Tacna-Arica. The Chargé stated that
                                Peru and Ecuador had agreed, as I knew, in 1924 to submit to the
                                arbitration of the United States the points in their boundary
                                litigation on which they were unable to agree.<note n="82"

                                fully understood that and that I presumed in the three years since
                                that agreement had been made Ecuador had been endeavoring to
                                determine upon what points they might come to an agreement with
                                Peru, and that they might well find that they could come to complete
                                agreement and have no matters to submit to a third party. Señor
                                Barberis replied that he did not know the present status of the
                                matter, but it was his understanding that this matter was under
                                discussion. However, he stated, what his Government now wanted was
                                simply for the United States not to make any recommendations to Peru
                                regarding the ratification of this treaty but merely to let it take
                                its course. Ecuador was not asking intervention on the part of the
                                United States in the matter but merely to abstain from taking any
                                action.</p>
                            <p>I replied that this matter was the outgrowth of the Procès-Verbal
                                signed in Washington on March 4, 1925, between Colombia, Peru and
                                Brazil, as the result of good offices of the United States which had
                                been given at the direct request of the three parties concerned. The
                                United States of course could not admit any outside party to <pb
                                    n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0427"/>the discussion unless so
                                requested by all concerned. In other words, it was the policy of the
                                United States to intervene in such matters only when requested to do
                                so by all parties to the dispute. Peru, Colombia and Brazil had
                                asked the United States to lend its good offices and it had done so.
                                Apparently they were the only ones directly concerned in this
                                matter. Ecuador of course felt that its interests were involved on
                                account of its bearing on the other dispute. The United States could
                                take no part in that unless requested by the parties at issue. I
                                explained that this was the policy inevitably followed by this
                                Government and that it had done the same when Bolivia desired to
                                come into the Tacna-Arica negotiations in 1922 and the United States
                                had had to inform them that it could not consent of this unless
                                Chile and Peru should request it. It was the same now in the case
                                between Colombia and Peru.</p>
                            <p>Señor Barberis stated that his Government was not asking to come into
                                the negotiations or asking the intervention of the United States but
                                merely that it abstain from taking any action. I told him that I
                                understood that, but that in many cases to abstain from taking
                                action would have as positive an effect in a given situation as
                                taking direct action and that therefore the United States would be
                                influenced in its attitude only by the request of the parties at
                                issue. Señor Barberis stated that he understood our position but it
                                was a matter of great importance to his country and he would like me
                                to consider it. He stated that he would send me copies of all the
                                treaties between Ecuador and Colombia and also the minutes of the
                                negotiations of the 1916 Treaty. I told him that I should be very
                                glad to consider any matter which he might care to lay before
                                me.</p>

                            <p>55. (1) I have just been asked by the Colombian Minister if I would
                                inquire of the Government of Peru as to the progress of the
                                Colombian-Peruvian boundary treaty, and intimate to it the hope that
                                the treaty would be approved before the Colombian Congress closes on
                                November 17. He thinks that the question is entering upon a decisive
                                phase because the president of the Peruvian Senate, in the name of
                                President Leguía, his brother, promised him that the Committee on
                                Foreign Affairs would report the treaty to Congress day after
                                tomorrow, and that it would be approved by the end of this
                                month.</p>
                            <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0428"/>
                            <p>(2) The treaty appears to be on the eve of being presented to
                                Congress where there is much opposition to it and much agitation
                                regarding it. With the general public the treaty is without doubt
                                unpopular. I have been reliably informed that the president of the
                                House of Deputies in his attempt to convince vacillating members has
                                told them that the Government of the United States has been bringing
                                pressure to bear upon Peru to ratify the treaty. It is my
                                observation that even the officials of the Foreign Office who have
                                assisted the Foreign Minister in preparing the defense of the treaty
                                in Congress bitterly oppose it.</p>
                            <p>(3) Should I make any inquiry now, even if very informally, either of
                                the Foreign Minister or the President, such action might be reported
                                to those opposing the treaty, who as a last resort to arouse public
                                opinion might use my inquiry as evidence that the Government of the
                                United States is endeavoring to force the hand of the Government of
                                Peru. This would react both against the treaty and the United
                                States. The Colombian Minister has told me that Senator Arana
                                telegraphed to Loreto, for publication there, that mass meetings are
                                being held in Lima against the treaty. There have been no such
                                meetings, but the action signifies his intention to incite an
                                uprising there, and the length he is prepared to go. Rather than
                                participate in submitting the treaty to Congress, Senator de la
                                Piedra has taken leave for 20 days; and one of the warmest
                                supporters of the President, Focion Mariategui, is actively opposing
                                the treaty.</p>
                            <p>(4) I intimated to the Colombian Minister that while of course I
                                would be pleased to help him, nevertheless, it seemed to me that the
                                present might not be a propitious time to take the step he
                                suggested.</p>
                            <p>(5) If the treaty is not presented to Congress early next week, a
                                situation might develop where an inquiry might be a decided

                                Department would inform me whether it desires me to make a discreet
                                inquiry despite the possibility set forth in paragraph (3), if there
                                continues to be a delay in presenting the treaty and the President
                                seems inclined to postpone the matter until after the conference at
                                Habana, as some of the Deputies have suggested.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having taken occasion this morning to
                                pay my respects to the Haitian Minister, Mr. Dejean, who returned
                                last evening from Port-au-Prince, I have the honor to report that in
                                a conversation which ensued Mr. Dejean expressed himself as quite
                                optimistic over the prospects of a prompt solution of the
                                Haitian-Dominican boundary question.</p>
                            <p>According to Mr. Dejean, the conversations between President Borno
                                and President Vasquez, as well as between high officials of the
                                respective governments, were very frank and friendly, and it is his
                                belief that for the first time there is the proper disposition on
                                the part of the Dominican Government to effect a solution of this
                                long-standing question. Negotiations will proceed on the basis of
                                the so-called American line, which is the status of present
                                occupation and with a recognition that mutual accommodation will be
                                necessary. The spirit of the Treaty of 1874<note n="87"
                                    xml:id="d274fn87">Jacques Nicolas Léger, <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Recueil des Traite’s et Conventions de la République
                                        d’Haїti</hi> (Port-au-Prince, 1891), p. 119.</note> will be
                                invoked.</p>
                            <p>It is the hope of the Haitian Minister that an agreement will have
                                been reached before the time of the visit of President Borno to this
                                country. He considers it very desirable that the agreement be
                                reached wholly by direct negotiations and the expression of this
                                thought on his part enabled me again to express the interest which
                                the Department has in a friendly solution of the question, and its
                                hope that solution can be achieved through direct negotiations
                                between the two parties. Mr. Dejean stated that in the possible
                                event of arbitration being necessary, appeal would naturally be made
                                to <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0432"/>the American Government,
                                but also frankly observed that he thought the reception of the
                                agreement by certain elements of the Dominican public would be more
                                favorable if American arbitration proved to be unnecessary. He
                                emphasized the value, however, of an occasional expression of
                                interest by the Department of State in an adjustment of this
                                question, and stated that it is his belief that previous expressions
                                of that nature to the Dominican Government had been of considerable
                                assistance in promoting a disposition on their part to find a
                                solution.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dejean will undertake the negotiations with the Dominican
                                Government, and the Legation will be informed of the progress
                                made.</p>

                                boundary question.</p>
                            <p>The question of the Haitian-Dominican frontier was brought up as a
                                subject for discussion between Presidents Borno and Vasquez, during
                                the latter’s recent visit to this Capital. The conversations were
                                friendly and indicative of a mutual desire to arrive at a solution
                                both logical and practical. The two presidents agreed, in principle,
                                to adopt permanently the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> without
                                indemnity of any kind. No definite action was taken, however.</p>
                            <p>One or two minor problems remain to be worked out. One of these is
                                the question of frontier formalities on the trails between the
                                Dominican towns of Banica and Restauracion. These towns are about
                                forty miles apart by the trail usually used by the Dominicans, who
                                find it easier to take this road which crosses a corner of Haitian
                                territory, rather than the road which follows Dominican territory
                                throughout. The journey over this road is approximately five miles
                                shorter than the distance by the road which follows the Artibonite
                                River from Banica as far as La Cruz de Cabrera. The river road is on
                                the Dominican side of the river most of the way. The distance saved
                                is small. On the other hand, the risk of the irritating application
                                of rigid frontier regulations, and the risk of the abuse of the
                                frontier regulations, if they are made lenient, is great.</p>
                            <p>There is a similar rumored frontier problem further south in the
                                vicinity of the town of Pedernales.</p>
                            <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0433"/>
                            <p>President Borno has told me that while nothing of a definite nature
                                was decided upon, it was the opinion of the two presidents that the
                                question of trails could be solved without difficulty and that if
                                necessary an equivalence of land could be exchanged in order that
                                principal trails would not cross the other’s territory. One parcel
                                of territory which would doubtless enter into such a trade, would be
                                that around the eastern extremity of Etang (Lake) Sumatre. It is
                                President Borno’s desire that the frontier should pass between these
                                two lakes so that each country should have a trail around its own
                                lake, without crossing the other’s territory.</p>
                            <p>These adjustments appear to be desirable and satisfactory but it is
                                possible that any talk of exchange of territory will open up a phase
                                of the question which might delay indefinitely a solution to the
                                whole boundary question.</p>

                                respecting the Dominican-Haitian boundary question.</p>
                            <p>During the recent visit of President Vasquez to Port-au-Prince it was
                                suggested by President Borno that a brief convention be signed which
                                should declare (1) that all controversies and questions now existing
                                between the two Governments or which thereafter might arise should
                                be settled if possible through direct and friendly negotiations, and
                                (2) should such direct negotiations prove unsuccessful the good
                                offices of a friendly third power, if proferred, must be
                                accepted.</p>
                            <p>The Convention was not signed, President Vasquez asserting that the
                                death of the wife of Señor Ricart, Dominican Secretary of State for
                                Health and Welfare, impelled him to return at once to Santo Domingo
                                and that he would later accord careful consideration to the matter.
                                Shortly after his return, President Vasquez called at the Haitian
                                Legation to express to the Minister his appreciation of the many
                                courtesies extended to himself and his party during their stay on
                                Haitian territory, and stated that in the near future he would cause
                                to be sent to the Haitian Minister an important communication. When
                                three weeks had passed without any further development, the Haitian
                                Minister addressed a personal and confidential communication to
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs Sanchez in which reference was <pb
                                    n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0434"/>made to the President’s
                                visit to the Legation and his statement regarding the formulation at
                                an early date of an important communication. The Haitian Minister
                                pointed out in his note that he had not as yet received any
                                communication of the nature mentioned by President Vasquez and
                                stated that he would be most happy to receive at an early date, for
                                transmission to his Government, any communication which the
                                Dominican Government might see fit to address to him in the light of
                                the mutual desire of both Governments to effect a friendly
                                settlement of any and all questions pending between the two
                                countries. After some delay Minister Dejean received a note in reply
                                from the Minister of Foreign Affairs saying in substance that the
                                Dominican Government was continuing to accord to the questions its
                                most sympathetic consideration but that for the moment he was unable
                                to amplify that statement.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Minister, doubtless reflecting the attitude of his
                                Government, feels that since Haiti proposed the conclusion of a
                                convention of the nature mentioned above as preparatory to a serious
                                consideration and discussion of the boundary question the next move
                                ought properly and appropriately to come from the Dominicans.</p>
                            <p>In conversation with me last week at his summer home at Las Matas,
                                where in response to his invitation I spent two days, the President
                                told me confidentially that he had recently received a report from
                                Port-au-Prince to the effect that certain differences had arisen
                                between the American High Commissioner and President Borno
                                respecting “certain amendments to the Haitian Constitution,”<note
                                    n="89" xml:id="d276fn89">See <ref target="frus1927v03#pg_48"
                                        >vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>, pp. 48</ref> ff.</note>
                                and that he felt somewhat apprehensive lest the situation might
                                impair President Borno’s energy in dealing with the frontier
                                question. The President stated that he realized fully that an
                                adjustment of the boundary question could only be had if President
                                Borno was in a position to count upon the full support and
                                cooperation of General Russell. He added that he was causing a
                                discreet investigation to be made, and that if his previous
                                information should be confirmed he intended to send a personal
                                message to President Borno counseling him in view of the great
                                importance of the boundary matter to make every effort to procure
                                the full cooperation of the High Commissioner and not permit any
                                other question to impair the fullest cooperation. I stated merely
                                that I had not received any information which would tend in any way
                                to confirm his report. President Vasquez then went on at some
                                length, and in a very earnest and sincere manner, to impress upon me
                                his desire for an early settlement of the question. He said that he
                                regarded the present time as a very opportune one and that if no
                                agreement was reached it would not be because of any lack of desire
                                or earnest effort on the part of the Dominican Government.</p>

                            <p>The Haitian Minister informed me yesterday that he has been asked by
                                President Vasquez to visit him this week and he assumes that the
                                boundary question will be rather fully discussed. The Legation is in
                                close touch with the situation here and will promptly report to the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Adverting to the Legation’s previous
                                despatches respecting the Dominican-Haitian boundary question, I
                                have the honor to submit the following report.</p>
                            <p>As reported in the Legation’s confidential despatch No. 639,
                                September 28, 1927, President Vasquez recently received information
                                indicating that important differences of opinion had arisen at
                                Portau-Prince between the American High Commissioner and President
                                Borno regarding certain proposed amendments to the Haitian
                                Constitution. During my recent visit to the President at Las Matas
                                he expressed some concern over the information he had received,
                                feeling that any important differences between General Russell and
                                President Borno might react unfavorably upon an early settlement of
                                the boundary question.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dejean, the Haitian Minister here, went to Las Matas a few days
                                ago, in response to an invitation from the President, and during the
                                course of the visit President Vasquez inquired of the Minister
                                whether he possessed any information regarding the matter. Dejean
                                assured the President that there was no basis whatever for the
                                report and stated that he had recently received a personal letter
                                from President Borno in which he referred to the proposed
                                constitutional amendments and said that he and General Russell were
                                in accord in the matter. President Vasquez expressed his
                                gratification and stated that a formal communication dealing with an
                                important phase of the relations between the two countries would be
                                addressed to the Minister at an early date.</p>
                            <p>In conversation with me, following his return from Las Matas, Mr.
                                Dejean said that in general he felt optimistic as regards the
                                possibility of effecting in the near future a final settlement of
                                the boundary question. He again expressed the opinion that it would
                                be preferable to conclude the proposed treaty of amity before
                                entering into any formal negotiations respecting the boundary. He
                                suggested <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0436"/>it would be
                                helpful if I continued to manifest a friendly interest in an early
                                and amicable settlement of the controversy. I said that there could
                                be no question but that the Dominican Government fully understood
                                the attitude of the Department and that I should in the future, as I
                                had in the past, in my informal conversations with appropriate
                                Dominican officials impress upon them the friendly interest of my
                                Government in the effecting of a final and definite settlement of
                                the boundary question, an interest which was in entire harmony with
                                that of the two Governments more directly concerned.</p>
                            <p>In reply to an intimation from me that I should be glad to have more
                                definite and exact information with respect to the provisions of the
                                proposed treaty of amity, Dejean said that the draft as submitted to
                                President Vasquez was brief and embraced (1) a declaration outlawing
                                war as between the two countries, (2) a provision stating that in
                                the event friendly negotiations should fail of effecting the
                                settlement of any question between the two Governments, the good
                                offices of a friendly third power, if proferred, must be accepted.
                                With regard to the second provision, Minister Dejean said that it
                                had been suggested here, not however by any Dominican official, that
                                the Dominican Government would construe the reference to the
                                “friendly third power” as in fact meaning the United States, and
                                that if the provision should be changed so as to provide for the
                                submission to the League of Nations of any question not susceptible
                                of settlement by direct negotiations the convention or treaty would
                                find a ready acceptance by the Government here.</p>
                            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Sanchez, together with the other members
                                of the Cabinet, is at Las Matas engaged in the drawing up of the
                                national budget for the coming year. I shall see him so soon as he
                                returns to the Capital and endeavor in a discreet manner to procure
                                full information respecting the Dominican Government’s attitude in
                                the matter of the proposed treaty of amity.</p>
                            <p>The Department will be kept fully informed by despatch or cable of
                                all developments.</p>

                                of the Dominican Government in these matters as outlined to me
                                yesterday by Minister of Foreign Affairs Sanchez.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Haitian proposal looking to the conclusion of a
                                treaty of amity between the two countries, Mr. Sanchez said that the
                                Dominican Government would be unable to sign the treaty in the form
                                in which it had been submitted by President Borno. The principal
                                objection was to the provision under which each Government bound
                                itself to refrain from war against the other. On this point, the
                                Minister expressed himself as being heartily in favor in principle
                                of the provision in question, but asserted that the boundary
                                controversy could be adjusted only through one of three methods, (1)
                                arbitration, (2) direct negotiations, and (3) war. He felt that in
                                view of the past history of the question the Dominican Government
                                could place little hope in any recourse to arbitration, and that if
                                direct negotiations between the two countries should fail, and the
                                use of armed force, precluded, the Dominican Government would find
                                its hands tied. Sanchez asserted that the Dominican Government had
                                in fact no intention of resorting to the use of armed force, but he
                                emphasized the point that under the <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi> the situation is much more favorable to Haiti than to
                                the Dominican Republic, and said that he felt strongly that to
                                outlaw war through the medium of a solemn written undertaking, prior
                                to the settlement of the boundary question, would weaken the
                                position of the Dominican Government in any negotiations with Haiti
                                looking to the definite settlement of the problem.</p>
                            <p>The Minister then went on to say that once the boundary question was
                                settled he would be heartily in favor of the conclusion of the
                                treaty of amity as proposed by President Borno, or, if preferred by
                                Haiti, the text of the provisions of the proposed convention could
                                be made a part of the final treaty settling the boundary
                                question.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sanchez very confidentially informed me that the program of the
                                Dominican Government respecting the settlement of the boundary
                                controversy and the conclusion of a treaty of amity is at present as
                                follows:— <list>

                                        to this point he remarked that the absence of topographical
                                        information, accepted by both Governments, rendered it very
                                        difficult to deal in a satisfactory manner with the frontier
                                        question. He suggested that if the so-called “American Line”
                                        had been definitely established by markers from one coast to
                                        the other it would have been of immeasurable assistance to

                                        Governments in connection with the boundary negotiations. He
                                        added that while both Governments today possessed their own
                                        official maps it was a matter of common knowledge that
                                        neither one was accurate.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>With the necessary topographical data in hand and approved
                                        by both Governments, there should then be, in the opinion of
                                        the Minister, no serious obstacle to the speedy settlement
                                        of the entire question. The Minister intimated that should
                                        the Haitian Government agree to the proposal which the
                                        Dominican Government intends to advance in the near future
                                        looking to the establishment of a topographical commission
                                        the work would probably be done by, or at least under the
                                        supervision of, American experts.</item>

                            <p>In according me the information set forth above Mr. Sanchez requested
                                that it be regarded as highly confidential. I thanked the Minister
                                for the frank expression of his views and the statement of the
                                present attitude and policy of the Dominican Government, and I
                                reiterated the hope that the settlement of the question would
                                continue to receive his most sympathetic and careful attention and a
                                very sincere and earnest effort made to arrive at an early agreement
                                with Haiti.</p>
                            <p>The Minister said that he would be glad to keep me informed of all
                                developments, and that he would wish to confer with me from time to
                                time. He added that he considered it highly important that the
                                Government of the United States be kept promptly and fully apprised
                                of all developments and that he felt that full and frank discussions
                                with me would serve the best interests of both the Dominican
                                Republic and Haiti. In conclusion, he stated that he had not
                                considered it advisable as yet to discuss the entire matter with the
                                Haitian Minister as freely and fully as he had in his conversation
                                with me, but that a communication setting forth the Dominican
                                Government’s attitude toward the proposed treaty of amity would be
                                addressed to Minister Dejean in the near future.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Supplementing the Legation’s previous
                                despatches respecting the Dominican-Haitian boundary question and
                                the conclusion of a suggested treaty of amity, I have the honor to
                                submit the following confidential information with respect to the
                                present status of these matters.</p>
                            <p>The efforts of the Haitian Legation here to effect the conclusion of
                                a convention or treaty of amity of the nature mentioned in my
                                despatch No. 644 of October 5th have thus far proven unsuccessful. I
                                am confidentially informed, however, by the Haitian Minister that in
                                a recent informal conference with the Dominican Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs he inquired whether the Dominican Government would be
                                inclined to enter into the treaty without further delay if there
                                should be eliminated from the present draft the provision to the
                                effect that if friendly negotiations should fail of effecting the
                                settlement of any question between the two governments, the good
                                offices of a third power, if proferred, must be accepted. Minister
                                Dejaan informs me that the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated
                                that it was his personal opinion that the Dominican Government would
                                be prepared to conclude the treaty without delay with the
                                elimination of the provision mentioned. Minister Sanchez agreed to
                                submit the matter to President Vasquez and to inform Mr. Dejean of
                                the President’s views, but the Haitian Minister has heard nothing
                                further in regard to the matter.</p>
                            <p>From the conversations which I have had with the Haitian Minister and
                                with the Minister of Foreign Affairs it is my opinion that the
                                Dominican Government is not considering suggesting to the Haitian
                                Government any plan whereby the boundary question may be submitted
                                for arbitration to the League of Nations. From the inception of the
                                present negotiations the Legation has of course kept this point
                                carefully in mind and it will continue to do so. Should it at any
                                time appear that there exists any real possibility of such a
                                suggestion being <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0440"/>advanced,
                                the Department will of course be promptly informed by cable.</p>
                            <p>Insofar as the boundary question itself is concerned, there have been
                                no recent developments of interest or importance, and it now seems
                                improbable that any action in the matter will be taken by the
                                Dominican Government prior to the forthcoming visit of President
                                Borno which is now tentatively set for December 6th. In the meantime
                                a committee, composed principally of prominent lawyers, which was
                                informally appointed by President Vasquez to study the whole
                                question of the frontier problem is continuing its studies. I was
                                informed today that the committee has about completed its work and
                                that its report will be in the hands of the President within a few
                                days.</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Dominican Nationalist Party recently

                                protesting against the institution of any negotiations respecting
                                the frontier question “so long as the military occupation continues
                                in the neighboring Republic”. In addition, the President of the
                                party recently addressed an open letter to the members of the
                                committee mentioned above contending that the present so-called
                                Haitian Government is illegal and unconstitutional and is therefore
                                incapable of entering into international agreements which would be
                                binding upon the countries concerned. A translation of the letter is

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report with
                                respect to the Haitian-Dominican boundary question that informal
                                conversations, which it is hoped will proceed to a point where
                                formal negotiations can be undertaken with some assurance of
                                success, were instituted in this city on December 28th at a
                                conference in which participated Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                Sanchez, Mr. Troncoso de la Concha, Mr. Jacinto de Castro and Mr.
                                Peyña-Battle, representing the Dominican Government, and Mr. Dejean,
                                the Haitian Minister.</p>
                            <p>At the beginning of the conference a question arose as to whether Mr.
                                Dejean’s participation therein was based on special powers from the
                                Haitian Government to deal with the boundary question or was to be
                                regarded as solely in his capacity as Haitian Minister. Mr. Dejean
                                said that he was without any special powers, and that none <pb
                                    n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0441"/>appeared to be necessary
                                for the present. He then read to the conference extracts from
                                personal letters addressed to him by President Borno which clearly
                                indicated a desire on the part of President Borno that Mr. Dejean
                                during his stay in this country should interest himself primarily in
                                matters pertaining to the boundary question and its settlement.</p>
                            <p>In response to a suggestion which was then made by Mr. Sanchez that
                                the Minister should make a brief statement and embody therein any
                                suggestion which he might care to advance with respect to a
                                desirable mode of procedure, the Minister said that as he viewed the
                                matter it was incumbent upon the Dominican Government to “make the
                                next move”; that he had already acquainted the appropriate officials
                                here with the views of his Government,—viz.: That the <hi
                                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> line “with compensation” should be
                                agreed upon as the basis of any discussions. He explained that by
                                “compensation” he meant that obviously it would be necessary for
                                each Government to cede to the other certain territory. He urged
                                that a serious effort be made to agree upon a boundary line, and
                                strongly recommended that the physical fixation of such line be left
                                to a technical commission. He contended that the work of preparing
                                accurate maps of the frontier zone might well follow rather than
                                precede any efforts to reach an amicable agreement with respect to
                                the line itself.</p>
                            <p>The Dominican representatives pointed out that under the provisions
                                of Article 3 of the Dominican Constitution relative to the
                                non-alienation of Dominican territory the Government might find it
                                necessary to convene a constituent assembly for the purpose of
                                procuring a modification of the article in question prior to the
                                consummation of any agreement with respect to the boundary. In reply
                                to a request for an expression of his opinion in the matter, Mr.
                                Dejean said that the question was of course one for the Dominican
                                Government to determine. He pointed out however that somewhat
                                similar provisions were to be found in the Haitian Constitution and
                                in the treaty of 1915 with the United States.<note n="91"

                                general nature, the conference adjourned to reconvene on Monday,
                                January 2, 1928.</p>
                            <p>Following the conference, I had a rather extended, though entirely
                                personal and unofficial conversation with the Haitian Minister. With
                                respect to the question of the provisions of Article 3 of the
                                Dominican Constitution and their bearing upon the boundary question
                                and the negotiations directed to its adjustment, I suggested as
                                coming entirely from myself, that it would appear to be both wise
                                and expedient to push the negotiations now, and that if the
                                Dominican Government later should hold that an amendment to the
                                constitution was in fact <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0442"
                                />necessary, such action might well follow the conclusion of an
                                agreement <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> between the two
                                countries; that should a constituent assembly be convened to amend
                                the provisions of Article 3, domestic political considerations might
                                induce the Dominican Government to suggest other amendments having
                                no bearing on the boundary question and it might become entangled
                                with domestic political matters. This, I thought, would be most
                                unfortunate. I suggested that the logical order of events in view of
                                the considerations which I had advanced would be (1) agreement on
                                boundary question, (2) constituent assembly, if necessary, to amend
                                provisions of Article 3, (3) ratification of boundary agreement.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Minister agreed fully with my suggestions, and again
                                expressed his appreciation of the interest in the matter which had
                                been taken by this Legation and of our obvious desire in an informal
                                and discreet way to be of all possible assistance.</p>

                        <p>The Bolshevik leaders have had very definite ideas with respect to the
                            role which Mexico and Latin America are to play in their general program
                            of world revolution. They have set up as one of their fundamental tasks
                            the destruction of what they term American Imperialism as a necessary
                            prerequisite to the successful development of the international
                            revolutionary movement in the new world. The propagation of communist
                            ideas and principles in the various countries of Latin America is
                            considered secondary to the carrying on of propaganda against the aims
                            and policies of the United States. Thus Latin America and Mexico are
                            conceived as a base for activity against the United States. Communists
                            in the United States have been repeatedly instructed to devote special
                            attention to the struggle against “American Imperialism” in Latin
                            America and to the organization <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0443"
                            />of resistance to the United States. Bolshevik aims in this respect
                            were succinctly set forth in a resolution of the Third Congress of the
                            Bed International of Trade Unions, July 8–22, 1924, as follows. It was

                            America are summed up admirably in a resolution passed by the Central
                            Executive Committee of the Workers (Communist) Party on November 12,
                            1926. This resolution reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The tasks of our Party at the present time, as set forth in the
                                    resolution of the political committee, are those presented by
                                    the conditions of imperialism. American imperialism is able to
                                    win over large sections of the American workers by sharing with
                                    them <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0448"/>a small part of

                                    fields. However, the steady expansion of American capitalism
                                    upon an imperialist basis is accompanied by the enormous
                                    extension of the vulnerable surface which it presents to attack.
                                    Recent months have furnished striking evidence of the widespread
                                    movement for Latin-American unity against Wall Street. We cite
                                    particularly the present attitude of the Calles Government in
                                    Mexico—its general Latin-Americanism, its policy in Central
                                    America, its tendency toward cooperation with the All-America
                                    Anti-Imperialist League, and the decision of President Calles to
                                    send a personal representative to the Brussels world conference
                                    against imperialism.</p>
                                <p>“The Comintern has repeatedly indicated that a basic task of any
                                    party situated in an imperialist country is to stimulate and
                                    give aid to the nationalist and national revolutionary movements
                                    in the colonial and semi-colonial countries under the heel of
                                    imperialism. This, together with the work among the American
                                    masses, form the basis of our party work. While our party has
                                    made considerable progress in anti-imperialist work, it is still
                                    far from a proper realization of the importance of this work. A
                                    far greater proportion of the party’s resources must be utilized
                                    in anti-imperialist activities. District executive committees
                                    must have standing subcommittees on anti-imperialist activity,
                                    and these must be directed by capable comrades. The party
                                    machinery on a district as well as a national scale must be
                                    drawn into this work.</p>
                                <p>“The anti-imperialist work has been greatly hampered by lack of
                                    sufficient comrades. The party must take measures to create and
                                    train a corps of comrades engaged directly in anti-imperialist
                                    work.</p>
                                <p>“In spite of many handicaps, we have done much to build the
                                    All-America Anti-Imperialist League into an organization engaged
                                    in actual struggle against imperialism. We have carried on
                                    systematic work inside of the Pan-American Federation of Labor
                                    and have achieved some valuable results there. We have
                                    participated in work against United States imperialism in a
                                    number of Latin-American countries, notably Mexico, Porto Rico,
                                    Cuba, Panama and Peru. We have also established some contact
                                    with the Philippine independence movement, altho we have yet to
                                    establish our own nucleus there.</p>
                                <p>“The main task for the period immediaely ahead is the building of
                                    a substantial section of the AAAIL (All-America Anti-Imperialist
                                    League) in the United States itself. This will be accomplished
                                    thru the affiliation of groups organized around specific issues,
                                    such as hands-off-Mexico committees, etc. The Workers
                                    (Communist) Party must remain the central factor in the United
                                    States section of the AAAIL, grouping around itself as closely
                                    as possible other working-class organizations.”</p>

                        <p>In connection with this project you are informed that although the
                            Government of the United States is most hospitable to the consideration
                                <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0453"/>of measures tending to the
                            maintenance of peace and stability in Latin America and insuring a basis
                            for beneficent cooperation it does not consider that the establishment
                            of a Permanent Court of American Justice would be desirable. There would
                            seem to be no reason why a permanent organization of this sort should be
                            established in America to rival the Permanent Court of International
                            Justice at The Hague, and the difficulty of establishing, in view of the
                            relations of the Latin American states, a satisfactory method of
                            selecting the judges of an American Permanent Court would be very great.
                            What would seem to be needed, in order to promote judicial settlement of
                            international controversies in this hemisphere, is an improved plan for
                            arbitral settlements. In this way controversies of which disposition
                            could be more advantageously made by an American tribunal could be
                            referred to a tribunal established for the purpose in accordance with
                            the accepted principles of arbitral procedure. It should be remembered
                            in this connection that the representatives of five of the Latin
                            American Republics, to wit, the Republics of Costa Rica, Guatemala,
                            Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, signed on February 7, 1923, a
                            Convention for the establishment of a Central American tribunal,<note

                            Latin American States. If, therefore, adequate measures are taken to add

                                <p>“Referring to your communication transmitted in the Embassy’s May
                                    12, 3 p.m., and having in mind the evident disposition as
                                    reflected in recent press despatches to attribute unusual
                                    official importance to the statements and proposals of the
                                    American Delegates, the Department does not consider it
                                    practicable or advisable for you to submit to the plenary
                                    session any plan such as the one you have in contemplation. Your
                                    plan has not been submitted and considered here, and from your
                                    statement it would not even be discussed or voted upon by the
                                    Commission of Jurists. The practical result of the proposed
                                    action would be to involve this Government in an implied
                                    commitment in favor of some plan which it has had no opportunity
                                    to examine and pass upon, thereby limiting to a certain degree
                                    its freedom of action at the next Pan American Conference. In
                                    these circumstances you are instructed to refrain from
                                    introducing the plan.”</p>

                        <p>The word “codification” is used in a two-fold sense: strictly, as a
                            statement of the law actually in force; and popularly, as a statement,
                            not merely of the law in force, but such as it should be, in the opinion
                            of those undertaking its formulation and statement. The Delegates of the
                            United States have understood “codification” in its first and strict
                            sense, and the sense in which they believe that the Commission likewise
                            understood it. The projects, therefore, of public international law are
                            in general, it is believed, an acceptable statement of the practice, not
                            only of any one Republic, but of the American Republics, in their
                            relations with one another. Whenever a statement did not seem to be in
                            accord with the law as understood in the United States, the American
                            Delegates called attention to that fact and entered what is called a
                            “reserve”. On one occasion they interposed their reserve to an entire
                            project—that on asylum—on the ground that the practice of receiving
                            political fugitives in a legation or embassy is contrary to the practice
                            of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of the conflict of laws—which the Latin American States
                            universally call “private international law”—the Delegates of the United
                            States entered a general reserve to the entire convention, on the ground
                            that the practice of the United States based, as it is, on domicile, is
                            necessarily so opposed to the practice of those countries accepting the
                            principle of nationality that it was better to refer the projected code
                            of private international law in its entirety to the Department of State,
                            in order that the appropriate authorities of the government might
                            determine the extent to which the United States might be able or willing
                            to accord its approval.<note n="6" xml:id="d288fn6">For text of the

                            provision in any one of the twelve projects of public international law,
                            with the exception of that on asylum, which is contrary to anything <pb
                                n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0457"/>to be found in the projects
                            transmitted by the Pan American Union, and they believe that they did
                            not, at any time during the session of the International Commission of
                            Jurists, make or countenance any proposal which was inconsistent with
                            the provisions, in whole or in part, of the Pan American Union projects,
                            with which the officials of the Department of State are familiar.</p>
                        <p>The International Commission of Jurists for the Codification of
                            International Law, Public and Private, formally opened its proceedings
                            on the evening of April 18, 1927, in the Monroe Palace, in the City of
                            Rio de Janeiro, the incomparable Capital of the United States of
                            Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The Commission owed its immediate origin to a Resolution of the Fifth
                            Conference of the American Republics meeting in Santiago de Chile, in
                            the Spring of 1923, by virtue of which each of the twenty-one American
                            Republics was authorized and requested to appoint two jurists; and the
                            jurists thus appointed were to compose the International Commission
                            which was to meet two years later, in Rio de Janeiro, at a date to be
                            fixed by the Governing Board of the Pan American Union, composed of the
                            diplomatic representatives of the American Republics, which holds its
                            regular monthly sessions in the Pan American Building, in the City of
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>The date finally agreed upon by the Governing Board, in consultation with
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, was April 16, 1927; and two
                            days later, April 18th, the Commission was, in fact, formally opened by
                            His Excellency Octavio Mangabeira, Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the
                            presence of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to Rio de Janeiro, and other
                            leading personalities of the Brazilian Capital.</p>
                        <p>The Commission chose as its President, the Honorable Epitacio Pessôa, an
                            ex-President of the Republic, who had also presided the first Commission
                            of Jurists, which had likewise met in Rio de Janeiro, in the summer of
                            1912. The Brazilian Government appointed as Secretary General the
                            distinguished <hi rend="italic">littérateur</hi>, Mr. Gustavo Barrosa,
                            member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and Correspondent of the

                        <p>Of the twenty-one American Republics, all but Guatemala, Honduras,
                            Nicaragua, and San Salvador [<hi rend="italic">Salvador</hi>], four of
                            the five Republics of Central America, were represented in the
                            Commission. Of the seventeen Republics taking part in the Commission,
                            Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay and
                            Venezuela, were represented by two delegates each, apparently on the
                            theory of one for public, and the other for private international law.
                            Eight of the Republics (Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama,
                            Paraguay, Peru and Santo Domingo [<hi rend="italic">Dominican
                                Republic</hi>]) had but a <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0458"

                        <p>Under a Convention adopted at Rio de Janeiro by the Third Pan American
                            Congress, meeting in that city in 1906, there had been appointed a first
                            Commission for the Codification of International Law, Public and
                            Private. It met in the summer of 1912, in the same city of Rio de
                            Janeiro; and it failed, owing to a lack of preparation. It adjourned
                            within a few weeks after its opening session, never to meet again, due,
                            it is believed, to the outbreak of the World War two years later. The
                            second Commission succeeded because of adequate preparation in advance
                            of its sessions, with some thirty projects of convention dealing with
                            certain phases of public international law, and a complete code of
                            private international law to serve as the bases of discussion; and when
                            the Commission adjourned, on the evening of May 20, 1927, it had twelve
                            draft conventions of public international law to its credit: Fundamental
                            Bases of International Law; States—Existence, Equality and [Recognition;
                            Status of Aliens; Treaties; Exchange of Publications; Interchange of
                            Professors and Students; Diplomatic Agents; Consuls; Maritime
                            Neutrality; Asylum; Obligations of States in Event of Civil War; and
                            Pacific Settlement of International Conflicts; and a complete code of
                            private international law.</p>
                        <p>Within recent years, in Europe, two peace conferences have been held at
                            The Hague, in which certain phases of international law were put in the

                            of approximately two and a half months. In the Second Hague Peace

                            thirteen conventions and one declaration were adopted. This Conference
                            met from June 15th to October 18th—a session of a little over four
                            months. There have been some conferences on private international law
                            likewise held at The Hague, which have put in conventional form some
                            topics on the conflict of laws. But hitherto, there has been no
                            conference in Europe in which international law both public and private
                            has been considered, and the labors of the various Hague Conferences on
                            these two branches of the law do not equal—if the results achieved in
                            private as well as public international law can be considered—the work
                            of the Commission of Jurists meeting in Bio de Janeiro in 1927.</p>

                            of codification by a formal convention of eighteen of the American

                            law through a commission of experts to be composed of a delegate from

                        <p>The Commission itself met in Rio de Janeiro in the summer of 1912, and
                            passed out of existence in the course of the same summer. The procedure
                            to be followed had not been proposed beforehand, and projects for
                            discussion had not been drafted and circulated among the interested
                            Republics in advance of the meeting. When the delegates from seventeen
                            States met, the Brazilian Government laid before them codes of public
                            and private international law prepared respectively by Dr. Epitacio

                            consider the codification of either public or private international law
                            in its entirety. Although the first article of the convention stated
                            that the Commission was to meet, “for the purpose of preparing a draft
                            of a code of private international law and one of public international
                            law, regulating the relations between the nations of America,” the
                            members declared themselves in favor of partial and progressive
                            codification of each of the two branches of international law, and
                            appointed a number of committees to collect information from the
                            American governments, and to prepare reports on the subjects submitted
                            to them for the consideration of the Commission at a later session.</p>
                        <p>The outbreak of the war in Europe in 1914 which affected profoundly the
                            thought of the world and the relations of the American Republics—some of
                            which were eventually drawn into the conflict—put an end to the labors
                            of the first American Commission for the Codification of International
                            Law. However, codification was to be adjourned only for the moment. In
                            the Spring of 1923, some three years after the World War was officially
                            declared to be ended, eighteen of the American Republics met in
                            conference at Santiago de Chile, and in this fifth of the Pan American
                            assemblies, a resolution was voted in favor of reconstituting the
                            International Commission of Jurists, to be composed of two members from
                            each of the American Republics, to meet in Rio de Janeiro, to proceed
                            anew to the codification of public and private international law. The
                            resolution contemplated the partial and progressive codification of
                            public international law, and recommended to the Commission the projects
                            of Mr. Alejandro Alvarez as a basis for discussion.<note n="17"

                            international law, he was anxious that projects of both should be
                            prepared well in advance of the meeting of the Jurists in Rio; that the
                            projects should be drafted by unofficial publicists of repute, and
                            transmitted by the Pan American Union to the various American
                            governments, and by them laid before the International Commission of
                            Jurists, for such consideration as its members should care to give to
                            them. Therefore, Secretary Hughes proposed to the Governing Board of the
                            Pan American Union, at its meeting of January 2, 1924, that the American
                            Institute of International Law be invited to prepare a series of
                            projects on public international law. The motion was unanimously
                            adopted. The American Institute was thereupon invited to prepare the
                            projects. It did so, and on March 2, 1925, Secretary Hughes was able to
                            lay before the Governing Board a series of some thirty projects on
                            timely and important phases of public international law.<note n="18"

                            of promise for the world. We feel that, thanks to American initiative,
                            we are on the threshold of accomplishment in the most important endeavor
                            of the human race to lift itself out of the savagery of strife into the
                            domain of law breathing the spirit of amity and justice.” And he thus
                            concluded his remarks: “I believe that this day, with the submission of
                            concrete proposals which take the question of the development of
                            international law out of mere amiable aspiration, marks a definite step
                            in the progress of civilization and the promotion of peace, and for that
                            reason will long be remembered. For in this effort we are not unmindful
                            of the larger aspects of the question, and it is our hope that the
                            American Republics by taking advantage of this opportunity may make a
                            lasting contribution to the development of universal international
                            law.”</p>
                        <p>The success of the American Institute in framing projects of public
                            international law suggested to Secretary Hughes the feasibility of
                            preparing a code of private international law. He therefore proposed at
                            the same session of the Governing Board of the Pan American Union—the
                            last [at] which he was to preside—that the Executive Committee of the
                            American Institute be invited to prepare “a project or series of
                            projects embodying the principles and rules of private international law
                            for the consideration of the commission of jurists.” <pb n="376"
                                xml:id="pg_376" facs="0462"/>This motion was unanimously adopted by
                            the Board, and a special committee of the American Institute, which had
                            already been appointed by that body at its meeting in Lima in
                            anticipation of such a request, undertook the preparation of the desired
                            code. The distinguished publicist of Cuba, Mr. Antonio Sanchez de
                            Bustamante y Sirvén, laid aside the many important and pressing calls
                            upon his time, to prepare a code of private international law. This was
                            done in the course of a few weeks, approved with slight modifications by
                            the committee of the American Institute at a special meeting in Habana,
                            laid before the Governing Board of the Pan American Union on February 3,

                            Republics to be by them laid before the International Commission of
                            Jurists. Therefore when this body met in Rio de Janeiro on April 16,
                            1927, it found itself in possession of thirty projects of international
                            public law, and a code of private international law of no less than 435
                            articles.</p>
                        <p>The members of the International Commission of Jurists met in Rio de
                            Janeiro under very different conditions from those of its predecessor of
                            1912. It was ready to go to work, and it lost no time in getting to
                            work. In advance of the opening meeting the delegates already in Rio met
                            informally at the residence of Mr. Rodrigo Octavio, the second of the
                            Brazilian delegates, and himself a person of great and deserved
                            distinction in the domain of private international law. Mr. Epitacio
                            Pessôa, who had been President of the first Commission and, in the
                            interval between the two, President of the Republic of Brazil, was also
                            present. This informal and unofficial exchange of views great[ly]
                            facilitated the future labors of the Conference. It was there suggested
                            that Mr. Pessôa should be asked to preside over the Commission; that the
                            rules of the first Commission with sundry modifications and additions
                            should be adopted, and that the Commission should be divided into two
                            sections, to be composed of delegates from all of the Republics
                            represented: Subcommission A, for public international law;
                            Subcommission B, for private international law; that a Subcommission C,
                            of five members, should be appointed to consider the ways and means of
                            continuing the work of codification after the adjournment of the
                            Commission; a Committee D, likewise of five members, for the uniformity
                            of international legislation. These suggestions proposed by Mr. Victor
                            M. Maurtua, delegate of Peru, met with unanimous <pb n="377"
                                xml:id="pg_377" facs="0463"/>approval. It was also suggested by the
                            members present, upon the motion of Mr. Bustamante, delegate of Cuba,
                            that Mr. Maurtua should respond in behalf of the Commission to the
                            address of welcome of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, at the
                            formal opening of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, the 16th of April, had been agreed upon for the opening session
                            of the Commission, but as this was a holiday, and as some of the
                            delegations would not arrive on or before that date, the 18th was
                            proposed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The members of the
                            Commission met in the Monroe Palace at four o’clock of the afternoon of
                            the 16th. The delegations of twelve countries, the quorum required for a
                            regular meeting was present. Mr. Pessôa made a report of the informal
                            suggestions and the proposal was adopted to have the formal opening take
                            place on the evening of the 18th.</p>
                        <p>At five o’clock on the afternoon of Monday, the 18th, the delegates of
                            seventeen American Republics met in the Senate Chamber of the Monroe
                            Palace in a formal, which, however, the official minutes somewhat
                            inaccurately call a preliminary session. The suggestions of the informal
                            meeting of April 14th and of the regular session on the 16th were laid
                            before the members and approved. The proposal of Mr. Pessôa by Mr.
                            Bustamante as temporary President of the Commission was unanimously
                            adopted; the rules of 1912<note n="21" xml:id="d288fn21">For a draft of

                            the Commission into subcommissions was agreed to, as were the
                            appointments of other committees. The appointment by several Republics
                            of a single delegate instead of two, as recommended by the resolution of
                            the Fifth Pan American Conference of Santiago, made it impossible for
                            the two Commissions to meet at one and the same time, as the one
                            delegate would be obliged to attend the session of each of the
                            subcommissions. This cut in half the working hours of each, and laid an
                            undue burden on the single delegates. It operated to the disadvantage of
                            the Subcommission on public international law, as the Subcommission on
                            private international law was to meet in the mornings, and that of
                            public international law in the afternoons, when the Plenary sessions of
                            the Commission were to be held. One or other had to suffer unless the
                            plenary sessions should be in the evenings. This was, however, looked
                            upon with disfavor and, with the exception of the formal opening, the
                            plenary sessions were held in the afternoons at the expense of public
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>Upon the proposal of the delegation of the United States, both members of
                            the various delegations were allowed to register in and <pb n="378"
                                xml:id="pg_378" facs="0464"/>attend both Subcommissions. This
                            enabled them personally to take part in the sessions of the
                            Subcommission of public international law, and, by their presence, to
                            show their interest in the Subcommission of private international law.
                            This is believed to have been the first occasion on which official
                            delegates of the United States attended and took part in an official
                            conference on the conflict of laws, to give private international law
                            the name by which it is generally known in the English-speaking
                            world.</p>
                        <p>At 9 o’clock on the evening of April 18th, the International Commission
                            of Jurists met in plenary and official session. Mr. Pessôa, its
                            temporary President, called the meeting to order and appointed a
                            committee of three to await his Excellency Mr. Mangabeira, the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, and to escort him to the Chair. The
                            Minister appeared and opened the Commission with a gracious and earnest
                            address of welcome, in which he contemplated, indeed, predicted the
                            success of its labors.</p>

                        <p>On behalf of the Commission whose sessions were thus formally opened by
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Maurtua, of Peru, responded in the
                            three-fold character of statesman, jurist, and philosopher. His address
                            is too long to be reported in this place, and it is dangerous to
                            paraphrase in English more than a few of its passages from a Portuguese
                            print of a Spanish original.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of his address, Mr. Maurtua proposed as permanent
                            President, Mr. Epitacio Pessôa, senior Delegate of Brazil, and former
                            President of the Commission of Jurists of 1912. Elected without the
                            formality of a vote, he assumed the Presidency amid the applause of his
                            colleagues, and immediately delivered an excellent and admirably phrased
                            address, so clearly pronouncing his Portuguese that even the foreigners
                            divined its meaning, although they lost here and there a word, a phrase,
                            or even a sentence. The American delegates feel it their duty to
                            reproduce a paragraph or two in the text of this report, although the
                            entire address is given in the appendix.<note n="22" xml:id="d288fn22"

                        <p>This was the atmosphere in which the official delegates of seventeen of
                            the American Republics met, and this was the spirit in which they <pb

                            space of their sojourn in the most attractive, the most hospitable, and
                            the most sympathetic of cities and of countries, in order to give to the
                            Americas the inestimable benefit of a law known in advance, agreed to in
                            conference, and to be interpreted and applied if necessary in tribunals
                            of arbitration and courts of justice.</p>
                        <p>The Commission was now formally opened and ready to enter upon its
                            arduous labors. The Sub-Commission B. on Private International Law met
                            on the morrow at 10 in the morning; the Sub-Commission A. on Public
                            International Law, at 3 in the afternoon, and the process of
                            codification of the two branches began. Committee C. on the Ways and
                            Means of Continuing Codification after the Commission’s adjournment met
                            later, and presented its report. The Commission, and all of its
                            sub-divisions and committees adjourned on Friday, May 20, 1927, with
                            codification in both domains a reality instead of a dream, a hope, an
                            aspiration.</p>
                        <p>What was the nature of the International Commission of Jurists? The
                            Commission was international, in the sense that it was composed of the
                            official representatives of some seventeen independent and sovereign
                            nations. It was continental, in that these nations were part of one and
                            the same continent, and the nations were the free and equal Republics of
                            America. Such was the outward aspect of the Commission. Looked at from
                            within, it was a body of experts in international law, public and
                            private—not a conference of diplomatists vested with political powers by
                            the Republics appointing them, but jurists representing what our Latin
                            American friends and neighbors so happily call the juridical conscience
                            of the Americas. Their purpose was to state international law, public
                            and private, in the form of articles—not to make law as a legislature,
                            or to adopt conventions which, when ratified by the treaty-making Powers
                            of their respective countries would become law for the High Contracting
                            Parties. Their task was humbler, but still honorable: to state in the
                            form of articles, principles of international law and the conflict of
                            laws, to recommend them to the favorable consideration of the Sixth
                            Conference of the Americas, to meet in Habana, January 16, 1928, in
                            order that the diplomatic representatives of the American Republics
                            taking part in that conference might, through the exercise of political
                            power, invest them, in their original or modified form, with the force
                            of conventional law. The diplomatic representatives, acting under
                            instructions from the governments of their respective Republics would
                            bind their countries to the extent of their instructions, and the
                            countries would bind themselves and each to each, by subsequent
                            ratification of the conventions adopted by the Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Commission was therefore a meeting of the jurists possessing the
                            confidence of, and appointed by their respective governments for <pb
                                n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0466"/>the preparation of
                            draft-conventions of public international law, and a code of private
                            international law, to be submitted to the Sixth Conference of the
                            American Republics, for such consideration as the Governments therein
                            represented might care to give to them. The Commission of Jurists could
                            not, therefore, bind the governments which they represented, nor could
                            the Delegation bind the government appointing it. This was evidently the
                            idea of the Conference of Santiago de Chile, which planned the
                            Resolution creating the Commission; it was the conception of the
                            Government of the United States as expressed in the commissions of its
                            Delegates; it was the opinion of all of the Delegates themselves
                            expressed in the first plenary session of the Commission, and at various
                            times in the Sub-Commission.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, manifest that the Governments are not legally bound
                            either by the views expressed by their respective Delegates in the
                            Commission, or in the projects of convention of public law, or code of
                            private law. Their hands are free, but they have before them materials
                            of public and private international law upon and about which they may
                            instruct their diplomatic and therefore political Delegates to the
                            forthcoming Conference of the Americas at Habana.</p>

                        <p>This Sub-Commission, composed at least of one, and in some cases of the
                            two members of the Republics which were represented by a delegation of
                            two persons, held its first meeting at 3 o’clock in the afternoon of
                            Tuesday, the 19th of April. As its members were taking their places at
                            the long table in one of the Committee Rooms of the Monroe Palace, in
                            which the Senate of Brazil meets, and which was placed at the disposal
                            of the International Commission of Jurists, the delegation of the United
                            States proposed, on behalf of the Sub-Commission, that Mr. Pessôa, who
                            had registered in the section of Public International Law, and who was
                            present, be asked to assume the Presidency of the Sub-Commission, just
                            as in the morning the Sub-Commission of Private International Law had
                            requested Mr. Rodrigo Octavio, the other Brazilian Delegate, to preside
                            that Sub-Commission. Mr. Pessôa yielded to the unanimous desire of his
                            colleagues, and assumed the Chair.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon, the American delegation proposed that a committee of five
                            persons, with the President as its Chairman, and ex-officio an
                            additional member, be appointed by the President to examine the projects
                            of international law, in order to determine those which might reasonably
                            be considered and passed upon in the limited time at the disposal of the
                            Commission, it was understood that it would <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"
                                facs="0467"/>adjourn at least before the 24th of May, at which time
                            Messrs. Bustamante and Pessôa would be obliged to repair to Europe in
                            order to attend the sessions of the Permanent Court of International
                            Justice at The Hague, of which august tribunal they have the honor to be
                            members. It was felt that a small committee could work more quietly and
                            expeditiously than the Sub-Commission, composed of the representatives
                            of the seventeen Republics. After discussion, the suggestion was
                            adopted, and the President named the following members: Mr. Scott, of
                            the United States; Mr. [Carlos] Saavedra Lamas, of Argentina; Mr.
                            [Alejandro] Alvarez, of Chile; Mr. [Cesar] Zelaya, of Cuba; Mr. [Julio]
                            Bastos, of Uruguay. Mr. Reeves, of the American Delegation, and Mr.
                            [Luiz A.] Podestá-Costa, of Argentina, regularly attended the meetings
                            of the Committee, with the permission of its President.</p>
                        <p>The American Delegation further proposed that Mr. Pessôa’s Code of Public
                            International Law, as presented to the Commission of 1912, be considered
                            as before the present Commission; that Mr. Alvarez’ projects likewise be
                            considered as before the Commission. Mr. Pessôa assured the members that
                            he had no desire to force his Code upon the attention of the Commission,
                            and Mr. Alvarez finally stated that his project laid before the
                            Conference of Santiago had been merged in those of the American
                            Institute. The American Delegation, however, insisted, notwithstanding
                            Mr. Alvarez’ declaration, that his projects in their original form be
                            laid before the Commission for its consideration, so as to carry out to
                            the letter the Resolution of 1923, under which the International
                            Commission was constituted. The Delegation also urged that Mr. Pessôa’s
                            Code should be considered by the Commission as before it, and note taken
                            of its contents in the deliberations of the Commission. These views
                            prevailed, and the Sub-Commission of Public International Law, taking as
                            its basis the projects submitted by the Pan American Union, had also
                            before it the Code of Mr. Pessôa, and the original projects of Mr.
                            Alvarez.</p>
                        <p>The Commission thereupon adjourned, to meet at the call of the President,
                            when the Committee of five should have projects to report for its
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>This Committee frequently, and indifferently, called “Special Committee,”
                            Committee of Examination” or simply, “the Committee”, met regularly in
                            the afternoons during the month in which the International Commission
                            was in session. At its first meeting, Mr. Pessôa indicated the topics
                            which he was inclined to believe could be profitably and adequately
                            treated. They were for the most part those to be found in his own Code
                            of 1912, as well as in the projects transmitted by the Pan American
                            Union. In many instances, he expressed <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382"
                                facs="0468"/>himself as preferring the form of his Code to that of
                            the projects. To this, the Committee made no objection. The result was a
                            comparison of the drafts of 1912 and of 1924, and the amalgamation of
                            the two in the form of separate projects which Mr. Pessôa undertook to
                            prepare and lay before the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of some of the projects of the Pan American Union, he
                            proposed to defer for the moment; others of the projects, he suggested
                            should be combined and merged in a single project, so that while the
                            final product of the Commission’s work in public international law is
                            set forth in an even dozen of projects, these fairly embody the
                            substance of thirteen of the Pan American Union, or fourteen, if the
                            project of extradition, transferred from public to private international
                            law, is to be included.</p>
                        <p>It should be said, in this connection, that two of the thirty
                            projects—those on the Pan American Union (No. 9) and aerial navigation
                            (No. 20) were withdrawn from consideration at the request of the Pan
                            American Union, as these subjects were being elsewhere and otherwise
                            considered. At the request of Mr. Bustamante, the subject of extradition
                            (No. 17) was referred to the Sub-Commission on private international
                            law, as contained in his draft code. The original projects transmitted
                            by the Pan American Union were thus reduced to twenty-seven. Of these
                            twenty-seven, fourteen were adopted in whole or in part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pessôa had expressed the opinion at the first session of the
                            Committee, that some of the projects should not be discussed; that
                            others should be deferred. With the consent of the Committee, the
                            following were laid aside: The Preamble (No. 1); the General
                            Declarations (No. 2); Declaration of Pan American Unity and Cooperation
                            (No. 3); Fundamental Rights of the American Republics (No. 8); National
                            Domain (No. 10); Rights and Duties of Nations in territories in Dispute
                            on the question of Boundaries (No. 11); Jurisdiction (No. 12);
                            Diplomatic Protection (No. 16); Navigation of International Rivers (No.
                            19); Pan American Court of Justice (No. 28); Measures of Repression (No.
                            29); Conquest (No. 30).</p>
                        <p>It was, however, the view of the Committee that some of these might be
                            appropriately embodied in general declarations, such as the Declaration
                            of Pan American Unity and Cooperation; Fundamental Rights of the
                            American Republics; and the Declaration against Conquest. These were, as
                            a matter of fact, incorporated, with their general conceptions and
                            juridical aspirations, in a masterly report prepared by Mr. Maurtua, of
                            Peru, and presented in behalf of himself and Mr. [José Pedro] Varela,
                            the majority of an informal committee appointed by the President near
                            the close of the Commission, to draft a general declaration to precede
                            the projects, and to explain their nature, purpose, and significance.
                            The opposition of Mr. Al <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0469"/>varez,
                            of Chile, the third member, prevented a unanimous report; and because of
                            the lack of unanimity, the matter was dropped.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Pessôa was requested to prepare a report
                            as President of the Sub-Commission. He did so in a short and admirable
                            document which is to precede the texts of the projects actually
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>As a summary analysis of the projects of public international law as
                            finally adopted is essential to an understanding of the work of the
                            Commission, each project is briefly considered:</p>
                        <p>I. The Fundamental Bases of International Law. In this project an effort
                            is made to set forth what are usually termed the sources of
                            international law, their mutual and relative importance and validity,
                            the nature of international law and the character of its binding
                            obligations, together with the relation of public international law to
                            the municipal legal system of each of the States accepting and applying
                            the law of nations. In this project, as in all of the others, every
                            effort was made to state general principles only, but to state them
                            clearly and concisely, leaving the necessary consequences to follow of
                            themselves. It is also to be observed with reference to this, as to
                            every other project, the Commission endeavored to declare the law,
                            rather than to attempt to make it.</p>
                        <p>The text of the Fundamental Bases of International Law is to a
                            considerable extent that of Project No. 4 of the Pan American Union.</p>
                        <p>II. States: Existence—Equality—Recognition. This project embodies four
                            important, indeed fundamental principles of international law: (1) the
                            legal equality of States; (2) the duty of non-intervention; (3) the
                            doctrine of unconditional recognition of new States and (4) the
                            elimination of the distinction between <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>

                                    as regards taxes and military service, are accepted by the

                        <p>This project is also to a considerable extent the embodiment of
                            propositions contained in Projects Nos. 5, 6 and 7 of the Pan American
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>III. Status of Aliens. The purpose of this convention is to vest in the
                            States the right under international law to establish, by means of
                            municipal law, the conditions under which aliens may enter and remain
                            within their territory. It recognizes the general principle, that aliens
                            are to be entitled to the civil, other than political rights of
                            nationals, but that they may be expelled by any and every State for
                            “reasons of public order or safety,” notice of the expulsion to be
                            communicated as soon as possible to the country to which the person so
                            expelled belongs.</p>
                        <p>The convention is an amplification, with additional matter, of the
                            principles contained in Project No. 14 of the Pan American Union, and it
                            is, in the opinion of the American Delegates, an improvement on that
                            Project.</p>
                        <p>IV. Treaties. This project has a double importance, in that it states
                            general practice, and at the same time lays stress upon certain
                            tendencies which have only recently taken definite form and effect. An
                            example of this is to be found in the very first article, declaring
                            expressly what can not be too well understood—that treaties are only to
                            be made in accordance with the municipal law of the contracting States.
                            In like manner, Article 4 is a guaranty against secret treaties.</p>
                        <p>Article 6, dealing with ratifications, assumes particular importance, in
                            that it recognizes and approves reservations in multilateral treaties as
                            follows: “In international conventions celebrated between different
                            States, a reservation made by one of them in the act of ratification,
                            affects only the clause in question and the State to which it
                            refers.”</p>
                        <p>Article 15 is either a step in advance, or a statement of the most recent
                            theory and practice. “Obligations contracted by treaty shall be
                            sanctioned in cases of non-compliance as when diplomatic negotiations
                            have failed, by decision of an international Court of Justice or by an
                            arbitral tribunal.”</p>
                        <p>This disposition renders effective the Hague Conventions. In Article 16
                            of the Pacific Settlement Convention of the First Hague Peace Conference
                            of 1899,<note n="24" xml:id="d288fn24"><ref target="frus1899#pg_521"><hi

                            and efficacious means of interpreting and applying treaties and
                            conventions, when diplomacy has failed to reach an adjustment.</p>
                        <p>In the Second Hague Peace Conference, of 1907, the forty-four Powers
                            there represented, including all of the American Republics with the
                            exception of Costa Rica and Honduras, declared that the interpretation
                            and application of treaties and conventions could be submitted to
                            obligatory arbitration without reserves of any kind.<note n="25"

                        <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>The present Article reaffirms in no uncertain terms the doctrine
                            unanimously proclaimed by the two Hague Peace Conferences, and provides
                            specific machinery for its realization. This article will be considered
                            later, in a different connection.</p>
                        <p>The final Article (No. 17) provides that, “Two or more States may agree
                            that their relations are to be governed by rules other than those
                            established in general conventions celebrated by them with other
                            States.”</p>
                        <p>The convention on treaties is a happy combination of the provision
                            contained in Mr. Pessôa’s proposed Code of 1912, and Project 21 of the
                            Pan American Union, with the addition of Article 15, which is not
                            contained in either.</p>
                        <p>V. Exchange of Publications. This is peculiarly an American proposal,
                            providing for the interchange of publications of the Americas. It is
                            substantially Project No. 24 of the Pan American Union, and is the
                            realization of a long-standing aspiration. It is, in fact, with slight
                            modifications, the Convention of January 27, 1902, of the Second Pan
                            American Conference.<note n="26" xml:id="d288fn26">S. Doc. 330, 57th

                        <p>VI. Interchange of Professors and Students. This is Project No. 25 of the
                            Pan American Union and is the culmination of efforts extending over many
                            years. It is, with trifling changes, the Resolution on the Interchange
                            of Professors and Students, adopted by the Fourth Pan American
                            Conference meeting in Buenos Aires in 1910.<note n="27"

                        <p>VII. Diplomatic Agents. This project is drafted in accordance with modern
                            theory and modern practice. Its theory is that the immunities of
                            diplomatic agents exist solely for the purpose of facilitating and
                            regularizing the official contacts between States. It rejects <hi
                                rend="italic">in toto</hi> the outworn and unacceptable theory of
                            extraterritoriality.</p>
                        <p>In addition, it embodies, it is believed, the accepted practice of the
                            United States and of the other American Republics. The Commission was
                            unanimous that there should be but two classes of permanent chiefs of
                            mission: the Minister Plenipotentiary and the Chargé d’Affaires. The
                            Commission felt that in the Americas, the State, and not an official of
                            the State, should be represented, and that therefore the Ambassador,
                            representing the President, and having personal access to the President
                            of another Republic not enjoyed as of right by the Minister
                            Plenipotentiary, was inconsistent with the democratic conditions of the
                            New World.</p>
                        <p>Unwilling to change the law and practice in this respect, the Commission
                            unanimously adopted a recommendation to this effect, in the <pb n="386"
                                xml:id="pg_386" facs="0472"/>form of a <hi rend="italic">voeu</hi>
                            to the forthcoming Sixth Conference of the Americas, to meet in
                            Habana.</p>
                        <p>Article 24, which deals with specific immunities, contains in clause 3 a
                            somewhat novel suggestion, designed to meet novel but not altogether
                            unfamiliar conditions—freedom from customs duties on objects intended
                            for the diplomat’s personal use and that of his family, in a sum total
                            limited by the Government of the State to which he is accredited. The
                            basis of this admirable project was No. 22 of the Pan American Union,
                            which, in turn, with sundry provisions taken from American practice, was
                            based upon various resolutions of the Institute of International Law. It
                            is believed that the ultimate form of the present project is superior to
                            any and all of its predecessors.</p>
                        <p>VIII. Consuls. This project is believed to be of unusual merit. As in the
                            case of the project concerning diplomatic agents, that on Consuls is
                            based upon the resolutions of the Institute of International Law and
                            upon modern theory and practice, drawing a sharp distinction between
                            diplomatic and consular functions, and hence in the status respectively
                            of these two types of officials. No personal immunities are accorded to
                            consuls who, however, are protected for the purpose of the adequate
                            exercise of their official duties. The supremacy of municipal law over
                            the consul is to be presumed in absence of express stipulations to the
                            contrary.</p>

                            practice of modern times. It is not original. Its basis is the Rights
                            and Duties of Neutral States in Maritime Warfare, drafted by the Second
                            Hague Peace Conference in 1907, ratified by the United States as well as
                            by the other leading maritime powers.<note n="29" xml:id="d288fn29"

                            superior to its predecessor or model, in that it takes note of the

                            the law and the practice of the present day.</p>

                            to interpose a general reserve to the entire project on the express
                            ground that it was not only contrary to the long-established and
                            well-known policy of the United States, but also, in their opinion,
                            opposed to the generally recognized modern practice of the world at
                            large in such matters.</p>
                        <p>As, however, it appeared that all of the countries represented in the
                            Commission, with the exception of the United States, were desirous of
                            recognizing the right of asylum for political refugees, as stated in the
                            convention, the American delegates did not oppose its discussion and
                            adoption by the Commission. Their desire was in this case as in all
                            other ways, to advance the work of the Commission without interposing
                            objections to the desires of the other delegations.</p>
                        <p>It is an original project of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>XI. Obligations of States in Event of Civil War. This project, also
                            original with the Commission, undertakes to define the duty which one
                            State owes to another with which it is at peace, with reference to civil
                            war and insurgency within the other. It is believed that this short
                            project of but five paragraphs summarizes the legislation and practice
                            of the United States for more than a century. It reads like a series of
                            extracts from the Neutrality Laws of the United States, particularly
                            that of 1818.<note n="30" xml:id="d288fn30">Approved Apr. 20, 1818; 3

                        <p>XII. Pacific Settlement of International Conflicts. The purpose of this
                            project, in form and in substance that of Pan American Union No. 27, is
                            to gather in an ascending series into a single convention, the various
                            forms of pacific settlement, good-offices and mediation, commissions of
                            inquiry, conciliation and friendly composition, arbitration and judicial
                            decision. There is little or nothing new to be found <pb n="388"
                                xml:id="pg_388" facs="0474"/>in its 23 articles; whenever possible
                            the exact language of approved texts has been used, so that there might
                            be no doubt as to the acceptance of the project as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The articles relating to good offices, a word of advice to one or other
                            or both of the disputants by a third and disinterested party; and
                            mediation, similar to good offices, but bringing the process a step
                            forward by suggesting a solution, are taken from the Pacific Settlement

                        <p>The advantages of Commissions of Conciliation have been much discussed in
                            recent years, but it is only yesterday that they have been given
                            definite form in official conventions.</p>
                        <p>The present project adopts the method of settling disputes in a
                            conciliatory manner, and makes of the Governing Board of the Pan
                            American Union a permanent Commission.</p>
                        <p>Friendly composition was much used in the past, but appears to have been
                            overlooked in recent years. It was, however, resorted to by Chile and
                            the United States for the settlement of the Alsop Claim by the King of
                            England acting as friendly compositor in 1911.<note n="34"

                            adequate method for classes of disputes where the settlement is desired
                            to depend upon the good faith of a single person in whose good judgment
                            and sense of equity the parties in controversy have confidence.</p>

                            those of the Hague Conventions, and the suggestion, that, in case of a
                            desire to resort to judicial settlement of their controversies, the
                            parties in dispute may refer their differences either to the Permanent

                            justice which may be constituted for this purpose by the American

                            27 of the Pan American Union, submitted to the various American
                            Governments and transmitted by the Union to the International Commission
                            of Jurists. It is to be presumed that it had been carefully considered
                            by the Foreign Offices of the American Republics, and that they approved
                            of it, as no amendment of a critical nature was suggested in any phase
                            of its passage through the Committee of Five, the Subcommission on
                            Public Law, to its final adoption by the plenary session of the
                            Commission on May 20, 1927.</p>
                        <p>It was evidently a project in which the Governments of the Americas
                            appear to have taken a greater interest than in that of any other of the
                            projects transmitted to the Commission, for the Pan American Union
                            recommended by formal resolution the Commission to give preference to
                            the project on Pacific Settlement in case it should not have time at its
                            disposal to consider all of the projects. The preamble to the original
                            project as transmitted by the Pan American Union stated the purpose of
                            the project: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The American Republics in order to conserve the peace upon which
                                    their civilization depends, and to avert war, which menaces it,
                                    agree to have recourse for the settlement of all disputes
                                    between them, when direct negotiations have failed, to the
                                    measures regulated in the present convention.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>One of these measures was arbitration, and, according to the preamble,
                            all questions susceptible of arbitration might be submitted to an
                            arbitral tribunal constituted by the parties, provided only diplomatic
                            means have been tried and failed.</p>
                        <p>The Gondra Convention provided controversies between the American
                            Republics should be submitted to American Commissions of Inquiry,
                            composed exclusively of American members. The delegates of the United
                            States therefore stated in the plenary session of May 6, 1927, their
                            intention to submit a plan for an American Tribunal of Arbitration, for
                            the adjustment of American controversies in the form of an amendment to
                            Article 25 of the original project in order to promote arbitral
                            settlement of international controversies in this hemisphere. In the
                            opinion of the American Delegates the plan of the Commission of Inquiry
                            in the Gondra Convention suggested the improved plan for arbitral
                            settlements. In this way, controversies of which disposition could be
                            more advantageously made by an American tribunal could be referred to a
                            tribunal established for the purpose in accordance with the accepted
                            principles of arbitral procedure.</p>
                        <p>The amendment which it was contemplated to submit for the consideration
                            of the commission was to have been based upon the Convention signed at
                            Washington, February 7, 1923, by the representatives <pb n="390"

                            American States have sought agreement upon this important branch of law.
                            The United States did not participate in any of the earlier conferences
                            dealing with this subject. Among the twenty Latin-American Republics
                            there have been serious divergences of position resulting from the
                            acceptance by some of them of the system of domicile, and reception on
                            the part of the others of a system based on nationality. The Code
                            presented to the Commission for its consideration is very largely based
                            upon the system of nationality and it was at once perceived by the
                            American Delegates, that the projected Code would be opposed by the
                            representatives of those States almost wholly south of the Equator which
                            had adopted in their municipal systems the theory of domicile. The
                            opponents of Mr. Bustamante’s code, however, were not prepared to
                            present a substitute code based upon domicile, although they did insist
                            upon those portions of a code so based, known <pb n="391"

                            Delegates soon became convinced that unless the Code as prepared by Mr.
                            Bustamante was adopted at least in substance by the Commission, all
                            attempts at the codification of Private International Law at Rio de
                            Janeiro would prove abortive; that thereby the Resolution of the Fifth
                            Pan American Conference would fail of execution, and that the
                            forthcoming Sixth Conference would fail to have before it, for its
                            consideration, any constructive projects dealing with the subject. The
                            Delegates of the United States therefore determined to support wherever
                            possible, the Recommendations of the Commission by which the projected
                            code might be transmitted to Habana. This position was set forth in a
                            declaration made by the American Delegation on May 9th, as follows:<note

                                    very distinguished delegate from Cuba, Mr. Bustamante.</p>
                                <p>In so recording its affirmative vote the delegation does not
                                    desire to imply that the articles for which it votes are in
                                    accordance with the laws of the various jurisdictions of the
                                    United States, forty-nine in all. As a matter of fact and as is
                                    well known the jurisprudence of the United States is based in
                                    general upon the theory of domicile, while the project of the
                                    proposed code is based largely upon the theory of nationality.
                                    The reason for this affirmative vote is that the delegation of
                                    the United States desires to further the work of codification of
                                    private international law. It desires, furthermore, to make this
                                    recognition of what it believes to be a constructive effort of
                                    very considerable value, and it desires that, by the adoption of
                                    these articles, the forthcoming Panamerican Conference at Habana
                                    may have before it, for its mature consideration, a substantial
                                    basis for the discussion of Private International Law.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, the delegation of the United States desires to
                                    express the hope that ultimately a code of private international
                                    law may be proposed for the Americas, by which the opposing
                                    principles of the two theories of domicile and nationality may
                                    be reconciled. In this happy event it is to be hoped that the
                                    United States may be able to join with her sister republics.</p>

                        <p>The clash between the adherents of the opposing theories of domicile and
                            nationality seems to have reached its height when Article 7 of the
                            Preliminary Title of Mr. Bustamante’s code came under discussion. <pb
                                n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0478"/>Article 7 as originally drafted
                            was as follows: “Each contracting State shall apply to the nationals of
                            the others the laws of an internal public order of their domicile or of
                            their nationality, according to the system adopted by the State to which
                            they belong.” Thereupon, Mr. Bustamante withdrew Article 7 as originally
                            proposed and, after the whole of the code had been substantially
                            approved in the closing days of the Commission, proposed a substitute
                            for Article 7 as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Each contracting State shall apply as personal law that of the
                                    domicile or that of the nationality according to the system
                                    which its domestic legislation may have adopted or may hereafter
                                    adopt.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is to be observed that there seems to be no substantial difference
                            between the original and amended form, as it failed to satisfy the
                            Delegates of the States choosing a system of domicile, who were frank in
                            the expression of their desire to have the system adopted by them
                            prevail universally in the Americas.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, one portion of Mr. Bustamante’s code in which it is
                            believed the United States have an immediate and direct interest—namely
                            the title concerning extradition. In the opinion of the American
                            Delegates, this subject should have been retained by the Subcommission
                            of International Public Law, using Project No. 17 of the Pan American
                            Union as a basis of discussion collated with the draft in Mr.
                            Bustamante’s code. However, the provisions on the subject in his code
                            seem generally to be in accord with the law of the United States and
                            their accepted practice; but in order to reach a maximum of agreement,
                            the Delegates of the United States suggested that extraditable offenses
                            should not be determined on the basis of minimum punishment, but
                            specifically listed as such in the various treaties and conventions
                            dealing with extradition. This suggestion was adopted in Article
                            346.</p>
                        <p>The question of the extradition by a State of its own nationals aroused
                            considerable discussion. In Mr. Bustamante’s proposed code, Article 347
                            was as follows: “The contracting States are not obliged to hand over
                            their own nationals.” While the provision thus stated would leave each
                            of the contracting parties free to adopt its own policy in this respect,
                            it was felt that, in the interest of international justice, some
                            obligation should be imposed upon the State refusing to do so. Therefore
                            the following clause was added: “The nation which declines to hand over
                            one of its own citizens must try him.” Although the provision contained
                            in Article 380, that, “In no case shall the death penalty be imposed or
                            executed for the offense upon which the extradition is founded,” appears
                            in certain extradition treaties to which the Government of the United
                            States is a party, the American Delegation has some doubts as to the
                            wisdom <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0479"/>of its adoption of such
                            a general policy. In their opinion, the abolition of capital punishment,
                            if considered desirable, should be by direct enactment, rather than
                            indirectly by treaty arrangement.</p>

                        <p>On May 6th, the President of the Commission read the foregoing telegram
                            to the plenary session of that date, and his proposed answer in the
                            following terms: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Commission of Jurists of an exclusively juridical character,
                                    without power, quality, or political qualifications, it is not
                                    permissible to express an opinion upon the subject contained in
                                    your cablegram. I have the honor to present to your Excellency
                                    the assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                        <p>The President’s proposed answer was unanimously approved as read by him
                            and it was immediately transmitted to its destination.</p>
                        <p>It was therefore not to be expected that political proposals or proposals
                            with a political implication would be presented and that, if they were,
                            they would not receive consideration. However, there were presented from
                            time to time propositions falling under one or other of the above
                            categories. In each case, the Commission refused to take favorable
                            action, and contented itself with referring them to the approaching Pan
                            American Conference at Habana, without recommendation. There are four
                            instances which should be specially mentioned:</p>
                        <p>1) In the Subcommission, on April 30th, and at the plenary session of May
                            9th, the proposition originally presented by the Dominican Delegate, and
                            in which the Mexican Delegation joined as a proposing party at the last
                            plenary session, of May 20th, in which projects were considered.</p>
                        <p>It is thus worded: “No State may in the future directly or indirectly,
                            nor by reason of any motive, occupy even temporarily any portion of the
                            territory of another State. The consent given to the occupying State by
                            the State occupied will not legitimatize the occupation and the occupant
                            will be responsible for all occurrences resulting from the occupation
                            not only with respect to the State occupied, but to third parties as
                            well.”</p>
                        <p>2) At the same plenary session of May 9th, the Haitian Delegate presented
                            a proposition to the effect that treaties procured by pressure or menace
                            of armed force should be considered as intervention. He presented his
                            proposition in the last working plenary session of the Commission of May
                            20th, in the following form: “Any action carried out by a State, whether
                            by means of diplomatic pressure or by armed <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396"
                                facs="0482"/>force, in order to force its will upon that of the
                            other State, constitutes intervention.”</p>
                        <p>3) The Argentine Delegation had already proposed in the same plenary
                            session of May 9th, to add, “or external” to the following text
                            unanimously adopted by the Subcommission of Public International Law: “A
                            State may not intervene in the internal affairs [nor in the external
                                affairs]<note n="41" xml:id="d288fn41">Brackets appear in the
                                original report.</note> of another State.”</p>
                        <p>In this condition of affairs, Mr. Reeves, on behalf of the American
                            Delegation made the following statement:<note n="42" xml:id="d288fn42"

                                <p>The third article has been carefully expressed in general terms.
                                    If, however, it is determined to depart from the general theory
                                    of this project by introducing various details and particular
                                    cases, I shall be obliged to call attention to two exceptions to
                                    the general rule: 1st, on grounds of humanity; 2nd, in
                                    self-defense. I do not desire to seem unmindful of the legal
                                    basis upon which the United States, on grounds of humanity
                                    intervened to stop a régime of inhumanity in Cuba, as a result
                                    of which Cuba was freed. But I hope that this will not be
                                    necessary because of the recognition and acceptance of the
                                    general principles of Projects 1 and 2, and that in the future
                                    there will be no opportunity for the recognition of these
                                    exceptions.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The whole matter was referred back to the Subcommission for
                            consideration—the Delegation of the United States abstaining from the
                            vote.</p>
                        <p>4) A proposal of a somewhat similar nature by the Paraguayan Delegate is
                            as follows: “Intervention or any act of a State within the territory of
                            another State without a previous declaration of war, with the intent to
                            decide by force, material pressure, or moral coercion, internal or
                            external questions of the other State, will be considered as a violation
                            of international law.”</p>
                        <p>The American delegation under these circumstances repeated on May 20th
                            the formal statement made in the plenary session of May 9th, whereupon
                            the following action was taken by the Commission in the plenary session
                            of May 20th, the last, as has already been remarked, in which it
                            considered projects, as appears from the official report presented by

                                    questions. For this reason the Commission decided to transmit
                                    and to submit some of them for the consideration of the Sixth
                                    International Conference to meet in 1928 in the city of

                        <p>There are two articles in the project on treaties, which should be
                            considered in this connection. There had been at various times proposals
                            to exclude intervention even with the consent of the States
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>The American delegation took the position that no such act arising out of
                            the consent of a State could be considered as an act of intervention
                            properly so called and in the sense of Article 3 of the Project No. 2 on
                            States, and that, furthermore, any such attempt would be an unacceptable
                            limitation of the State’s sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>That this view prevailed appears from Article 17 of the project on
                            Treaties, providing in express terms that, “Two or more States may agree
                            that their relations are to be governed by rules other than those
                            established in general conventions celebrated by them with other
                            States.”</p>
                        <p>There is a further example of an Article, although expressed in general
                            terms, which was considered to have a political implication. The Chilean
                            Delegate took exception to Article 15 of the project on Treaties as
                            submitted by the President to the Commission. It was as follows: “If one
                            of the States [parties to a treaty]<note n="44" xml:id="d288fn44"
                                >Brackets appear in the original report.</note> fails wholly or in
                            any respect to fulfill the obligation which it has contracted, the other
                            can exact the fulfillment or consider the treaty as abrogated.” The
                            Peruvian Delegation made no objection to the article as drafted by the
                            President, but, upon the insistence of the Chilean Delegate, the
                            Commission struck out the article, the American Delegation expressing
                            the hope that a substitute might be drafted which would satisfy the
                            opposing views of the Delegates in question. This hope was realized, for
                            in the last plenary session and as the last act, the following
                            substitute, drafted by the Peruvian Delegation, was unanimously adopted:
                            “Obligations contracted by treaty shall be sanctioned in cases of
                            non-compliance as when diplomatic negotiations have failed, by decision
                            of an international Court of Justice or by an arbitral tribunal.”</p>
                        <p>A source of difficulty which has already been mentioned in passing
                            deserves to be dealt with in some detail. Each of the twenty-one
                            American Republics was invited by the Resolution of Santiago de Chile,
                            creating the International Commission of Jurists, to appoint two
                            delegates, no doubt in the belief that in this way a specialist <pb
                                n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0484"/>in each of two branches of
                            international science would attend and participate in the labors of the
                            Commission. In the event four or five of the Central American Republics
                            were not represented, and of the seventeen Republics sending delegates,
                            eight sent but one delegate each. This made it necessary for the single
                            delegate to attend the sessions of both Subcommissions and, on this
                            account, the remaining nine States each having two delegates were
                            generally represented in both Subcommissions by their two delegates. To
                            accommodate the eight States, each with one single delegate, the
                            Subcommissions were obliged to meet at different hours—an arrangement
                            which hampered the work of the Subcommission on Public International
                            Law, as, meeting in the afternoons, it was obliged to give way to the
                            meetings of the Committee of this Subcommission, for the plenary
                            sessions, as well as for certain social duties. Considering the
                            encroachments thus effected, the work of the Commission in the field of
                            International Public Law in agreeing upon a dozen conventions may
                            properly be held to be an eminently satisfactory achievement. On the
                            other hand, the Subcommission on Private International Law was enabled
                            to devote on an average, three hours in the morning of each day, with
                            scarcely an interruption throughout the five weeks of the Conference.
                            This arrangement was not satisfactory to the American Delegation, but it
                            was impossible to secure any material modification of it.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties due to diversity in language have been evident in all
                            international conferences. It is well known that the American
                            Conferences have four official languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French
                            and English. However, at formal Conferences arrangements are usually
                            made for rapid and accurate translation of the proceedings as they occur
                            for such members of the Conference as may, for one reason or another,
                            request it. In the case of a Commission such as the one under
                            consideration, where discussion and debate were informal and technical
                            in nature, continuous translation would have greatly interrupted the
                            course of proceedings and materially curtailed the exchange of views and
                            limited its results. In the Subcommission of Private International Law
                            the basic text used was Spanish, although the projected code of private
                            international law was furnished to each government and its
                            representatives in each of the four official languages of the Americas.
                            The projects on public international law were likewise transmitted by
                            the Pan American Union in the four languages, but in the various
                            sections dealing with public law the President used Portuguese, drafted
                            the projects in Portuguese, and distributed them to the members in
                            Portuguese. In view of these facts the American delegation suggested
                            that, while the four languages were equally official, in case of doubt
                            or disagreement as <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0485"/>to the
                            meaning of a project, the language of the Capital in which the
                            Commission was sitting should be accepted as authoritative. Courtesy as
                            well as expediency suggested this, in the opinion of the Delegates of
                            the United States. The delegations which expressed themselves as in
                            accord with the American view were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia
                            and Peru. The result is four different versions which, if the experience
                            of international conferences is to be enlightening, will disclose not
                            unimportant divergences in meaning, with the requirement of a knowledge
                            of the four languages on the part of those who use them, and a minute
                            scrutiny of each version.</p>
                        <p>With these difficulties out of the way, the reasons for the success of
                            the Commission should be mentioned. The element which made for success
                            more than any other, and indeed all others, was the desire of success
                            constantly expressed by the Brazilian Government through its
                            sympathetic, courteous and broadminded Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr.
                            Octavio Mangabeira, from the opening session to his farewell banquet to
                            the Delegates, with which it closed. The Commission was thus surrounded
                            with a congenial atmosphere proceeding from his evidently sincere desire
                            and ambition that the meeting should justify the Americas in choosing
                            the Capital of Brazil as the seat of the Commission’s deliberations. The
                            hospitalities, official and private, tendered to the members of the
                            Commission were many and varied. They brought the delegates together and
                            enabled them in an atmosphere of friendly informality to learn each
                            other’s views and to appreciate those qualities of grace and courtesy
                            which are sometimes missing from official discussions. The American
                            Delegates could not fail to notice, what they were pleased to consider
                            an implied compliment to their country, in having the Commission meet in
                            the Monroe Palace, the official seat of the Brazilian Senate, where
                            everything tended to the comfort and convenience of the Commission and
                            its members.</p>
                        <p>The Delegates of the United States believe themselves justified in
                            calling attention to another element making for success. The careful and
                            satisfactory preparation in advance of the Commission, due in large part
                            to private initiative. The American Institute of International Law,
                            composed of five publicists of each of the twenty-one American
                            Republics, and of which the American Delegates are themselves members,
                            prepared at the request of the Pan American Union the series of Projects
                            of Public International Law and the projected Code on the Conflict of
                            Laws, which were transmitted by the Governing Board of the Pan American
                            Union a year or more in advance of the meeting to the governments of the
                            Americas for their consideration. This was made possible by the
                            munificence and far-sighted generosity of the Carnegie Endowment for
                            International Peace, <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0486"/>which
                            enabled the American Institute to hold its sessions and to prepare both
                            the projects and code, and which bore the entire expense of the printing
                            and the distribution of the preparatory work accomplished by the
                            American Institute of International Law and in the form in which it was
                            laid before the Commission by the Pan American Union.</p>
                        <p>The services of the American Institute were formally recognized by the
                            Commission of Jurists in plenary session by a vote of thanks<note n="46"

                            and looked forward to a closer and more intimate association of the
                            Americas in the future.</p>
                        <p>“It is my desire,” he began, “that in this final session all those who
                            are interested in the codification of international law in America may
                            find an enumeration, at least a simple enumeration, of the work
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>“The Commission of Jurists prepared a general convention of International
                            private law and, in addition, twelve projects of International public
                            law, having to do with the following subjects:</p>
                        <p>“Fundamental bases of international law; States—existence, equality,
                            recognition; status of aliens; treaties; exchange of publications;
                            interchange of professors and students; diplomatic agents; consuls;
                            maritime neutrality; asylum; and the pacific settlement of international

                        <p>“As the Commission will see, our efforts were not unproductive; to the
                            contrary, they give great promise for fruit from our labor. A general
                            convention of international private law and the twelve projects
                            regarding the important points of international public law—here you have
                            that which the Commission of Jurists was able to accomplish in this
                            second session, in the short space of one month during which it
                            met.”</p>

                        <p>And of the future, he ventured to express the hope “that shortly we may
                            be able to reunite the Americas in a vast and majestic confederation of
                            interests, of aspirations and of common ideals, in the midst of which
                            all States, be they grand or small, may tranquilly live, prosper and
                            progress in an ambient of true independence, of justice and of
                            liberty.”</p>
                        <p>After the applause with which his address was greeted, Dr. Leopoldo Melo,
                            of Argentina, Member of the American Institute, President of the
                            Argentine Society of International Law, and nominee of the Presidency of
                            Argentina by one of the political parties of that great and progressive
                            nation, was called upon to voice the appreciation of his fellow
                            delegates. From Dr. Melo’s carefully prepared address the American
                            Delegates believe that at least a few paragraphs of his calm and
                            measured pronouncement should find a place in their official report.
                            They have ventured to select the following extracts as showing how a
                            statesman of the most southern of American Republics speaking under a
                            sense of political responsibility, as well as principle, views the
                            Commission and its labors:</p>
                        <p>[Here follow extracts from Mr. Melo’s address.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. Melo’s address was immediately followed by that of Mr. Garcia Ortiz,

                            connection, that he was Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country at
                            the time when the treaty between Colombia and the United States, signed

                            they had labored unceasingly for the codification of international law,

                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, who had appeared and graciously
                            consented to preside at the session, arose—in what is always an
                            impressive and solemn moment in international gatherings—to close the
                            Commission. His few words, spoken in behalf of the United States of
                            Brazil, which he has the honor to represent in its foreign relations,
                            were instinct with regard for the Delegations, with respect for the
                            countries which they represented, and with appreciation for the labors
                            of the Commission, which he was to adjourn <hi rend="italic">sine

                            American Jurists, I am pleased,” he said, “to declare publicly to you
                            all the approval which the Government of Brazil desired to be the <pb
                                n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0488"/>first to voice, and to express
                            the gratitude of America for the most important services which you have
                            just rendered. The Government of Brazil congratulates itself for having
                            convoked this assembly which in adjourning today is, however, not
                            dissolved without having deserved the benedictions of the friends of
                            peace and of justice. Carry away and transmit, gentlemen, to the nations
                            of which you are the representatives, to their peoples and their
                            governments, the assurances of respect and of loyal friendship of the
                            people and government of Brazil. May my last words be in honor of
                            America, the last which shall echo and reecho in these halls and in this
                            beautiful manifestation of continental fraternity. To America! To its
                            moral progress, to its increasing economic prosperity, to its political
                            greatness. To America! To America, happy, industrious, pacific! To
                            America, that it may the better contribute to the advancement of
                            humanity.”</p>
                        <p>On the evening of Saturday, May 21st, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            offered, on behalf of the Government of Brazil, a banquet to the
                            Delegates and the ladies accompanying them. In the course of the evening
                            he took advantage of the occasion to express in gracious and generous
                            terms, vibrating with an emotion which he did not attempt to conceal,
                            the feelings of regret and appreciation with which he and his government
                            took leave of their departing guests.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow extracts from Mr. Mangabeira’s remarks.]</p>
                        <p>It is customary in strictly official banquets offered by the Government
                            of Brazil to have the Presiding Officer toast the guests, and to request
                            one of them to respond with a toast to the President of the Republic. On
                            this occasion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs honored the American
                            Delegation with the request that Mr. Scott propose, on behalf of his
                            colleagues, the toast to the President. He did so in a few remarks,
                            which he deemed appropriate to the occasion, thanking the Brazilian
                            hosts for their hospitality and courtesy, for which he ventured to coin
                            the expressions, Brazilian hospitality and Brazilian courtesy, voicing
                            appreciation of the attentions lavished upon them by the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, who, laying aside his official duties, had anticipated
                            the desires of his guests and satisfied their most exacting
                            requirements. And he ended by declaring that the codification of the law
                            of nations and of the conflict of laws had ceased to be a dream, because
                            of its realization by the Commission in the incomparable capital of
                            Brazil.</p>
                        <p>With those expressions of gratitude, of appreciation, and of a purpose
                            accomplished, the International Commission of Jurists passed into
                            history.</p>

                            Jurists, which sat in Rio de Janeiro for the short space of a month?

                            stated in a masterly manner by Mr. Maurtua, the Delegate of Peru, in a
                            statement which is at once the envy and the despair of the American
                            Delegates. Therefore, they asked Mr. Maurtua’s permission to include it
                            in their official report to their Government. The permission was at once
                            and graciously granted, in plenary session.<note n="49"

                                1927, contain a statement by Mr. Maurtua in which he expresses
                                appreciation for the generous spirit of the United States Delegation
                                in offering to include in its report the statement prepared by him;
                                Mr. Alvarez, the Chilean Delegate, then observes that the “statement

                            <p>“The International Commission of Jurists has been in session for a
                                month, in order to accomplish the mission confided to it by the Pan
                                American Conferences. The result of its deliberations consists in
                                twelve draft conventions of public international law, a general
                                convention of private international law, and a plan of organization
                                for the permanent and continuous workings of American
                                legislation.</p>
                            <p>“This result should still be viewed as an attempt to formulate the
                                law destined to regulate inter-American relations. Their complexity,
                                both in public and in private law, the supreme importance of many of
                                the legal relations regulated in the drafts, the difficulties, some
                                of them hitherto insuperable, in adopting uniform rules or in
                                developing certain essential but vaguely enunciated principles, show
                                that what has now been realized is but the first stage, subject to
                                correction, in an undefined journey which is to be continued as time
                                goes on. The significance of the work done, then, lies not so much
                                in its content as in what it reveals of the possibility of
                                formulating law in America, and of the exigencies of this great
                                undertaking in the future.</p>
                            <p>“This attempt of American jurists is the first one in the world
                                brought into an organic form by the mandate of the Governments of a
                                Continent. The first need, therefore, was that of determining the
                                program and methods to be followed, or the procedure conducive to
                                determining the subjects suitable for enactment, or the content
                                itself of the task, and the mode or modes of dealing with them in
                                order to reach satisfactory conclusions.</p>
                            <p>“In dealing with the preparation of international conventions, we
                                must constantly bear in mind the conditions controlling the States
                                in their acceptance of obligations with regard to each subject of
                                international law. Indeed, what makes each subject possible for
                                legislation is the certainty of such conditions and of their scope
                                and limits. Such is the prime fundamental basis which those who
                                prepare codification in America in the future are to build upon.</p>
                            <p>“But this governmental element which, in brief, is a fact or an
                                empirical point of legislation, is not sufficient. In order that
                                this work may acquire the excellence, the lofty spirit and the
                                nobility proper for international legislation in a group of young
                                idealistic <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0490"/>nations like
                                ours, which are aspiring to constitute on the continent an
                                exceptional region of justice, liberty and human welfare, it is
                                indispensable that the actual desire of the States, as the synthesis
                                of circumstantial or transitory national interests, be explained or
                                clarified at times, corrected at other times, and given in all
                                cases, so far as possible, the directions which are most generous
                                and most consistent with the conclusions of the international
                                science as the exponent of the most select thought and highest
                                rectitude among men. Such is the second constitutional basis for the
                                elaboration of American legislative work.</p>
                            <p>“These two bases have been laid down in the program which the
                                Commission of Jurists is presenting to the consideration of the
                                Governments and of the approaching Sixth Pan American
                                Conference.</p>
                            <p>“Because they have not hitherto existed, the International Commission
                                of Jurists has on some occasions hesitated, and on others met
                                serious inconveniences in reducing to concrete contractual formulas
                                given principles necessary in international life.</p>
                            <p>“The main inconveniences have arisen out of the difficulties inherent
                                in distinguishing between pure law and law with political tendencies
                                calculated to bear an influence on existing questions in controversy
                                between American Republics. Those difficulties have often been
                                insuperable and have prejudiced, contrary to the desire of the
                                International Commission of Jurists itself, the sincere and frank
                                expression of great principles of law in all phases of their
                                application.</p>
                            <p>“In international conferences in Europe and America, the problem of
                                eliminating the influence of political questions has not been
                                difficult to solve because everything was limited to dealing with
                                subjects not connected with questions pending between the States.
                                But those who are engaged in formulating international law by taking
                                up its entire content and beginning with its fundamentals, would not
                                be able to subtract from the law its inevitable, political content,
                                without ignoring certain essential principles. Such an omission
                                would be inexcusable in the framework of international legislation,
                                and it would, in itself, carry an admission of the political
                                questions actuating their omission. In this way, we should have in
                                the defect precisely what was sought to be avoided, at the cost of
                                the very substance of all legal regulation. This, as is seen, is a
                                field sown with obstacles, and one which the International
                                Commission of Jurists has had to tread with consummate prudence.</p>
                            <p>“Positive law, in general, takes its root in the conceptions of
                                natural reason and the human sentiment of justice. If it is to be a
                                law worthy of civilization, those elements should never be ignored;
                                nor should they be offended in any case; nor is it to be permitted
                                that its provisions should fail to be inspired by them in the
                                greatest possible degree. But positive law is not, domestically or
                                externally, nor can it be at any given moment, the natural law or
                                the finished expression of justice. This—justice—is a progressive
                                and perennial, but not precipitant realization by the positive law,
                                which in every stage of its formulation is nevertheless subordinated
                                to the complexity of human life, involving the consideration and
                                comparative control of factors of different kinds and, <hi

                                which yield only gradually to its influence, but fortunately
                                yielding more and more.</p>

                            <p>“In this way is sketched the explanation of how the American jurists,
                                through the possible formulas adopted in the draft projects, accept
                                and proclaim in all their amplitude the rights and duties of nations
                                in their purest and noblest meaning within the full radius of action
                                necessary for them as a reality in American life.</p>
                            <p>“The human person within organized societies, and the States within
                                the Society of Nations, have only one law. The law of persons
                                springs from the individual conscience. The law of nations springs
                                also from their consciousness of nationality. They are different
                                aspects of human life and different areas of application of a single
                                law which has for its end justice, secure and harmonious contacts,
                                and reciprocal cooperation, assuring general welfare.</p>
                            <p>“Nations, like persons, have the right to exist and to preserve their
                                existence. This right, like others, cannot be exercised absolutely
                                as it would be injuring in its name the very right to life and
                                self-preservation of innocent nations. Such a limitation is absolute
                                and essential, but it is of a kind different from that of the
                                salutary limitation of the right of independence.</p>
                            <p>“Independence is the affirmation of the legal personality of nations.
                                Its concept and function in the life of States is irreconcilable
                                with any control in its internal or external affairs intended to be
                                imposed upon them by any method of coercion by a foreign will. Any
                                nation invested with a right by international law can demand that it
                                be respected and protected by all other nations because right and
                                duty are correlative, it being incumbent upon all to respect the
                                right of each. This is the necessary equality in law and in capacity
                                to exercise the faculties which spring from sovereignty and
                                independence. But that independence is not absolute. It is governed
                                by the justice and cooperation necessary in the legal community of
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>“In America cooperation finds special circumstances. The American
                                nations hold common political ideals, and their history and
                                geography have created between them for a century, commercial,
                                social and spiritual bonds of a kind not different but closer than
                                with the rest of the world. Since the revolution of independence a
                                current of friendship and fraternity has been flowing over the
                                continent, passing boundaries in good fortune and in bad. This
                                situation would nevertheless not be sufficient to produce a
                                well-defined obligation of cooperation if those circumstances did
                                not create, as they have done, a state of things in virtue of which
                                the welfare of each American State, in its democratic régime and in
                                its external position, affects all States, as they do affect them.
                                There is the root of the foundation of the American cooperation
                                which imposes various and important duties, and which ought to be
                                organized in forms in which the life of a continent can be expressed
                                as a whole, without exceeding respect for internal sovereignty and
                                external independence of States. The initial organization is
                                constituted now by the continental conferences, the Pan American
                                Union, and the International Commission of Jurists. There is,
                                besides, a series of organs for limited functions of continental
                                cooperation. All this comparatively incipient organization requires
                                progressive, gradual development, parallel with the growth of the
                                spirit of solidarity and with the ever louder and clearer
                                affirmation of the American legal consciousness.</p>
                            <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0492"/>
                            <p>“The duties derived from the law of cooperation do not have, nor can
                                they have, a contractual character, nor can they be executory in
                                law. But they are none the less necessary in the common life of our
                                Republics. They pertain, properly speaking, to the high-minded and
                                moral manner in which the rights are to be exercised. Sovereignty,
                                which is the internal phase of independence, implies the duty of
                                sincerely maintaining democratic and republican forms, in order to
                                insure stable order and a regime of guaranties for all the
                                inhabitants of the territory. The historical destiny of America, in
                                being built up by the efforts of all men of the earth who are
                                seeking liberty, work and happiness, demands of each Republic the
                                special duty of realizing that destiny within itself. Independence,
                                which is the external phase of sovereignty, implies in its turn the
                                duty of not withholding its aid in all the works of continental
                                coordination.</p>
                            <p>“The rights and duties which are expressed would not be sufficient to
                                assure legal tranquility and peace on the continent. These are to
                                repose upon inviolability of the territory of the American
                                Republics, upon respect for obligations of treaties freely
                                negotiated and accepted, and on the régime of international justice
                                to give the necessary sanction, with the exclusion of force, to all
                                the essential rights of nations. American law must be founded on the
                                reciprocal guaranty of territorial integrity. Every future act of
                                conquest should be condemned. Neither war, nor the threat of war,
                                nor the presence of armed force, constitutes a legitimate mode of
                                acquiring territory. In the wake of acquisitions effected by such
                                means, there would arise incurable insecurity.</p>
                            <p>“The history of America is free from the stain of popular hatreds and
                                rivalries among its nations. The territory of any one of them
                                exceeds its immediate needs and will exceed for many generations its
                                possibility of assimilation or of utilization. The development of
                                the unlimited riches embraced within each Republic is a work of
                                great enterprise, destined to absorb all its energy and activity.
                                Consequently, there is nothing which could explain any aggression
                                whatever prompted by malign covetousness of foreign territory. For
                                more than a hundred years America has lived with its powerful right
                                of extra-continental territorial integrity. It will continue so to
                                live, with this same strong right as now affirmed by the voices of
                                each and all of the constituent Republics, because they possess the
                                consciousness of their own destiny and capacity for their
                                responsibilities. Moreover, it will be governed in the future by the
                                powerful law of inter-American territorial integrity. The relations
                                of the American Republics in this field being established among
                                themselves and with the rest of the world, they will be inspired by
                                the strongest desire for harmony, equity and justice, and in
                                practice will conduct themselves in foreign affairs and diplomacy
                                under the domination of truth and the most salutary influences of
                                public opinion.</p>
                            <p>“The enumerated principles are summed up in the following large and
                                solid legal bases: independence, realization of common political
                                ideals, territorial integrity, régime of international justice in
                                place of force, non-intervention, equality and cooperation. Such are
                                the advanced aims for American legislation. They are all contained
                                as principles in the draft projects of public international law.
                                Their regulation or their development, in their various modalities,
                                is not a <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0493"/>work that can be
                                realized at any one time, nor at a given moment. It is a work of
                                legal evolution. Nor is it an exclusive function of official jurists
                                called to present formulas susceptible of immediate realization. On
                                the basis of those principles the Governments themselves, through
                                the medium of their diplomatic representatives, are the ones who
                                should, in the legislative sessions of the Pan American Conferences,
                                trace out the regulations and developments compatible with the state
                                of inter-American relations, with the exigencies of policy, with
                                national interests, with all the factors, in sum, which make up the
                                complexity of practical international life, which is always for
                                civilized nations a compromise between what <hi rend="italic">ought
                                    to be</hi> and what <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, or between the
                                ideal of law and of justice and the human reality which is relative
                                justice and imperfect law influenced by the interests of the
                                States.</p>
                            <p>“In private international law this same situation has in a certain
                                manner presented itself to the International Commission of Jurists.
                                The two doctrines of the laws of nationality and domicile for
                                governing personal relations are embodied in the legislation of
                                different American Republics. Each one of the groups considers its
                                system as a fact of transcendent public order affecting its social,
                                economic, and political constitution. There is no way for the
                                present of settling upon one uniform law.</p>
                            <p>“In this matter, therefore, the same as in public law, a compromise
                                with reality has been unavoidable. The Republics will continue to
                                apply as the personal law, what their domestic system prescribes.
                                Happily, that does not imply an impossibility of regulating private
                                international law in a vast field of legal relations which are not
                                affected by the applications of personal law. Neither does it imply
                                the necessity nor the convenience of renewing partial or
                                sub-regional concerts on the continent founded upon the system of
                                the two laws adopted for personal relations. Quite the contrary: the
                                common interest consists in keeping the work within the Pan American
                                concert until reaching, by a continuous effort of reciprocal
                                penetration, the solution of the divergence in a system of
                                legislative uniformity.</p>
                            <p>“All America should be viewed legally as a single field in which the
                                relations of individuals and of States are in play. The rivalry of
                                national laws should be settled by the selection of the most
                                adequate, in justice, for the relations to be dealt with. Relations
                                between States are also contests of laws and sovereignties which
                                should be regulated by laws superior to the individual sovereignties
                                which are the most adequate, because the most just, to insure
                                peaceful coexistence and the welfare of all the members of the
                                American international system. Here we have the integral concept of
                                American law. Its analytical formulas will be a ‘continuous

                                States has the honor to request Your Excellency to bring to the
                                attention of the members of the Commission this communication, which
                                the American delegation will submit in the form of an amendment when
                                the said Commission enters on the discussion of project No. 27, of
                                the Projects of Convention prepared at the request, on January 2,
                                1924, of the Governing Board of the Pan American Union to be
                                submitted for the consideration of the International Commission of
                                Jurists and submitted by the American Institute of International Law
                                to the Governing Board of the Pan American Union, March 2, 1925.</p>
                            <p>The project which the Delegation of the United States will submit for

                                International Law contemplates the establishment of a Permanent
                                Inter-american Arbitration Tribunal which would be able to guarantee
                                effectively the rights of the American Republics and to maintain
                                unalterably peace and harmony in their reciprocal relations without
                                obliging them to resort in any case to armed force.</p>
                            <p>The justification for the undertaking to resort to arbitration, which
                                we shall have the honor to bring to the attention of the
                                Subcommission, is found quite admirably expressed in the preamble of
                                the Convention for the Establishment of a Central American Tribunal,
                                signed February 7, 1923, in the preparation of which former
                                Secretary of State Hughes took an active part. The following is the
                                text of the engagement as found in the first article of the said
                                Central American Convention.</p>

                            <p>There is no need to emphasize the importance of such a proposal, the
                                acceptance of which would guarantee for all time both the
                                territorial integrity and the political independence of each of the
                                American Republics, and which would maintain peace between them.</p>
                            <p>The proposal, which the American delegation will present in due time,
                                is not only in conformity with the aspirations and the best
                                traditions of North America, but also of each of the Latin American
                                Republics.</p>
                            <p>If the proposal be eventually adopted with such modifications as may
                                be judged necessary, all violations of international law as well as
                                all violations of the rights and duties of the Republics will be
                                submitted to arbitration. We feel quite certain that the project
                                which we will submit to the Commission is inspired by our common
                                aspirations and that it will make an irresistible appeal to the
                                juridical conscience of the continent.</p>

                                Delegation of the United States, I wish to make the following
                                statement: It was our proposal to present for the kind consideration
                                of the International Commission of American Jurists a most liberal
                                project, and we reserved the right to prepare this in the form of an
                                amendment to the project relative to pacific settlement by means of
                                arbitration. But owing to the difficulty of submitting to the
                                Commission questions which require a definite solution, we have
                                resolved not to present it here and now. As the problem of
                                establishing an American tribunal of arbitration is difficult and
                                laborious, not possible of definitive discussion and solution in an
                                assembly such as this, comprised exclusively of jurists, we have
                                believed that we ought to abandon the attempt to modify, in any way,
                                the method which now exists, leaving for a more favorable future
                                occasion the discussion of these questions by delegates provided
                                with political powers.</p>

                                    recognised to have the right, in so far as existing differences

                            Government to his communication of June 7, 1927.</p>

                                    amended draft convention on this subject submitted with the
                                    report of the sub-committee of the Committee of Experts, it may
                                    be stated that the taking of testimony relating to criminal
                                    cases in foreign countries by the use of letters rogatory, with
                                    which Article I of the amended draft deals, is a process for
                                    which no provision has been made by the legislation of the
                                    Federal Government and one which under the system prevailing in
                                    the United States can be employed, if at all, only pursuant to
                                    the laws of the several states. It is not deemed advisable to
                                    make commitments by international convention to change the
                                    existing practice in this regard prevailing in the United
                                    States. Moreover, evidence obtained in foreign countries through
                                    letters rogatory could not be used in criminal cases in the
                                    United States, since under the Constitution the accused must be
                                    confronted by the witnesses against him.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the second Article of the revised draft it may be
                                    stated that the Government of the United States is not prepared
                                    to commit itself to serve summonses emanating with foreign
                                    courts on witnesses or experts resident in the United States or
                                    to surrender persons in custody, except through the process of
                                    extradition.</p>
                                <p>It is the view of the Government of the United States that the
                                    matter of the surrender of exhibits dealt with in the third
                                    Article of the amended draft convention can be adequately
                                    provided for in extradition treaties. Indeed, provisions for the
                                    surrender of property in possession of fugitives are contained
                                    in some of the extradition treaties of the United States. The
                                    list of treaties appended to the report, as examples of judicial
                                    cooperation, indicates that the subject as heretofore treated,
                                    is closely related to extradition.</p>
                                <p>While conventions on the subject of judicial cooperation
                                    doubtless serve a useful purpose among countries in close
                                    geographic proximity to each other, it is not apparent that
                                    uniform application of such agreements is necessary.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question No</hi>. 9. The experience of the
                                    Government of the United States has not revealed any
                                    considerable uncertainty regarding the legal position and
                                    functions of consuls. Furthermore, this matter has been the
                                    subject of numerous provisions in bilateral treaties. It is the
                                    view of the Government of the United States that no compelling
                                    necessity exists for the treatment of this subject by a general
                                    international convention.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question No</hi>. 10. The Government of the
                                    United States does not consider it desirable to revise the
                                    classifications of diplomatic agents as proposed. No
                                    circumstances or conditions demonstrating the desirability of
                                    changing the classification have been revealed nor is there
                                    reason to expect that the purposed change, if made, would effect
                                    any material improvement.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States does not consider that the
                                    regulation by multilateral international agreement of questions
                                    eight and nine or the change of classification proposed in
                                    question ten is desirable or attainable in the near future.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Question No</hi>. 11. The Government of the
                                    United States is inclined to the view that an international
                                    agreement on the subject of <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413"

                                    cases against foreign states, would serve a useful purpose, and
                                    would therefore be desirable and that there should be no
                                    insuperable obstacle to the concluding of an agreement on that
                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States thanks the Secretary General
                                    for the report on “Effect of the most-favored-nation clause”
                                    forwarded with the communication of June 7.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Marriner</hi>: A case has recently been brought
                            to our notice by our Consul-General in San Francisco of a British
                            subject who, justly or unjustly, was arrested and fined by the Oakland
                            authorities for a disturbance of the peace.</p>
                        <p>Such cases are presumably of fairly frequent occurrence and would not as
                            a general rule be of any particular interest to us, but it so happens
                            that the transgressor happened to be an official of the International
                            Labour Office of the League of Nations who was on his way to Australia
                            on leave and who, in the course of his journey, subsequently attended
                            the second session of the Institute of Pacific Relations at Honolulu as
                            an observer of the International Labour Office.</p>
                        <p>In the course of certain complaints lodged with the Consulate-General,
                            the offender—or victim, as the case may have been—who had with him a
                            card of identification signed by the Director of the International
                            Labour Office, raised the question of his right to “the diplomatic
                            privileges and immunities” accorded to officials of the League of
                            Nations under the Covenant. He did not, however, attempt to press the
                            matter at the time of his arrest.</p>
                        <p>I should be very glad to have your views as to what privileges officials
                            of the League of Nations are entitled to in this country. I understand
                            that in certain circumstances League Officials are granted diplomatic
                            visas by the United States Government, but as far as I am aware the
                            extent of such privileges has never been defined.</p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Chilton</hi>: I beg to refer to your letter of
                            September 28, 1927, in which you request to be informed regarding the
                            privileges officials of the League of Nations are entitled to in this
                            country. You state that you understand in certain circumstances League
                            officials are granted diplomatic visas by the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>As you are doubtless aware, under customary International Law diplomatic
                            privileges and immunities are only conferred upon a well defined class
                            of persons, namely those who are sent by one State to another on
                            diplomatic missions. Officials of the League of Nations are not, as
                            such, considered by the Department to be entitled to such privileges and
                            immunities under generally accepted principles of International Law but
                            only under special provisions of the Covenant of the League which can
                            have no force in countries not members of the League.</p>
                        <p>In the estimation of this Department the executive authorities of this
                            Government would not be warranted, under our law which is declaratory of
                            International Law, in according to officials of the League of Nations
                            diplomatic privileges and immunities in the United States since such
                            persons are not comprehended in the definition of diplomatic officers
                            contained in our Statutes.</p>
                        <p>I may add that such an official would customarily be given a diplomatic
                            visa on the basis of his diplomatic passport and accorded the courtesies
                            usually extended to holders of such passports. You will appreciate the
                            fact, however, that no assurance can be given that such a visa would be
                            regarded as entitling the holder to the privileges and immunities of a
                            diplomatic officer provided for in the laws of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with the request made in
                            your note of January 19,<note n="55" xml:id="d294fn55">Not
                                printed.</note> I have the honor to inform you as follows concerning
                            the exemption <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0501"/>from taxation and
                            customs duties enjoyed by foreign diplomatic and consular officers in
                            the United States;</p>
                        <p>Ambassadors and Ministers accredited to the United States and the members
                            of their households, including secretaries, attaches, and servants, are
                            exempted from the payment of Federal income tax upon their salaries,
                            fees and wages, and upon the income derived by them from investments in
                            the United States in stocks and bonds and from interest on bank balances
                            in the United States. The income derived from any business carried on by
                            them in the United States would, however, be taxable.</p>
                        <p>Property in the District of Columbia owned by foreign governments for
                            Embassy and Legation purposes is exempt from general and special taxes
                            or assessments. Property owned by an Ambassador or Minister and used for
                            Embassy or Legation purposes is exempt from general taxes but not from
                            special assessments for improvements. The payment of water rent is
                            required in all cases, as this is not regarded as a tax but the sale of
                            a commodity.</p>
                        <p>Under a recent ruling of the Treasury Department of the United States all
                            foreign consular officers and the employees of foreign consulates in the
                            United States who are nationals of the State appointing them, on the
                            basis of reciprocity, are exempted from the payment of Federal income
                            taxes on the salaries, fees and wages received by them in compensation
                            for their consular services.</p>
                        <p>The taxes on the sale of automobiles and jewelry provided for in Sections
                            600 and 604 of the Revenue Act of 1924<note n="56" xml:id="d294fn56">43
                                Stat. 258.</note> are taxes imposed upon the manufacturers of
                            automobiles and upon the vendors of jewelry. In the collection of such
                            taxes the Government looks to the manufacturer and to the vendor for the
                            payment of the tax and not to the purchasers of the articles. For this
                            reason and the further reason that the price of the article sold is a
                            matter of negotiation between the vendor and the purchasers, the
                            appropriate authorities of this Government have taken the position that
                            no exemption from the payment of these taxes can be granted to the
                            manufacturer or vendor by reason of the fact that the sale is made to a
                            diplomatic representative of a foreign government.</p>
                        <p>The members of foreign diplomatic missions and foreign consular officers
                            in the District of Columbia are exempt in the District from the payment
                            of personal property taxes on automobiles and other personal property,
                            either tangible or intangible, owned by them. They are furnished
                            identification tags and operators’ permits for their automobiles,
                            without charge, provided the applications made therefor bear the seal of
                            the mission and the seal of the Department of State. It is understood
                            that automobiles bearing District of Columbia tags are <pb n="416"
                                xml:id="pg_416" facs="0502"/>permitted to enter the several States
                            without obtaining additional tags. Members of foreign diplomatic
                            missions in the United States and foreign consular officers stationed in
                            the District of Columbia are accordingly not required to pay the fees
                            ordinarily charged other owners of automobiles in this country.</p>
                        <p>The fees and taxes for automobiles and other property to be charged
                            foreign consuls in the several States of the United States, in the
                            absence of applicable treaty provisions, are subject to regulation by
                            the States in which the consuls are stationed.</p>
                        <p>By an order dated July 8, 1921, the Collector of Taxes of the District of
                            Columbia was authorized to issue dog licenses to foreign legations
                            without charge.</p>
                        <p>Articles 404 and 405 of the United States Customs Regulations of 1923
                            provide for the granting of customs courtesies and the exemption from
                            the payment of customs duties, to diplomatic and consular officers of
                            foreign countries and outline the procedure to be followed by such
                            officers in requesting these courtesies.</p>
                        <p>Under these regulations foreign ambassadors and ministers, and the
                            secretaries and other attaches of foreign embassies and legations, and
                            their families, are entitled to the free admission of their baggage and
                            effects on their arrival in this country, whether they are stationed in
                            the United States or are en route to missions in other countries.
                            Subsequent to their arrival in the United States they are permitted to
                            import, without the payment of duty, merchandise of any characer, if
                            intended for their use or for the use of their families.</p>
                        <p>Foreign consular officers and their families are accorded the privilege
                            of the free entry of their personal and household effects at the time of
                            their arrival in the United States to take up their official duties or
                            upon their return to their posts in the United States after leave of
                            absence. The baggage and effects of foreign consular officers are
                            subject to such scrutiny by customs officers as may be necessary to
                            ascertain whether or not intoxicating liquors or other legally
                            proscribed commodities are contained therein.</p>
                        <p>Supplies intended for official use of foreign embassies and legations and
                            foreign consulates in the United States, such as office furniture and
                            office material, may be entered free of duty. Exhibits of the products
                            of foreign countries, if forming a part of the permanent exhibitions in
                            the consulates may also be admitted free of duty.</p>
                        <p>The granting of these customs exemptions to diplomatic and consular
                            officers of foreign countries is conditional upon the granting of
                            similar exemptions to American diplomatic and consular officers by these
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Any material imported by a foreign government to be used in constructing
                            an embassy or legation building is exempted from the payment of customs
                            duties.</p>
                        <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0503"/>
                        <p>The above statement, although not exhaustive, describes some of the more
                            important immunities and exemptions accorded foreign diplomatic and
                            consular officers in the United States. If information is desired in
                            regard to any particular immunity or exemption not referred to herein,
                            the matter will, upon request, be given further consideration.</p>

                            note of January 14, 1927, asking if the laws of the United States
                            restrict in any way the right of foreign governments to own
                            property.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State has the honor to inform the Chargé d’Affaires ad
                            interim of Egypt that the Government of the United States places no
                            restrictions on the owning of property for Embassy or Legation purposes
                            by foreign governments in the District of Columbia. It may be stated,
                            however, that real property in the District of Columbia is subject in
                            general to the laws of real property in force in the District
                            notwithstanding that it may be owned by a foreign government.</p>

                        <p>The Commissioners of the District of Columbia have informed the
                            Department that the following rules regarding exemption from taxation
                            under international usage have been adopted by the Commissioner under
                            the advice of the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Property owned by foreign governments and used for legation
                                    purposes is exempt from general and special taxes or
                                    assessments. Property owned by a minister and used for legation
                                    purposes is exempt from general taxes but not from special
                                    assessments for improvements.”</p>

                            (1) Ambassadors, Ministers, and officers of the Foreign Service of the
                            United States; (2) officers of the United States Army; (3) officers of

                            secretary. Military and Naval attachés take precedence as between
                            themselves according to their respective grades and seniority
                            therein.</p>

                        <p>At ceremonies and receptions where diplomatic missions are present as a
                            body, the Military, Naval and Commercial attaches will form distinct
                            groups, and follow in that order the diplomatic personnel of the

                            replace the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1853
                            originally entered into between the Government of the United States and

                                xml:id="d299fn6">Not printed.</note> of the attitude adopted by
                            various South American countries towards this subject. The Embassy had
                            made various oral requests of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs relative
                            to the development of Argentine opinion upon the advisability of
                            entering into negotiations for such a Treaty. The utter failure of the
                            legal division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to place the question
                            upon its proper basis is set forth in Embassy’s Despatch No. 351 of July
                            27, 1927.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn7">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Embassy is now in receipt of a note with an enclosed protocol from
                            the Ministry for Foreign Affairs dated September 8, a copy and
                            translation of which are transmitted herewith. The salient features
                            appear: 1, the reference to the reported visit of American Commissioners
                            to investigate the cost of production (of flaxseed and corn, is to be
                            understood), and 2, the desire of the Argentine Government to sign a
                            protocol allowing either party signatory to the Treaty of 1853 to
                            denounce that Treaty at any time upon a notification of six months.</p>
                        <p>The appended protocol should be taken, I believe, as an indication that
                            the Argentine Government is not at this moment desirous of entering into
                            negotiations for a new Treaty containing an unconditional <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0508"/>most-favored-nation clause. Their
                            expressed wish to place in the Treaty of 1853 an addition granting this
                            right of denunciation might prove detrimental to the United States,
                            should it be ratified, inasmuch as it would provide an avenue of attack
                            to those nations which are in active commercial competition with the
                            United States, by enabling foreign pressure to bring about an abrogation
                            of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to call the Department’s attention to the Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 372 of August 18, 1927,<note n="4" xml:id="d299fn4">Not

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chargé d’affaires</hi>: As I had the
                                pleasure of informing the Embassy under your worthy charge in my
                                note of December 2 last, my Government has considered with the
                                greatest care the American proposal of September 17 with reference
                                to the negotiation of a new Treaty of Commerce between the United
                                States and the Republic.</p>
                            <p>The desire of the American Government to direct its commercial policy
                                in accordance with modern principles is shared by the Argentine
                                Government. Without doubt you know the statements which the
                                commercial and industrial organizations of Argentina have made on
                                separate occasions requesting a complete revision of our system of
                                treaties, which according to these petitions should begin with the
                                general denunciation of all the conventions now in force.</p>
                            <p>The legislature has supported these desires of the public and in
                                obedience thereto has appointed a parliamentary commission whose
                                duty it is to study the conventions now in force and to give advice
                                with respect either to the approval or alteration of the principles
                                upon which they are based. Although the commission has not at this
                                date rendered a definite report, the Executive Power believes that,
                                whatever may be its future decision, the moment has arrived to
                                prepare the ground for the modifications which will certainly be <pb

                                create the diplomatic resources which would provide the means to
                                readjust the treaties questioned by public opinion and fortunately
                                rejected even from a theoretical standpoint, as inefficient and
                                obsolete, by certain of the contracting States with whom we are
                                bound by them, as for example in the present instance by the
                                American Foreign Office, which offers the new formula referred to in
                                the above mentioned note of September 17, 1926.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing and with the desire to obviate unavoidable
                                differences of interpretation which the new forms of international
                                commerce and its official control might advance with respect to the
                                enforcement of the Treaty of Commerce of 1853, as for instance, the
                                opinion which I presented to the Embassy under your worthy charge in
                                the Memorandum of July 19 last, with reference to the reported visit
                                to the Republic of an American commission to investigate the cost of
                                production, I have the pleasure to request you to enquire of your
                                Government the views which it might entertain in regard to the
                                signing of an additional protocol similar to the one which
                                accompanies this note.</p>

                        <p>39. Press announces President by Cabinet resolution has directed the
                            expenditure of 32,000,000 gold pesos for construction of two cruisers,
                            three submarines, two destroyers and two gunboats. Funds apparently to
                            be taken from unexpended balance alleged to have been left over after
                            purchase of naval units appropriated for in 1909. Constitutionality of
                            President’s authorizing this and other large expenditures without
                            approval of Congress now in recess is seriously questioned. Naval
                            attaché is following developments closely and will continue to keep Navy
                            Department informed. Representative of Fore River Shipbuilding
                            Corporation arrived here recently on this matter and will continue to
                            receive all proper assistance from Embassy.</p>

                            Electric Boat Company of New York is competing before an Argentine
                            Commission in Paris for an order for three submarine torpedo boats of
                            about nine hundred tons each. It is proposed to build them at works of
                            Cockerill Company in Belgium but from designs and under superintendence
                            of Electric Boat Company which would also furnish certain parts.</p>
                        <p>Strong foreign competition is reported. You should seek an early
                            opportunity informally to request the appropriate authorities that
                            American firms be given an equal chance to compete for this business and
                            that their offers receive consideration equal to that accorded any other
                            foreign companies.</p>

                        <p>63. Department’s telegram 36, September 9, 6 p.m. I have taken up
                            informally but actively with Minister for Foreign Affairs competition
                            for submarines. He assures me our bids will receive equal opportunity
                            and be examined strictly on their merits regardless of any foreign
                            political considerations. Minister who was most friendly did not deny my
                            tentative suggestion that Italian Government was pressing matter, but
                            repeated his assurances that no favoritism would be shown.</p>
                        <p>I had just heard former Italian naval attaché here was attached to chief
                            of Argentine Naval Mission in Europe during latter’s visit to Italy and
                            followed him on his further journeys. Also learned Italian Embassy here
                            has urged building of submarines in Italy.</p>
                        <p>Our naval attaché will take first opportunity for appropriate action with
                            the Ministry of Marine.</p>

                        <p>41. Referring to your telegram No. 63 of September 11, 9 a.m., and
                            particularly to the statements concerning American bids which were made
                            to you by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I now understand that the
                            Government of Argentina is on the point of awarding contracts for the
                            construction of two destroyers, three submarines, and two cruisers
                            amounting in all to about 12½ million dollars, and that a new program
                            for 95 million dollars is also contemplated. I am informed that
                            heretofore most of this work has been done for Argentina by the
                            Bethlehem Steel and Shipbuilding Company and in an entirely satisfactory
                            manner. I am further informed that it is not the intention of the
                            Government of Argentina to give any opportunity to that company or to
                            other American shipbuilders to bid, but that business is being carried
                            on with Italy, England, and France exclusively. Because of the attitude
                            which I have always taken in not raising objection to and, as a matter
                            of fact, in encouraging American bankers to lend money to Argentina, and
                            because of the relations which exist between the two Governments, I feel
                            very strongly that <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0512"/>Argentina
                            should grant American shipbuilders an equal opportunity to bid on and
                            receive these contracts. Kindly present this subject informally, but in
                            no uncertain terms, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and any other
                            authorities you deem best.</p>

                                printed.</note> which was mailed on October 7, should reach the
                            Department within a few days. In it was enclosed a translation of the
                            new naval appropriation act finding an expenditure of 75 million
                            Argentine gold pesos to be spread over the next 10 years.</p>
                        <p>As was mentioned therein, the Minister of Marine, when I approached him,
                            told me that American shipbuilders such as Fore River and Cramps were
                            being requested to make tenders in common with European competitors.</p>
                        <p>I do not understand the situation which the local agent of the Bethlehem
                            Steel Corporation described as having been managed in a hurried and
                            furtive manner inasmuch as I consider the Minister of Marine to be
                            personally most friendly to the United States. However, I will
                            immediately and actively take the matter up with the Foreign Minister
                            and advise the Department by telegraph.</p>

                        <p>77. Embassy’s telegram No. 76, dated October 19, noon. The naval attaché
                            by exertive friendship with the Minister of Marine this morning learned
                            the following:</p>
                        <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0513"/>
                        <p>In August the Ministry of Marine telegraphed Johnston of the Bethlehem
                            Steel Company to contact the Argentine Naval Mission in New York. The
                            Minister of Marine read cablegrams from Admiral Galindez, chief of the
                            Naval Mission in Europe, quoting bids from Cramps and New York
                            Shipbuilding Company. I make the suggestion that Department verify the
                            above. The Minister of Marine added that the Argentine Mission in the
                            United States had been instructed last week once more to ask tenders
                            from Bethlehem. In view of the above I shall not make further
                            representations to the Government of Argentina unless the Department
                            instructs me otherwise. At official luncheon today I found opportunity
                            to express both to the Foreign Minister and to the Minister of Marine my
                            confidence that American interests will receive equal treatment.</p>

                                for Naval Construction</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Knowlton stated that the Argentine Government was in course of
                            realizing a naval program calling for an expenditure of some 75 million
                            dollars over a period of years; that it was now contemplated to raise a
                            loan of 15 million dollars to finance the building of certain vessels;
                            that the bonds in question would be six per cent bonds, with a one per
                            cent cumulative sinking fund running for thirty-three years.</p>
                        <p>The business had been brought to the attention of the International
                            Acceptance Bank through the Argentine branch of the French firm of Louis
                            Dreyfus. I inquired where the proposed naval construction would be
                            carried out. Mr. Knowlton stated that he did not know definitely, but
                            that there had been some discussion of having part, at least, done in
                            France or Italy. Mr. Knowlton would be prepared to specify that a part
                            of the construction be carried out in the United States. He inquired
                            whether the Department would desire a preference for American firms. I
                            replied that it is not the ordinary practice of the Department to
                            suggest any preference, but that we always hoped that in the case of
                            construction work of any sort American firms would have the fullest
                            opportunity to compete freely, and that as to construction work in
                            general the Department was always glad to see the work done by American
                            firms. Mr. Knowlton stated that he would be prepared in any case to
                            stipulate that American firms <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0514"
                            />should have the fullest and freest opportunity to compete for any
                            proposed work.</p>
                        <p>In reply to his inquiry whether the Department would object to a loan for
                            naval construction by Argentina, as such, I stated that I was not
                            prepared to express any views without consideration, but that I would
                            take up the matter promptly and communicate with him.</p>

                        <p>I called Mr. Knowlton on the telephone and referred to his conversation
                            with Dr. Young, particularly to his statement to Dr. Young that he would
                            be prepared to stipulate that American firms have the fullest and freest
                            opportunity to compete for any proposed work. In the event, I said, that
                            Mr. Knowlton should write us a formal letter and state that such a
                            stipulation had been made and that an equal opportunity would be
                            accorded American firms to bid, the Department would reply stating that
                            it would have no objection to the proposed financing. I might add also
                            that the Department of course would be very glad to see some of the work
                            go to American firms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Knowlton stated that since his conversation with Dr. Young he had
                            telegraphed to his representatives in Buenos Aires inquiring whether
                            American firms would be accorded a free and equal opportunity to bid.
                            The reply had been unsatisfactory, stating that no such assurance would
                            be given. Mr. Knowlton said that he would telegraph again and make his
                            inquiry clear. There might have been some misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I would be glad to have him do so. It seemed to me
                            impossible that such a stipulation would not be granted by the Argentine
                            Government. I also stated that it was the Department’s practice in
                            connection with loans the proceeds of which were to be used for
                            construction work to ask that the bankers concerned should see that
                            there was nothing in the contract which would preclude American concerns
                            from bidding for the work in question. Mr. Knowlton stated that he would
                            let me know what further reply he received from the Argentine.</p>

                        <p>9. Bethlehem Steel Company states that further difficulties are being
                            encountered in getting contracts for Argentine naval construction. It
                            appears that contracts are to be awarded to Italy for cruisers, to
                            England for fast destroyers and to France for submarines. It is stated
                            that although the bids of the Bethlehem Steel Company were higher than
                            those of foreign competitors the Argentine Government has hitherto
                            always found this added expense justified by superior workmanship. If
                            contracts were awarded to lowest bidder all would go to Italy whereas
                            company considers that they are evidently to be divided for political
                            reasons between Italy, England, and France. It seems to be the intention
                            nevertheless to finance this construction in the United States. The
                            Company points out that other countries have taken the position that
                            when they make loans in similar circumstances their nationals must
                            receive the contracts.</p>
                        <p>If you are satisfied that the foregoing information regarding the
                            allocation of the construction in question is substantially correct, and
                            that there has been in fact an unwarranted discrimination against
                            American interests, particularly if margin by which British and French
                            bids exceed Italian bid is comparable to margin by which American bid
                            exceeds the Italian bid, you may express to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs the hope of this Government that an equitable share will be
                            accorded to American firms. You may add that if it is contemplated to
                            arrange for the necessary financing in this market it would undoubtedly
                            give rise to difficulties unless at least a fair share of the
                            construction should be placed here. See the next to the last sentence of
                            the Department’s cablegram 41, October 18, 1 p.m., and instruction 117

                        <p>27. Department’s telegram No. 11, dated March 9. During an interview with
                            the Foreign Minister on March 4, I informed him of the attitude set
                            forth in Department’s 9, March 1. The Foreign Minister said that as yet
                            President Alvear had signed no contract, but that he would not fail to
                            invite the attention of the President and Minister of Marine to the
                            substance of our conversation. Since the Government has been informed of
                            the attitude of the United States, it does not appear for the present
                            that any further steps can be taken. Mr. Hill, the vice president of the
                            Bethlehem Steel Company, who is now here, is fully aware of all measures
                            taken by the Embassy.</p>

                            1927, 3 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] p.m., and subsequent correspondence
                            relative to the purchase by the Argentine Government of various naval
                            units comprised in the forthcoming naval programme authorized by this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The situation at present I understand is as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Bethlehem Steel Company has been unsuccessful in arriving at an
                            understanding with the Argentine Government. This may be put down to
                            several reasons, the primary one of which is the cost of manufacture in
                            the United States. It has been decided, and this is from an
                            authoritative source, that the light cruisers will be built in <pb
                                n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0517"/>Italy and the flotilla leaders
                            in Great Britain. The building programme has not been completely
                            contracted for so that there is an opportunity of Bethlehem coming to an
                            understanding either for future units or possibly destroyers.</p>
                        <p>I am led to understand that the allegations made by the American
                            companies some four months ago are not without foundation, as it was the
                            original intention of Admiral Domecq Garcia, the Minister of Marine, and
                            Admiral Galindez, who is Chief of the Naval Mission in Europe, to award
                            the complete construction to Italy. … Pressure brought to bear on the
                            basis of the slogan “Buy from those who buy from you” brought about the
                            tentative awarding of the flotilla leaders to Great Britain. From what I
                            understand, Admiral Garcia has done and will do everything possible to
                            keep any portion of the plan from American builders.</p>
                        <p>The Electric Boat Company stands in a rather stronger position than the
                            Bethlehem Steel Company in view of the fact that a Commission formed
                            prior to the awarding of any contracts reported that the double-hulled
                            boats of the <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> type were far in advance of
                            any type constructed in Europe and should be adopted for the Argentine
                            Navy. President Alvear, with his well-known feeling for France, desired
                            the submarines to be built there, and it is possible that the Electric
                            Boat Company, which has licensees in that country, may adopt the plan of
                            constructing them abroad under the American patents in order to
                            conciliate his point of view.</p>
                        <p>I have recently been informed that Admiral Garcia proposed to the
                            Minister of Finance that the debt of $20,000,000 which France owes to
                            Argentina should be utilized by the construction of naval units in that
                            country, and suggested that four submarines at present practically
                            completed in France should be considered as part payment. I understand
                            that the French Government does not wish to release these units which
                            they have constructed for themselves, but have proposed to construct
                            four more. As these would not be of the <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi>
                            type, it would be running contrary to the findings of the Argentine
                            Board on submarines.</p>
                        <p>In my last two interviews with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which
                            I emphasized the point of possible financing in the United States and
                            the feeling of the Department concerning a portion of the construction
                            going to American shipbuilders, I met with absolute silence and a
                            statement that the question was entirely in the hands of the Minister of
                            Marine and President Alvear to whose attention he had called the matter,
                            and that he could do nothing further.</p>

                        <p>38. Embassy’s telegram No. 27, dated March 10. Although no contracts have
                            been signed up to the present time, yet it may be stated with confidence
                            that Italy will secure the light cruisers and England the sloops and
                            flotilla leaders. It is said that the French Government will construct
                            the submarines. I have pointed out to the Under Secretary that if such
                            should be the case, it would be contrary to the report of the naval
                            board which recommended the <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> type
                            submarines.</p>
                        <p>The Electric Boat Company representative informs me that his company is
                            in a position to construct vessels under its own patents in French
                            yards. This may be the Argentine Government’s plan, since it would
                            satisfy President Alvear’s desire for France to have part of the
                            construction program and it would eliminate the accusation that the
                            United States is being discriminated against.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed that the Government of Argentina has requested
                            tenders for a loan of $15,000,000 in New York and London. Such an amount
                            would cover the units of the present program. The London terms will be
                            accepted if they should be practically as favorable as those of New
                            York.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has been informed by Mr. C.
                            S. McNeir, Washington representative of the Electric Boat Company of
                            Groton, Connecticut, that his principals have virtually succeeded in
                            obtaining a contract for the construction of three submarines for the
                            Argentine Government. There was strong competition for this business
                            from firms in certain other countries and it is understood that
                            considerable influence was used in their behalf, but the Department was
                            able, through the Embassy at Buenos Aires, to obtain due consideration
                            for the bid of the American company.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that by the terms of the contract the submarines are to be
                            built in France under American patents, and that the matter has reached
                            the point where it is necessary for the Electric Boat Company to come to
                            an agreement with the Argentine Government <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433"
                                facs="0519"/>as to the French yard which is to carry out the
                            construction. The first yard selected by the Electric Boat Company has
                            been rejected on account of alleged lack of experience in the
                            construction of submarines, and it is confidentially stated by Mr.
                            McNeir that the French Government is making recommendations to the
                            Argentine Government as to the yard to be employed.</p>
                        <p>In this situation the Electric Boat Company has instructed its Paris
                            representative, Captain Paul Koster, that it may ultimately be necessary
                            to enlist the support of the French Government with regard to some yard
                            which is considered satisfactory to the company, and has advised him to
                            consult you when that time comes. Should he do so, you are authorized to
                            render him such assistance as may be consistently possible through
                            informal representations to the appropriate French authorities.</p>

                        <p>70. Department’s telegram 26, July 28, 5 p.m. After a consultation with
                            Ribero, had interview with Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
                            stressing Department interest and informed him at Ribero’s suggestion
                            that Electric Boat Company fully capable of completing contract. He
                            stated that he would inquire into the matter and communicate with me
                            informally. So far no reply received.</p>

                        <p>[Paraphrase.] Yesterday I was informed … that it was practically decided
                            to award the contract to an Italian company of Taranto which is operated
                            by Germans. This company constructs double-hulled ships of the same type
                            as the <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> and considered by some to be
                            superior. A report which was submitted by Lieutenant Commander Teisaire
                            of the Naval Mission in Europe, who received his original submarine
                            instruction at the Electric Boat Company’s plant, that this type was
                            preferable for their purposes, has caused the board of Admirals to
                            reverse their original decision. … As yet the contracts have not been
                            let. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>31. Embassy’s telegram No. 70, dated August 9, 5 p.m. You are instructed
                            to request an audience with the President and tell him that the
                            Department, with a desire to insure full and careful consideration of
                            the Electric Boat Company’s proposition, sincerely hopes that no
                            decision will be made until the company has had the opportunity to
                            present evidence of the arrangements made by it in France on the
                            understanding that the matter had been decided virtually in the
                            company’s favor.<note n="10" xml:id="d316fn10">In a letter of Aug. 20,
                                1927, the Electric Boat Co. informed the Department that the
                                Government of Argentina had agreed to postpone the final decision;
                                letter not printed. (File No. 835.34/435.)</note></p>
                        <p>The delay is partly desired in order that the Electric Boat Company may
                            have time to enlist the support of the Government of France. Because of
                            President Alvear’s well-known disposition to favor France, the company
                            believes this may be effective.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 39, of May 21, 1926, and subsequent correspondence
                            concerning the Argentine naval construction program, and, for the
                            Department’s information, to submit the following report concerning the
                            various contracts which have already been let.</p>
                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0521"/>
                        <p>Two scout cruisers, nominally of approximately 8,000 tons, have been
                            awarded to the Orlando Company, at Leghorn, in Italy. The keels of these
                            vessels were laid on October 12. Two destroyer leaders were bought
                            outright from Spain. It is understood that these ships, which are not
                            yet completed, are being constructed in that country by the Sociedad
                            Española de Constructores Navales. The actual, but not nominal, head of
                            this company, which is supposedly a subsidiary of Armstrong and Vickers,
                            is Sir Philip Watts. J. Samuel White and Company, of Cowes, will build
                            three destroyer leaders. Two sloops and two tugs are to be constructed
                            by Hawthorn, Leslie and Company; and the contract for the construction
                            of three submarines has been awarded to Tossi, of Taranto, Italy.</p>
                        <p>The failure so far of the two American concerns most actively engaged in
                            attempting to obtain contracts, i. e., the Electric Boat Company for
                            submarines and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation for other units, may be
                            explained as follows: it would undoubtedly appear that Admiral Domecq
                            Garcia, the Minister of Marine, and Admiral Galindez, Chief of the
                            Argentine Naval Commission in Europe, desired to have the complete naval
                            program constructed in Italy. For various political reasons, however,
                            the British and Spanish naval construction firms received contracts,
                            although I understand that it was distinctly against naval opinion to
                            purchase the two flotilla leaders from Spain. I am also led to believe
                            that Sir Malcolm Robertson, the British Ambassador, interested himself
                            extremely in the allotment of the various units to Great Britain and
                            pointed out that as his country is Argentina’s best customer, and the
                            largest ship-building nation in the world, it should receive due
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Even before presenting my letters of credence, I had a conversation with
                            Dr. Gallardo, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the
                            Electric Boat Company, recommending to the earnest consideration of the
                            Argentine Naval authorities its proposition to build three submarines in
                            France for the Argentine Navy. Before his departure for Europe, I talked
                            with him again on the subject and also took it up later with Dr.
                            Sagarna, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and with Admiral Domecq
                            Garcia, the Minister of Marine.</p>
                        <p>In view of the letting of the contract to the Tossi Company, I personally
                            do not believe that the Electric Boat Company have any further
                            opportunity of obtaining the units which are to be constructed in the
                            future, unless they should adopt different means of approach.</p>
                        <p>As far as it has been possible to learn, the bid made by the Electric
                            Boat Company exceeded that of the Tossi Company. It has been reported
                            that Signor Mussolini, at the request of the head of the <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0522"/>Argentine Naval Commission in Europe,
                            intervened with the Italian company, with the result that its price for
                            the submarines was reduced from £218,000 to £208,000 for each
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>The Bethlehem Steel Corporation have, I believe, a fair chance to gain
                            the contract for the four river gunboats, inasmuch as Mr. Hill, Vice
                            President of the Corporation, who is now in Buenos Aires, has made a
                            tender which has appealed to the Argentine Government. He has offered to
                            assemble one of these units in Argentina, with Argentine workmen, only
                            the direction to be controlled by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. As
                            this would be the first naval unit of any importance to be built in
                            South America, it would naturally be a subject of local pride, and there
                            is a reasonable expectation, therefore, that the Bethlehem Steel
                            Corporation will be able to obtain the contract by this means.</p>
                        <p>The appropriation calls for $35,000,000 gold to be spent during the first
                            three years, $20,000,000 during the next three, and $20,000,000 during
                            the last four. Of the complete program there remain to be ordered one
                            light cruiser, one destroyer leader, three submarines and various
                            smaller craft for river work which are not specifically named in the
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not American firms will be able to obtain orders for these
                            units depends principally upon whether they can reduce their cost of
                            production sufficiently to enable them to approximate the prices of
                            their European rivals.</p>

                        <p>The most embarrassing feature of these regulations is centred in the
                            experience of Australians who enter for the purpose of extending their
                            financial, commercial and industrial activities, and which are usually
                            of mutual benefit to Australia and the United States.</p>
                        <p>It may be pointed out that American citizens are free to enter Australia,
                            and to establish business offices in any part of the Commonwealth. There
                            are no restrictions, and, consequently, full advantage is taken of this
                            opportunity to engage in the ever-increasing trade as between the United
                            States and Australia. One of the many <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438"
                                facs="0524"/>instances which might be cited for the purpose of
                            emphasizing this feature, is the trade in automobiles and motor trucks.
                            Australia today imports more American-made automobiles than any other
                            country in the world, and in this activity alone there are a great many
                            Americans who are engaged in American offices established in
                            Australia.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if an Australian business house desires to extend its
                            operations to the United States, a representative of the firm must enter
                            this country either under (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Australian
                            quota, or (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) as a temporary visitor. The annual
                            quota for Australia is so limited that the opportunity to enter through
                            that channel (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) is denied to many Australian
                            business men. whilst the regulation which classes them as visitors (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) leaves no freedom to establish and maintain
                            proper business offices with continuity of operations by those who are
                            best qualified with a knowledge of the business.</p>
                        <p>It is desired to urge that consideration be given to the wish of the
                            Government of the Commonwealth of Australia that the concessions granted
                            to business men of the United Kingdom, who establish offices in the
                            United States, be extended in like manner to citizens of Australia.</p>
                        <p>The privilege enjoyed by British citizens was made possible under the
                            Treaty between the United States of America and Great Britain,
                            proclaimed on December 22nd, 1815.<note n="1" xml:id="d318fn1">Signed

                            countries. Its purport is that the merchants and traders of Great
                            Britain and the United States shall enjoy the most complete protection
                            and security for their commerce in such a manner as to render the same
                            reciprocal, beneficial and satisfactory. The Treaty definitely limits
                            its operation to “all the Territories of His Britannic Majesty in
                            Europe.” The words “in Europe” isolate Australia, a country virtually
                            unknown (at least in a trading sense) in 1815, when the Treaty was
                            proclaimed as between Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is desired to learn whether (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Government
                            of the United States of America is able, and would be willing, to extend
                            to citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia the privileges granted to
                            British citizens under the Treaty of 1815, or (<hi rend="italic"

                            receipt of a communication, dated January 14, 1927, from the Honorable
                            Hugh R. Denison, Commissioner of Australia, relating to the entry of
                            Australian citizens into the United States, and to a recent discussion
                            of the subject at the Department. Mr. Denison sets forth clearly the
                            present status of Australian business men desiring to extend their
                            commercial affairs in the United States and points out the restrictive
                            features of the Immigration Act of 1924.<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">43

                        <p>He desires to learn whether (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Government of
                            the United States is able, and would be willing to extend to citizens of
                            the Commonwealth of Australia the privileges granted to British citizens
                            under the Treaty of 1815, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), in the event of
                            it not being possible to effect such an extension under that Treaty,
                            would consider the negotiation of a special treaty with the Commonwealth
                            for a similar purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that the Treaty of 1815 with Great Britain
                            relates to trade and commerce with British possessions in Europe and
                            that its provisions are not applicable to any of the component parts of
                            the British Empire overseas.</p>
                        <p>As to the possibility of the negotiation of a treaty with the
                            Commonwealth of Australia for the purposes defined in Mr. Denison’s
                            communication, I beg to invite your attention to the wording of Section
                            3 (6) of the Immigration Act of 1924, which reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“an alien entitled to enter the United States
                                    solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of i a present
                                    existing treaty of commerce and navigation.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>That provision became effective on May 26, 1924, and hence would not
                            apply to a treaty concluded subsequently. In view of this situation I am
                            not prepared at present to discuss this aspect of the subject but the
                            Department is deeply interested and I shall be glad to communicate with
                            you at a later date in regard to it.</p>

                        <p>On December 30, 1926, the Prime Minister of Australia, The Eight
                            Honourable S. M. Bruce, had the honour of an interview with the
                            Secretary of State at Washington, when the question of the disabilities
                            attaching to the entry of Australian business men into the United States
                            outside of the quota was discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was accompanied at that interview by His Excellency

                        <p>At the close of the interview the Honourable the Secretary of State
                            requested that a statement of the position from the Australian point of
                            view should be prepared and sent to him by the Commissioner for
                            Australia.</p>
                        <p>Under date of January 14, 1927, a communication was duly forwarded to the
                            Secretary of State, setting out clearly the position existing at
                            present, and asking (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) whether the Government of
                            the United States of America is able and would be willing to extend to
                            citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia the privileges granted to

                        <p>Subsequent to receipt of this letter the British Ambassador was given to

                            that the Department was not in a position to give a definite opinion
                            thereon until it had been ascertained whether Congress would be prepared
                            to amend Section 3, Clause 6. of the United States Immigration Act of

                            parties in reference to this matter, but a letter has now been received
                            by the Commissioner for Australia from the Prime Minister of the
                            Commonwealth, asking that this matter should be reopened in view of the
                            fact that the officials of the State Department appear to recognise that
                            Australia in this matter is under a disability that should be removed as
                            early as possible.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the annual quota for Australia, which is at
                            present the only means by which Australian business men may enter the
                            United States for any extended period in connection with their business,
                            only numbers a hundred and twenty-one and is at the present time filled
                            by applicants for at least two years ahead.</p>
                        <p>It should be further noted that business between the United States of
                            America and Australia is steadily increasing from year to year, and now
                            amounts to very considerably over 250 million dollars per annum.</p>
                        <p>There is no restriction of any kind on American business men entering the
                            Commonwealth of Australia and staying in that country as long as may be
                            necessary for them to conduct and complete their business; and at the
                            present time there are considerably over one thousand American citizens
                            resident in the Commonwealth of Australia taking part in such business
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>It is now desired to learn whether there is any possibility of this
                            matter being brought before Congress during the session about to
                            commence, with a view of obtaining some amendment of the Immigration Act
                            of 1924 which will permit Australian business men to enter for bone fide
                            business purposes without restriction as to the length of their stay in
                            the United States, and also whether any further information is required
                            from Australia in connection with this matter.</p>

                            observed, I have the honor to report, that I anticipated that during the
                            second half of 1927 the Federal Government would seek to float another
                            loan for strictly productive investment purposes. This prophecy is now
                            in the process of fulfillment. I do not cite it as an evidence of
                            perspicacity. The facts upon which it was based were more or less common

                        <p rend="flushleft">There have been persistent rumors that the Chancellor
                            will go to Geneva to attend the September League meeting in connection
                            with the new loan. He tells me today that the rumor is unfounded. He at
                            no time has considered such a possibility. He is going to Germany very
                            shortly to deliver some lectures, to be absent about a week, but
                            Switzerland is not on his itinerary. Dr. Schüller, of the Foreign
                            Office, who is now in Switzerland on leave, will be in Geneva and it is
                            considered quite probable that he will undertake to discuss the matter
                            of a new federal loan with the Financial Committee of the League and
                            seek to enlist its cooperation or goodwill. The Austrian Control
                            Committee <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0529"/>will meet in the
                            middle of October in London and there the serious work will really
                            begin. Minister of Finance Kienböck will be on hand. The Chancellor
                            tells me that he is not yet decided whether he will go or not.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the Control Committee will be sympathetic, as it is hoped,
                            the next appeal will be to the Reparation Commission and to the relief
                            credit States. In my despatch No. 1037 of May 10th, 1926,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d321fn3">Not printed.</note> I enclosed the Joint Resolution
                            of Congress, approved April 6th, 1922,<note n="4" xml:id="d321fn4">42
                                Stat. 491.</note> authorizing for a period not to exceed twenty-five
                            years the extension of the time for the payment of the principal and
                            interest of the debt incurred by Austria for the purchase of flour from
                            the United States Grain Corporation. I also enclosed the notice of the
                            action of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the authority
                            conferred under this Resolution and the relevant Decision of the
                            Reparation Commission, No. 2400. In this connection the question may
                            presently arise as to what affirmative action must be taken by the
                            United States as one of the relief credit nations in order to facilitate
                            a new Austrian federal loan. In the event it should be deemed advisable
                            to take any action whatever, will a new enabling act of Congress be
                            necessary or may the Secretary of the Treasury, under authority of the
                            Joint Resolution herein-before referred to, subordinate the lien of the
                            Austrian Relief Bond Series B of 1920, issued to and held by the United
                            States of America on account of food purchased from the United States
                            Grain Corporation for relief purposes, to a new Austrian federal loan
                            providing said new loan matures within the twenty-five year period
                            mentioned in the Joint Resolution, No. 460 of April 6th, 1922? I may say
                            that it is proposed that the new loan shall mature within this period
                            just mentioned.</p>
                        <p>As to the amount of the new loan, assuming that the necessary permission
                            can be obtained, I find on reference to my despatch No. 1076 of June
                            16th, 1926,<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn5">Not printed.</note> that an
                            additional loan of 200,000,000 schillings was then contemplated. The new
                            investment program is more ambitious. It is proposed not only to
                            continue the electrification of the railroads, which is now underway,
                            and the further extension of underground cables for telephones, but also
                            to reconstruct federal public highways, which are in a bad state of
                            repair, and to extend quasi-public utility agricultural enterprises,
                            such as dairies. For this program, the Chancellor tells me that it is
                            hoped to secure a new loan approximating ninety million dollars. The
                            details will be worked out between now and the middle of October for
                            presentation to the Austrian Control Committee and as soon as available
                            I will forward them to the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>I get the impression that the actual loan flotation will hardly be
                            attempted before the spring of 1928. Many hurdles must be taken.
                            Meanwhile, as has been intimated to me on several occasions recently,
                            the Austrian Government would greatly appreciate it if the competent law
                            officers of the American Government would investigate in a preliminary
                            way the question as to what action is necessary by the United States to
                            subordinate its existing lien to a contemplated new Austrian federal
                            loan for the purposes indicated. It is assumed, of course, that other
                            creditor nations will take favorable action. The outstanding external
                            reconstruction loan, to which the United States has already subordinated
                            its lien, is in the amount of $130,000,000.</p>

                            10 a.m., I have the honor to report that the Chancellor asks me
                            officially and urgently to lay before my Government the request of the
                            Austrian Government for an early answer to the question as to what
                            action is necessary for the United States to subordinate its relief
                            credit lien to a proposed new Austrian Federal Loan.</p>

                            <item>Will a new enabling act of Congress be necessary to enable the
                                Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, to take the desired
                                action?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These queries are propounded on pages 3 and 4 of my despatch No. 1508 of
                            the 30th ultimo, to which reference is hereby made.</p>
                        <p>The reason for the Chancellor’s urgency is this: It seems to be
                            confidently anticipated that favorable action will be taken by the
                            Austrian Control Committee, which is scheduled to meet in London on
                            October 11. Speedy action seems also to be awaited from the Reparations
                            Commission. It is further my understanding, confirmed by the Chancellor,
                            that the Relief Credit states, save the United States, have established
                            a Relief Credit Committee composed in the main of their accredited
                            ambassadors and ministers in London,<note n="7" xml:id="d323fn7">See
                                    <ref target="frus1924v01#pg_127"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1924, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, pp.
                                    127</ref> ff.</note> and it seems to be expected that this
                            Committee will act as a unit, and with a minimum of delay. These three
                            organs just mentioned are referred to on page two of my despatch under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>If the Secretary of the Treasury has ample authority to act under the
                            Joint Resolution of April 6, 1922, the Austrian Government will seek a
                            twenty year loan to bring it within the twenty-five year period
                            mentioned in the Congressional Joint Resolution. If further
                            Congressional action be necessary, the Austrian Government will seek a
                            thirty year loan. It therefore greatly desires to have its proposals
                            definitely matured and ready for submission first to the Austrian
                            Control Committee around the middle of October. In other words, its
                            election for a twenty or thirty year bond term will hinge upon the
                            answer to the question as to whether or not the Secretary of the
                            Treasury may act under the Joint Resolution of April 6, 1922. It is
                            recognized here that an application to Congress for a new enabling act
                            would inevitably involve a delay which it is desired to avoid if
                            possible. All this, of course, is predicated upon the theory that the
                            other interested creditor nations enumerated in the proviso of the
                            before mentioned Joint Resolution, in so far as their assent is now
                            necessary, will take early favorable action. I am told that no
                            difficulties are anticipated and that the way has been already prepared.
                            In any event the attitude of the other creditor states will presently be
                            disclosed. There is a little anxiety here, inasmuch as separate action
                            must be taken by the United States, lest delay in Washington may result
                            in Austria not being able to float a loan at the most propitious moment.
                            It is represented to me that M. Dubois, the Swiss Chairman of the
                            Finance Committee of the League, has intimated to Austrian experts <pb
                                n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0532"/>that he has already broken
                            ground with the firm of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., and there is a feeling
                            of optimism here that the Morgan firm is disposed to take a large
                            participation share in the flotation syndicate to be formed. I am not in
                            a position to express an opinion as to whether this optimism is
                            justified. I do know that the Austrian Minister at London, Baron Georg
                            Franckenstein, is about to go to the United States as a guest of members
                            of the Morgan firm (Messrs. Morgan and Lamont, as the Chancellor tells
                            me). The story, as I hear it, is that Mr. Montagu Norman<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d323fn8">Governor of the Bank of England.</note> …
                            established contacts for him with Mr. Morgan and his partners. The
                            invitation followed. The Austrian Minister sails tomorrow, I believe,
                            for a three weeks’ visit, and will be in the United States at an
                            opportune moment around the middle of October, when it is anticipated
                            that the necessary sanctions will have been obtained or assured.
                            Franckenstein, so Dr. Seipel informs me, does not go to the United
                            States with any power of attorney whatever. There have been printed
                            reports this last week (the <hi rend="italic">Stunde</hi> had an article
                            on Thursday the 15th, and the <hi rend="italic">Neues Wiener
                                Journal</hi> on Friday the 16th) to the effect that an “Austrian
                            personality”, whose identity does not seem to have been discovered, is
                            about to sound the big New York banks in the matter of a federal loan.
                            The <hi rend="italic">Neues Wiener Journal</hi> says that negotiations
                            are pending for a 120 million dollar loan for Austria, a 50 million
                            dollar loan for Bulgaria and a 45 million dollar loan for Greece.</p>

                        <p>This exhibit can hardly be further profitably summarized, but it should
                            prove a useful aid to the State and Treasury in passing upon questions
                            relating to the new proposed loan. It will perhaps be helpful in any
                            exhaustive study of this matter, to compare annex I (Expose of the
                            Austrian Federal Household for the year[s] 1923–27) with some of the
                            tables given in my despatch No. 1120 of July 31, 1926,<note n="10"

                            Control. Exhibit 1 is so far a confidential document. It is not desired
                            that any publicity be given <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0533"/>to
                            it before it has been submitted to the Austrian Control Committee. I
                            have supplied a copy of it to the Commercial Attaché, and he will
                            presumably forward it for the information of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>At the present moment it has not yet been decided whether the investment
                            program will provisionally extend for three years or five years. The
                            plan is drawn to cover a period of five years. It is proposed that the
                            bonds be issued in annual instalments to cover the year’s need. If the
                            entire loan can presently be floated at a favorable interest rate for a
                            five year period, this course will be followed. On the other hand, if
                            the conditions of emission are not altogether favorable, the program
                            will be curtailed to provide provisionally for three years only, with
                            the thought of securing later on better terms for the needs of 1931 and
                            1932.</p>

                            officially and urgently asked him to telegraph requesting an early reply
                            to his request reported on pages three and four of the Minister’s
                            despatch No. 1508 of August 30; namely, that the competent law officers
                            of the American Government should investigate in a preliminary way the
                            question as to what action is necessary by the United States to
                            subordinate its existing lien to a contemplated new Austrian Federal
                            loan. The Minister added that in a despatch dated September 20 he was
                            reporting the detailed reasons for the Chancellor’s request which are
                            connected with the meeting of the Control Committee in London on October

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With further reference to my telegram No.
                            54 of September 20, 10 a.m., and my despatch No. 1532 of the same date,
                            I now have the honor to enclose the original, with copies, of a
                            communication received on the 14th instant from the Chancellor,
                            embodying a formal request to the Government of the United States of
                            America to grant the suspension of the lien and the postponement up to
                            the 31st of December, 1957, of the payments due for the Relief Credit
                            accorded to Austria in the amount of about 24 million dollars, plus
                            interest. It will be observed that the request is for a thirty-year
                            suspension, which would of course require congressional sanction.
                            Nevertheless Dr. Schüller told me the day before his departure for
                            London that whilst he proposed to proceed upon the theory that the new
                            bond issue would mature in thirty years yet it still remained true that
                            if it were found that our Secretary of the Treasury could act without
                            further authority under the Joint Resolution of April 6, 1922, he would
                            strongly urge that negotiations be conducted on the twenty-year
                            basis.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The “Comité de Contrôle des
                                Etats garants pour la reconstruction de l’Autriche” (Committee of
                                Control of the Guarantor States for the Reconstruction of Austria)
                                have at the request of the Austrian Government consented in their
                                meeting held in London on October 12th, 1927, to the conclusion on
                                the part of the Austrian Republic of an investments loan to yield an
                                amount of 725 million Schillings.</p>
                            <p>This decision was based on a statement of the Austrian Government on
                                Austrian revenue and expenditure during the years 1923–1927; on the
                                sums required for capital expenditure (investments) from 1928 to
                                1932; and on the actual state and the use made of the Austrian
                                Government Guaranteed Loan 1923–1943. I have the honour to annex to
                                these presents three copies of the said statement for
                                information.</p>
                            <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0535"/>
                            <p>The following points of the contents of the statement seem to me to
                                require special mentioning:</p>
                            <p>The current administration of Austrian Federal Finance resulted in a
                                deficit only in the first year of reconstruction, i. e. in 1923,
                                while in the subsequent years fairly considerable surpluses were
                                obtained. Therefore, the total deficit shown in the years from 1924
                                onwards, represents such part of capital expenditure only as was not
                                covered by ordinary revenue, and, consequently, had to be defrayed
                                out of the yield of loans. Thus Austria succeeded, thanks to the
                                magnanimous support it received from all the nations participating
                                in the work of its reconstruction, to save its finances from utter
                                ruin and to establish the permanent equilibrium of the budget.
                                Moreover, a large portion of the purely productive capital
                                expenditures was covered by current revenue, so that the proceeds of
                                the reconstruction loan set apart for such capital expenditure, will
                                be sufficient up to the first months of 1928. Now, as is also shown
                                by the enclosed statement on the use of the said loan, the sums
                                disposable under this heading are almost exhausted. Only a sum of
                                approximately 26 million Schillings is left for capital expenditure
                                in 1928. The great works of reconstruction Austria undertook with
                                the help of funds drawn from the reconstruction loan, in the first
                                place the installation of electric traction on the Federal Railways,
                                and the laying of long distance telephone cables, both of them works
                                of highest importance to making Austria’s balance of payments
                                active, must be continued and completed, if the result aimed at,
                                namely to secure for Austria’s economy a permanent adequate position
                                in the ensemble of the various European economies, is to be
                                attained.</p>
                            <p>My Government therefore finds itself obliged to proceed to the issue
                                of an investments loan for which the basis is given through the said
                                decision taken by the Committee of Control in accordance with
                                Article 7 of Protocol II dated Geneva October 4th, 1923 [<hi

                                Austria for the relief credits granted to it. Likewise a further
                                postponement for this purpose is required of the payments to be made
                                in accordance with the stipulations of these bonds.</p>
                            <p>My Government has at the same time addressed to the Reparation
                                Commission the request to defer in favour of the intended loan and
                                for a period of 30 years i. e. up to 31. december, 1957, the charges
                                laid upon all the assets and revenues of Austria by virtue of
                                Article <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0536"/>197 of the Treaty
                                of St. Germain. It now ventures to ask also the Government of the
                                United States of America to grant the suspension of the lien, and
                                the postponement up to 31 december, 1957, of the payments due for
                                the relief credit granted to Austria to the amount of about 24
                                million Dollars plus interest.</p>
                            <p>In view of the nature of the proposed investments my Government deems
                                it indispensable that the loan to be contracted should be for 30
                                years at least, lest in the next few years that are devoted to
                                further reconstruction work, Austrian economy be charged with too
                                heavy obligations for the repayment of the loan.</p>
                            <p>In bringing the above request of my Government to your knowledge, I
                                should be greatly obliged if Your Excellency would kindly forward it
                                to the Government of the United States and advise me, at the

                            the improvement of highways, etc. It is intended that the loan be
                            offered in this country and in England and in the important Continental
                            markets to evidence international solidarity in behalf of Austrian
                            reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>We have been asked by the Austrian Government to issue the loan in this
                            country and we have indicated our willingness in principle to study the
                            matter, but it is still in its preliminary stages and nothing has been
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>The loan has already received the tentative approval of the Committee of
                            Guarantor States which guaranteed the Austrian loan of 1923. The
                            Trustees of that loan have been informed of the project and have
                            expressed their wish to be kept advised. We understand the proposal will
                            also be submitted to the Reparations Commission.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed that the new loan be secured by a second lien, subject
                            only to the loan of 1923, on Austrian customs and tobacco receipts and
                            on such other revenues as may be necessary, and that reparations and
                            relief claims be subordinated to it and postponed until after its
                            repayment, as in the case of the loan of 1923.</p>
                        <p>There will doubtless be presented to you by the Austrian Government in
                            due course, if indeed it has not already been done, a request that, as
                            in the case of the loan of 1923, Congress subordinate the relief lien of
                            the United States to the second charge now proposed to be granted and
                            postpone its relief claim for a period extending beyond the maturity of
                            the new loan, which would be say twenty-five or thirty years from the
                            date of issue. There will also arise the usual question whether for any
                            reason the Department of State interposes any objection to the proposed
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean by this letter to ask for a ruling from the Department of
                            State on a question which will thus be presented to it through official
                            channels. My purpose in telephoning you, and in writing you in this
                            detailed manner in accordance with your request, is only, as always, to
                            keep the Department promptly advised of foreign loans in
                            contemplation.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Committee of Guarantor States have
                                considered the request of the Austrian Government for their approval
                                under the Geneva Protocol II, of a new Austrian Loan for productive
                                capital works. They have had the advantage of receiving in addition
                                to the written memoranda furnished to them, verbal explanations from
                                the representatives of the Austrian Government. They have also had
                                the advantage of consultation with the Trustees of the Austrian
                                Guaranteed loan 1923.</p>
                            <p>The Committee have been informed that the Austrian Government do not
                                propose to raise any other foreign loan during the period of five
                                years covered by the present loan programme; and that it is the
                                intention of the Austrian Government to apply to the proposed loan,
                                some part of which will be raised in Austria itself, the principle
                                recommended in 1924 by the Financial Committee of the League of
                                Nations that revenue producing undertakings such as the post,
                                telegraphs and telephones, and the railways, will recoup to the
                                Austrian Treasury the charges for interest and amortization on such
                                part of the proceeds of the loan as may be allocated to them.</p>
                            <p>They understand that the Austrian Government will further make
                                available for productive investments during the five years 1928–1932
                                inclusive certain sums out of the current Budget revenue.</p>
                            <p>The Austrian Government will further make such written application to
                                the Trustees of the guaranteed loan 1923 as may be necessary under
                                the terms of the general bond of that loan: and they propose in due
                                course to apply to the Reparations Commission and the States holding
                                Austrian relief bonds for the necessary assents of those
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances the Committee of Guarantors acting on behalf
                                of the States whom they represent, raise no objection in principle
                                to the issue by the Austrian Government of a loan for an effective
                                sum not exceeding 725,000,000 shillings for the revenue producing
                                purposes of the Post Office and Railways indicated in the statement

                            <p>The Trustees have heard the interesting exposé made by the Austrian
                                delegation and taken note of the statements made by Doctor Schuller
                                concerning the projected loan; as regards this loan the Trustees
                                consider that they are not concerned to express an opinion unless
                                they consider that the projected loan is likely to be prejudicial to
                                the Austrian Government guaranteed loan 1923/43. Therefore, when the
                                terms and conditions of the loan are further advanced the Trustees
                                will be notified in time to enable them to consider whether these
                                are prejudicial to the interests of the bondholders of the Austrian
                                Government guaranteed loan 1923/43.</p>

                            of the letter of Assistant Secretary Castle (EA 863.51/839), dated
                            October 18, 1927. It is stated therein that the Austrian Government
                            wishes to know whether the Secretary of the Treasury has power, without
                            further authorization by Congress, to extend for an additional period of
                            five years the time of payment of the debt incurred by Austria for the
                            purchase of flour from the United States Grain Corporation.</p>
                        <p>If such authority is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury it must be
                            derived from the Joint Resolution of Congress of April 6, 1922, c. 124,
                            42 Stat. 491. By the terms of this Resolution the Secretary of the
                            Treasury was authorized “to extend, for a period not to exceed
                            twenty-five years, the time of payment of the principal and interest of
                            the debt incurred by Austria for the purchase of flour from the United
                            States Grain Corporation and to release Austrian assets pledged for the
                            payment of such loan, in whole or in part, as may in the judgement of
                            the Secretary of the Treasury be necessary for the accomplishment of
                            this Resolution: …”<note n="18" xml:id="d328fn18">Omission indicated in
                                the original letter.</note> By virtue of this authority the time of
                            payment of the debt was extended to June 1, 1943, and the lien given the
                            United States by Austrian Relief Bond No. 1, Series “B” of 1920, which
                            it holds, was subordinated to <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0540"

                        <p>In response to my request of the Attorney General for his opinion as to
                            whether under the Joint Resolution the Secretary of the Treasury might
                            in his discretion further subordinate to the proposed new Austrian
                            Federal Loan the lien given the United States by the terms of the
                            Austrian Relief Bond No. 1, Series “B” of 1920, he stated that “the
                            Secretary of the Treasury has no power to act further under this
                            Resolution . . . .”<note n="19" xml:id="d328fn19">Omission indicated in
                                the original letter.</note> A copy of the opinion of the Attorney
                            General, dated October 15, 1927, was transmitted to you by this
                            Department under date of October 18, 1927.<note n="20" xml:id="d328fn20"
                                >Not printed.</note> The basis given by the Attorney General for his
                            opinion is that “There is nothing in the Resolution to indicate that the
                            authority given the Secretary of the Treasury was to be a continuing one
                            or was to be exercised after the lapse of years and under changed
                            conditions.”</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the reasoning of the Attorney General in his opinion above
                            referred to necessarily leads to the conclusion that without further
                            authorization by Congress the Secretary of the Treasury has no authority
                            to further extend the time of payment of the debt incurred by Austria
                            for the purchase of flour from the United States Grain Corporation.</p>

                            opinion of law officers of this Government, the Secretary of the
                            Treasury has no power to act further under the Joint Resolution approved
                            April 6, 1922, and a new enabling act of Congress would be necessary to
                            enable him to take the suggested action.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            the Department’s telegram No. 20 of October 28th, 11 a.m., in response
                            to my telegram No. 54 of September 20th, 10 a.m. and despatch No. 1532
                            of the <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0541"/>20th ultimo, advising me
                            in substance that in the opinion of the Attorney General the Secretary
                            of the Treasury has no power to act further under the Joint Resolution
                            approved April 6th, 1922 and that a new enabling act of Congress will
                            therefore be necessary to enable him to take the action desired by the
                            Austrian Government. I am today advising Chancellor Seipel in the sense
                            of the foregoing. Especially in view of the formal request contained in
                            my despatch No. 1573 of the 17th instant, it is superfluous to emphasize
                            the desire of the Austrian Government for a new congressional enabling
                            act and I am taking it for granted that the Department will at the
                            proper time take appropriate action.</p>
                        <p>The decision set forth in the Department’s telegram under reference makes
                            it certain that the new loan will be on a 30-year basis, though Minister
                            of Finance Kienböck told me only yesterday that if the Secretary of the
                            Treasury were free to act under the Resolution of 1922 and cared to
                            exercise his discretion, a shorter term would be most seriously
                            considered. The Austrian Government had not definitely committed itself,
                            though the discussions in London and Paris had proceeded on the 30-year
                            theory. Dr. Kienböck intimated that he expects shortly favorable action
                            from the Reparation Commission and that the negotiations with the Relief
                            Credit Committee, acting for the Relief Credit states, of which the
                            Englishman, Leith Ross is chairman, vice Niemeyer, are proceeding
                            satisfactorily. I will of course keep the Department informed of
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I am enclosing herewith translations of two articles
                            from the “Wiener Boersen-Kurier” of the 17th and 24th instant dealing

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I have
                            recently had conference with the Chancellor and Dr. Schüller, and I am
                            enabled to state that the Austrian Government is on the verge of
                            abandoning that part of its request contained in the Chancellor’s letter
                            to me transmitted with my despatch No. 1573 of October 17th, 1927, which
                            has to do with the extension up to the 31st of December, 1957, of the
                            time of payment of the principal and interest of the debt incurred by
                            Austria for the purchase of flour from the United States Grain
                            Corporation, leaving only to be dealt with by congressional resolution
                            its request for the release of Austrian assets pledged for the payment
                            of said debt, so as to subordinate them to the new contemplated federal
                            loan. In stating this amended desire of the Austrian Government I have
                            followed rather the phraseology found in the Joint Resolution of
                            Congress approved April 6th, 1922, a copy of which was transmitted with
                            my despatch No. 1037 of May 10th, 1926.<note n="23" xml:id="d332fn23"
                                >Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Schüller is leaving today for London to attend the sessions of the Relief
                            Credit Committee which meets on the 2nd proximo, and he will there make
                            his amended announcement in harmony with the foregoing. The Austrian
                            Government now has to all intents and purposes a postponement of its
                            various relief credits until 1942 and upon further reflection it
                            apparently deems it more prudent not to complicate matters by asking for
                            a further postponement until 1957, as contemplated by the Chancellor’s
                            letter above mentioned. It does <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0543"
                            />desire that Austrian assets pledged to the relief credits be released
                            and subordinated in the manner indicated.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Schüller has been authorized formally to state to the Relief
                            Credit Committee in London that as soon as the new federal loan has been
                            floated the Austrian Government desires to take up the question of
                            entering into a general funding arrangement for the entire relief
                            credits which amount to about £25,000,000. All the outstanding relief
                            credit bonds provide that the terms of payment shall be the same in all
                            cases and Austria must therefore make the same arrangement with the
                            United States as is made with the other relief credit states. Schüller
                            says that it is to the advantage of Austria to take up the question of a
                            debt settlement at an early date and not wait until 1942. He has stated
                            this to me before, as I have elsewhere reported. It is obvious that he
                            hopes to eliminate or greatly curtail the payment of interest which is
                            now technically running. Austria anticipates, as I gather, that her
                            situation lays the foundation for the hope that she will receive at
                            least as favorable treatment from the United States as Italy did. It is
                            plain to me that the Austrian Government is especially anxious that the
                            relief credit debt settlement shall not be harnessed up in any way with
                            the new loan. If, as the Chancellor explained to me, the two matters
                            were considered together, the Austrian public would deem the conditions
                            too onerous. They would lump the interest and amortization charges of
                            the new loan and the relief credit settlement together. Schüller goes so
                            far as to say that the new loan would have to be abandoned. There have
                            been apparently some disquieting rumors, traceable to banking circles in
                            London and Vienna, to the effect that our Treasury Department or
                            Congress might stipulate a relief credit settlement before taking
                            favorable action upon the desired release of Austrian assets. Schüller
                            does not want to appear to be forced into making an arrangement which he
                            asserts his government desires to make voluntarily.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that Minister Prochnik has not been advised by
                            cable of these developments, though he has recently had some telegraphic
                            instructions about the disposition of alien property. I am therefore
                            taking the precaution of briefly informing the Department of the
                            existing situation by wire.</p>
                        <p>The government here seems to regard it as assured that J. P. Morgan &amp;
                            Company will undertake to float the new issue and that it will be the
                            only firm with which the Austrian Government will directly deal, though
                            a syndicate will doubtless be formed. I get the impression that the
                            advice of Morgan and Montagu Norman will be followed throughout.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The Federal Government of Austria
                            after having with the proceeds of a loan, the so-called League of
                            Nations Loan, successfully completed the reconstruction of its public
                            household and finances, by stabilizing the country’s currency, balancing
                            the budget and accomplishing other measures provided for in an
                            exhaustive restoration plan, is now anxious to likewise restore with the
                            aid of a second loan private economics and business to a state of
                            normalcy. In fact, my Government realize that the latter is an essential
                            requisite for assuring a lasting duration of the first success.</p>
                        <p>Before the first referred to loan could be issued it was necessary that
                            all countries holding a first lien on Austria’s assets for relief
                            credits defer this lien for a period of 20 years (the time fixed for the
                            repayment of the said loan).</p>
                        <p>Also the United States of America, as Your Excellency are aware of,
                            deferred with authorization of Congress (Lodge Resolution) their lien
                            for twenty years, beginning from 1923.</p>
                        <p>As long as the relief credits are still outstanding against Austria, a
                            similar action would be required to enable the issue of a second loan.
                            With other words the Federal Government of Austria face the necessity of
                            approaching the creditor nations again with a request for a further 10
                            year extension of the aforementioned period of deferment.</p>
                        <p>My Government, however, came to the conclusion that a settlement of the
                            relief credits would be preferable to a further extension of <pb n="459"
                                xml:id="pg_459" facs="0545"/>the lien and is proposing to all
                            creditor nations the following funding plan, which I am likewise
                            authorized to submit to Your Excellency.</p>
                        <p>This plan in its original construction provides for a refund of the
                            relief credits (capital and interest) within forty years (beginning
                            1928) on a rising scale (with lowest equal yearly instalments in the
                            first five years and highest equal yearly instalments in the last 25
                            Years).</p>
                        <p>But certain technical difficulties necessitated a change in this original
                            plan. An opinion rendered by experts considers payments on relief
                            credits prior to 1943 as contrary to the wording and spirit of the
                            agreement entered upon by the Austrian Government in connection with the
                            League of Nations Loan.</p>
                        <p>To overcome this technical obstacle, the Federal Government of Austria
                            propose, that a debt funding would be agreed upon along the
                            aforementioned line, that actual payments, however, would not be made
                            before 1943, and that from this time on the whole debt (capital and
                            interest) should be paid in 25 equal yearly instalments, and that these
                            instalments should also include an amount corresponding to the loss on
                            interest which the creditors suffered by non-payment of agreed upon
                            instalments due prior to 1943.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency would greatly oblige me by notifying me at your earliest
                            possible convenience whether in principle the Government of the United
                            States would accept to enter negotiations for a settlement of relief
                            credits along aforementioned lines.</p>
                        <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                        <p>It became apparent upon the occasion of the meeting of the Relief Credit
                            Committee in London on the 2nd instant, that Austrian official circles
                            had been unduly optimistic and had underestimated some of the obstacles
                            standing in their path. It there developed that the Dutch representative
                            stated flatly that his government desired that some plan for the
                            amortization of and payment of interest on the old relief credits be
                            made as a condition precedent to any action on its part. This was just
                            what Schüller wanted to avoid, as stated on page 3 of my despatch under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>As an offset to this request, the bankers (Montagu Norman and Morgan were
                            specifically mentioned) raised the contention that the Austrian
                            Government could not be required to arrange for any relief credit
                            settlement prior to 1943 when the long term reconstruction loan matures.
                            It was asserted that an earlier settlement would contravene the
                            announcement made in the bankers’ prospectus at the time the loan just
                            mentioned was floated in 1923, and that the prospectus was based upon
                            the bond contract. I have examined the American prospectus, a copy of
                            which I have in my files, and it does not seem to me to substantiate
                            this contention. The Foreign Office tells me that this was also the
                            opinion of the Austrian Government and Schüller so stated to the
                            bankers, whereupon they replied that if an earlier settlement was not
                            strictly against the letter of the reconstruction bond, it was against
                            its spirit. Inasmuch as the bankers’ views quite naturally carry very
                            great weight as intimated in the concluding paragraph of my
                            before-mentioned despatch No. 1629, the predicament which arose was
                            embarrassing. Furthermore, one of the less influential opposition
                            papers, “Der Montag”, printed a sensational story on the 5th instant,
                            which attracted some attention, to the effect that the loan had gone on
                            the rocks, mainly because of the opposition of Czechoslovakia. In point
                            of fact, Czechoslovakia is not interested in the relief credits, because
                            it extended none. The Czech Minister here denies that his government is
                            unfriendly. It is nevertheless true that the Austrians believe that the
                            Czechs have been throwing cold water on the loan proposal. Two reasons
                            are given: first, it is said that the electrification of the railways is
                            against Czech interests as it would make Austria less dependent upon
                            Czech coal and, secondly, some proceeds of the new loan were to be
                            devoted, it was announced, to the improvement of Austrian dairies, the
                            Austrian market for milk from Southern Moravia thereby being
                            lessened.</p>
                        <p>Italy’s attitude also created some uneasiness. (See in this connection my
                            despatch No. 1655 of the 12th instant).<note n="30" xml:id="d337fn30"
                                >Not printed.</note> The Italian relief credit delegate suddenly
                            left London for Rome for further instructions after the meeting on the
                            2nd.</p>
                        <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>Dr. Schüller advised his government from London of the situation and the
                            Relief Credit Committee took an adjournment until Monday, the 12th. The
                            result of all this was that after a Cabinet council Schüller was
                            instructed by telegram on Thursday, the 8th, to make a relief credit
                            settlement proposal. The entire relief credits expressed in Austrian
                            currency amount to 848,000,000 schillings. (This is approximately the
                            equivalent of the £25,000,000 mentioned on page 2 of my despatch No.
                            1629.) The accrued interest on this amount from now in 1927 up to 1943,
                            the before-mentioned date of maturity of the reconstruction loan, is
                            figured at 152,000,000 schillings, making the total amount due in 1943
                            approximately 1,000 million schillings. Schüller was authorized to
                            propose that beginning in 1943 the Austrian Government would undertake
                            to pay the amount just mentioned in twenty-five annual instalments of
                            40,000,000 schillings each. The Austrian Government desires to reserve
                            the right to pay, beginning in 1929 and up to 1943, something on
                            account. It is provisionally proposed, if this right be utilized, to pay
                            at first 10,000,000 schillings annually and subsequently 15,000,000 if
                            the federal finances justify it. In the event payments are thus
                            anticipated, interest at the rate of 8 per cent is to be deducted from
                            the before-mentioned 1,000 million schillings due as of 1943. It is
                            figured out that the estimated interest of 152,000,000 schillings would
                            be greatly reduced and of course the annual instalment beginning from
                            1943 would be substantially cut down. As I have heretofore reported, the
                            Austrian Government hopes ultimately to avoid paying interest on its
                            relief credits, taking into account their intrinsic character. I think
                            there is some question however whether any advance payments will ever be
                            made. It is hoped nevertheless, by a proposal of this kind, to meet the
                            bankers’ views. The Chancellor said to me significantly on Monday that
                            the position of the bankers was helpful to his government.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the Schüller telegram had been sent was communicated to me
                            on the evening of the 8th by the Finance Minister, Kien-böck. I promised
                            however that I would not cable any statement of the situation, which was
                            given me in the strictest confidence, and indeed there was no reason for
                            doing so as it was anticipated that something definite would transpire
                            at the adjourned Relief Credit Committee meeting on Monday, the 12th.
                            This anticipation was realized. The Committee took cognizance of the
                            relief credit settlement proposal as made by Schüller, and stated that
                            it would be transmitted to the various governments represented on the
                            Committee for action. I expect to be able later to transmit the exact
                            formula of this proposal; something, as I understand, that was left to
                            Schüller’s discretion. The Committee further passed a resolution
                            authorizing <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0549"/>the subordination
                            to the projected new federal loan for a period of thirty years of the
                            Austrian assets or securities pledged for the repayment of the relief
                            credits. This last action was taken by the Committee although the Dutch
                            and Swiss delegates were without authority to vote affirmatively for the
                            resolution. The Committee apparently had reason to believe that the
                            written assent of the Dutch and Swiss governments would be presently
                            forthcoming. … Apparently the fear expressed to me by Dr. Kienböck that
                            parliamentary assent of other countries than the United States might be
                            found to be necessary, proved to be groundless.</p>
                        <p>The next step will be the proceedings before the Reparation Commission.
                            There has been some reason to apprehend that Rumania would seek to make
                            action here contingent upon the settlement of some controversy which it
                            has with Austria, but I am told that pressure has been brought to bear
                            to keep the former country quiet.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to this Department’s letter
                            of December 8 and to previous correspondence regarding the Austrian
                            relief indebtedness to the United States and the proposed flotation of a
                            new Austrian loan, I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a
                            note of December 6, 1927, addressed to the Department by the Austrian
                            Minister at Washington. I also transmit a copy of despatch No. 1629,
                            dated November 30, 1927, from the American Minister at Vienna on the
                            same subject.</p>
                        <p>The note of the Austrian Minister makes the specific proposal that an
                            agreement be made at this time for the funding of the relief debt; that
                            actual payments should not begin until 1943; and that from 1943 “the
                            whole debt (capital and interest) should be paid in 25 equal yearly
                            instalments, and that these instalments should also include an amount
                            corresponding to the loss on interest which the creditors suffered by
                            non-payment of agreed upon instalments due prior to 1943”. The Austrian
                            Minister stated in conversation on December 5 that the proposed funding
                            of the relief debts was on the supposition that the relief debt
                            creditors will raise no objection to the new loan, and will give it
                            precedence until it is paid off in 1958. The note, however, does not
                            raise this question but inquires only “whether in principle the
                            Government of the United States would accept to enter negotiations for a
                            settlement of relief debt credits along aforementioned lines”.</p>
                        <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>Despatch No. 1629 of November 30 indicates that at that time the Austrian
                            Government desired that the funding of the relief credit bonds and the
                            subordination of the lien of these bonds to the new Federal loan be not
                            considered together. It was apparently the intention of the Austrian
                            Government to propose to the International Relief Bonds Committee
                            meeting at London that the relief creditors subordinate the lien of
                            their bonds and that as soon as the new loan has been floated the
                            question of entering into a general funding arrangement for the relief
                            credits be taken up.</p>
                        <p>On December 14 the Department was informed by Mr. Leffingwell of J. P.
                            Morgan and Company that discussions were going on in London between the
                            Austrian Government and the European Relief Creditor States. It will be
                            remembered from Reparation Commission Annex 3258 B–1, a copy of which
                            was transmitted to you by a letter of October 21, 1927,<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d338fn31">Not printed.</note> that an International Relief
                            Bonds Committee, representing the Governments of Denmark, France, Great
                            Britain, Holland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland met in Treasury
                            Chambers, London, and, on or about July 14, 1927, agreed with the
                            Austrian Government to replace the bonds of Relief Series B of 1920 with
                            renewal bonds maturing January 1, 1943, and bearing 5% interest. You
                            will recall that a secretary of the American Embassy at London attended
                            meetings of this Committee during the last half of 1924. The Department,
                            however, has since that time not been in direct touch with the
                            proceedings of the Committee. It may be noted, in passing, that the
                            settlements which this Committee has negotiated with relief debtors have
                            been much more favorable to the creditor governments than the
                            settlements which the United States has negotiated with its debtors.</p>
                        <p>The Department has orally assured the Austrian Minister that his formal
                            proposal for the funding of the relief debts would be given prompt
                            consideration by this Department and by the Treasury Department. In this
                            connection, you will note the statement of the Austrian Minister that
                            his Government has made the same proposal to the governments of the
                            eight other relief creditor States.</p>
                        <p>Since substantial unanimity of action on the part of these governments
                            will be required if the proposed funding is to be carried out, there is
                            no occasion, pending further developments, to consider making at this
                            time any affirmative commitment regarding the eventual attitude of this
                            Government. This Department, however, feels that, if you concur, the
                            Austrian Minister might now be informed that this Government is in
                            principle disposed to consider at this time an arrangement for payment
                            of the relief obligation commencing in 1943, but that it desires a more
                            specific statement of the proposal <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465"
                                facs="0551"/>before a further expression of views can be given him.

                            discussions, I may say this Department has received no suggestion from
                            the Austrian Government or from any of the Creditor States that it
                            should participate in or keep in touch with these discussions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With further reference to my despatch No.
                            1656 of the 14th instant, in relation to the projected new federal loan,
                            I have the honor to report that following Dr. Schüller’s return to
                            Vienna at the end of last week I had a brief conference with him on
                            Saturday last <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0552"/>and a more
                            extended one today. As a result, I find that the facts reported in my
                            despatch under reference were, in the main, correct. They were supplied
                            to me by a Minister Plenipotentiary attached to the Foreign Office who
                            was acting in Schüller’s absence.</p>
                        <p>The latter tells me that at the first meeting of the International Relief
                            Bonds Committee on the 2nd instant, he announced the willingness of his
                            government to proceed promptly to some funding arrangement for the old
                            relief credits, but again emphasized Austria’s great desire, as I have
                            heretofore reported, to disassociate this funding arrangement from the
                            new loan negotiations. The various members of the Committee, according
                            to Schüller, expressed their sympathetic understanding with this
                            attitude, but added in substance: “You state that you are willing to
                            make some funding proposal. Can’t you give us some hint of what this
                            proposal is to be before we take action on your request to subordinate
                            to the new loan the securities pledged to the old relief credits?”
                            Furthermore, the position of the Dutch representative, set forth on page
                            2 of my despatch under reference, was not lost on Schüller. He thereupon
                            outlined his idea of a funding proposal, a synopsis of which he cabled
                            Minister Prochnik. He assumes that Prochnik promptly got in touch with
                            the Department. The International Relief Bonds Committee took the
                            adjournment until December 12th, as I have already reported, and
                            Schüller advised his government of what he had done. The result was his
                            telegram of instructions of December 8th, to which allusion was made on
                            page 3 of my despatch No. 1656. These instructions practically embodied
                            Schüller’s recommendations. He thereupon made his formal proposal on
                            December 12th, and on December 13th he transmitted it in writing to
                            Prochnik. This time he did not telegraph the latter and presumably the
                            Minister’s advices reached Washington almost coincidently with my
                            before-mentioned despatch No. 1656 of December 14th.</p>

                            probably be asked for by the governments interested. In fact, I have
                            been permitted to glance through an informal <hi rend="italic">aide

                                    connection, I may say that Schüller informs me that he arrived
                                    at the sum of 1,000 million schillings by adding to the 848

                                    at the rate of 6 per cent, and Schüller admits that on this
                                    basis the total amount due would more closely approximate the
                                    1,250 million schillings. He asserts however that the idea of
                                    paying any interest upon credits of this character arising out
                                    of supplies furnished in time of dire need to feed a starving
                                    population is repugnant and that it was never really
                                    contemplated that interest would be exacted. He ventures the
                                    opinion that Secretary Hoover, having charge of the relief
                                    credit operations, never seriously believed in the repayment of

                                <item>The payment of 10 million schillings annually for five years,
                                    beginning in 1929, appears to be satisfactory, but for the
                                    second period of five years an increase of payments from 15
                                    million to 20 million was suggested. There was some further
                                    suggestion that beginning in 1943 the period of annual
                                    instalments should, if necessary, be somewhat extended so as to
                                    provide for the payment of 1,250 million schillings instead of
                                    1,000 million.</item>

                            Committee are regarded as only affording a basis for negotiation. The
                            Austrian Government does not believe that it will be required in the end
                            to pay 1,250 million schillings. Schüller, as I have heretofore
                            reported, feels that his government should get in principle from the
                            United States as favorable treatment as the United States accorded
                            Italy. This, he realizes, is hardly possible because the relief credit
                            settlements must all be on the same basis. The Austrian actuaries have
                            figured out that Italy will pay back in the end about 26 per cent of
                            what she would have been required to pay on any normal interest funding
                            arrangement, whereas the proposal of the Austrian Government as made in
                            the before-mentioned <hi rend="italic">aide memoire</hi> means, so the
                            actuaries figure, that Austria obligates herself to pay 37 or 38 per
                            cent of the amount for which it would be liable taking into account the
                            6 per cent rate of interest. On the basis of the Austrian proposal the
                            United States would stand to recover about $28,000,000 on account of the
                            approximately $24,000,000 Grain Corporation loan, whereas on the basis
                            of the informal counter proposal of the International Relief Bonds
                            Committee the United States would in the end recover, as I understand,
                            from $32,000,000 to $34,000,000. Having the Italian precedent in mind
                            and taking into account the intrinsic character of the original loan,
                            the Austrian Government hopes that the United States will <pb n="469"

                            will not enhance the difficulties of settlement.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a copy of the resolution of release of securities passed

                            It requires a little elucidation. The “consent in principle” refers to
                            the conditions (1), (2) and (3) therein incorporated. As to the clause
                            relating to legislative approval, Schüller assures me that in the
                            protocol of the proceedings, in response to his enquiry for information,
                            it transpired, upon roll call, that legislation to subordinate
                            securities to the new loan was not required, but only legislative
                            approval of a proposal to postpone beyond 1943 the payment of the
                            principal and interest on relief credits. Legislative sanction therefore
                            does not here come into question, the Austrian Government having
                            abandoned its original request for postponement until 1957.</p>
                        <p>As to the final paragraph relating to the views of the Netherlands and
                            Swiss governments, the concurrence of these governments has since been
                            obtained, as is evidenced by a communication of the International Relief

                                    Austrian Investment Loan of 725 Million Schillings</hi></head>
                            <p>The Committee has taken due note of the proposals of the Austrian
                                Government and of the declarations of the Austrian representatives;
                                it has been informed that the Austrian Government will during the
                                    <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0558"/>coming five years not
                                contract any other foreign loan and that it intends in the case of
                                the proposed loan, of which a part will be floated in Austria
                                itself, to continue to comply with the recommendations of the
                                Control Committee of the League of Nations of the year 1924
                                concerning the interest on the investment sum to be obtained through
                                the post and railway administration. The Committee takes due note
                                that the Austrian Government intends to use certain sums from
                                current receipts for productive investments, for instance for roads
                                and other investments. The Austrian Government will, should need
                                arise, address itself to the trustees in accordance with the general
                                bond, and contemplates approaching the Reparation Commission and the
                                Relief Powers. The Control Committee does not protest in principle
                                against the contraction of a loan with proceeds not exceeding 725
                                million schillings for profit-yielding purposes of post and
                                railways, according to the Austrian proposals. The Committee has
                                authorized its president, after the concrete loan terms have been
                                communicated to him to give the definitive consent.</p>

                            Government on the progress of negotiations conducted in London with a
                            view of deferring the liens held against Austria by various nations for
                            relief credits in order to pave the way for a new Government loan,
                            necessitates some modification of the proposal submitted to Your
                            Excellency with my note ddo. December 6th, 1927, No. 2423/70.</p>
                        <p>In said note (par. 5) I stated that my Government came to the conclusion
                            that a settlement of the relief credits would be preferable to a further
                            extension of the lien.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, however, the other creditor nations have with the
                            consent of the relief committee deferred their liens for relief credits
                            for a period of 30 years beginning from the date of issue of the
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>This deferment of lien does in no way alter the resolution of the
                            Austrian Federal Government to settle the relief credits in conformity
                            with a plan outlined in my previous note. The pertaining negotiations
                            are progressing favorably although final settlement may experience some
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>In view of the aforementioned facts I have the honor to solicit Your
                            Excellency’s kind intermediary in causing an appropriate legislation to
                            be recommended to Congress authorizing the Government <pb n="473"
                                xml:id="pg_473" facs="0559"/>of the United States in terms similar
                            to those adopted in the so-called Lodge-Resolution to likewise defer for
                            a period of 30 years beginning from the date of issue of the loan the
                            lien for relief credits extended to Austria.</p>
                        <p>On the same occasion I would appreciate an early notification as to
                            whether or not the Government of the United States is willing to enter
                            into negotiations for a settlement of Austria’s relief debts along the
                            lines indicated in my previous note.</p>
                        <p>In connection therewith I am in a position to state that my Government,
                            although not being able—for reasons mentioned before—to enter into an
                            agreement stipulating for payments to be made prior to 1943, could and
                            will reserve a right to commence payments on January 1st, 1929.</p>
                        <p>In fact my Government is contemplating to start the first payments on the
                            relief debts on the last mentioned date.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I received your letter of
                            December 23rd and we have cabled to our London partners to inform Baron
                            Franckenstein, whose intention it was long since to ask the Department
                            whether it wished to be represented in the discussions.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that the Department will receive first hand information
                            from the Austrian Government in due course, but, in view of Assistant
                            Secretary Castle’s letter of October 22nd,<note n="41" xml:id="d342fn41"
                                >Not printed.</note> I am writing to post you briefly concerning
                            developments since my letter of October 18th to Secretary Kellogg was
                            written.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned to you when you were in town, the European Relief Creditor
                            States, though willing to subordinate their lien to that of the proposed
                            new loan, are unwilling to postpone their claim until after the maturity
                            thereof. The Austrian Government, on the other hand, is anxious to stop
                            accumulation of interest on the relief claims, for the European Relief
                            Creditors are taking bonds from the Austrian Government for such
                            interest. As I understand it, the Relief Creditors’ Committee now have
                            before them a proposal of the Austrian Government to pay for 25 years
                            from 1943 onwards 40,000,000 schillings <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"
                                facs="0560"/>per annum, i. e., a total of 1,000,000,000 schillings;
                            the Austrian Government reserving the right, however, at its option, to
                            anticipate these payments in part by paying for five years from 1929
                            10,000,000 schillings per annum, during the next ten years 15,000,000
                            per annum, the sums so paid, with 8% compound interest until 1943, to be
                            deducted from the total of 1,000,000,000 schillings. If prepayments as
                            outlined above to the aggregate of 200,000,000 schillings were made
                            prior to 1943, the Government would then have to pay only 26,250,000 a
                            year for 25 years from 1943.</p>

                            of December 23, 1927, regarding the Austrian relief indebtedness to the
                            United States and the proposed flotation of a new Austrian loan, I have
                            the honor to transmit for your consideration a copy of note No. 2531/70,
                            dated December 28, 1927, from the Austrian Minister at Washington.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the Austrian Minister requests that there be
                            recommended to Congress appropriate legislation authorizing the
                            postponement of the relief credit lien for a period of thirty years from
                            the date of issue of the contemplated new Austrian loan. The Minister
                            also requests an early reply to his previous inquiry whether the
                            Government of the United States is willing to enter into negotiations
                            for a settlement of Austria’s relief debt along the lines indicated in
                            his note No. 2423/70 of December 6, 1927.</p>
                        <p>I also transmit herewith a copy of a letter, dated December 29, 1927,
                            from Mr. R. C. Leffingwell of J. P. Morgan and Company, regarding
                            discussions in progress between the Austrian Government and the European
                            Relief Creditor States. This letter gives further information as to the
                            nature of the arrangement which the Austrian Government appears to
                            contemplate. The first paragraph of Mr. Leffingwell’s letter indicates

                            sense indicated in the Department’s letter of December 23, pointing out
                            that the consideration by this Government of the <pb n="475"

                            facilitated by the receipt of more specific information as to the
                            proposal for funding the relief debt, since this Government would like
                            to consider both subjects at the same time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I deem it proper to acquaint the
                            Department with the fact that early in the current week I took occasion,
                            in alluding to the deplorable incidents arising out of the recent
                            rioting in the City of Vienna, to express to the Chancellor the sympathy
                            of the Government of the United States and to congratulate the Austrian
                            Government upon its success in speedily restoring order. Similar
                            statements, I have the honor to report, were made by most of my
                            colleagues in the name of their respective governments and I assumed
                            that such action on my part would meet with the approval of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In common with other Legations, I have also the honor to state, I
                            received a formal notice from the President of Police of the interment
                            on Thursday of the police officers killed in line of duty during the
                            insurrectionary outbreak. Specific inquiries came from several of my
                            colleagues, notably from the English and Italian Legations, as to
                            whether I intended to be present at the obsequies. This decision was not
                            so easy to make. I felt that the Government of the United States has
                            special reason to be grateful to the Police Direction for so assiduously
                            guarding American officials here in Vienna on account of the
                            Sacco-Vanzetti incident—I have voiced my personal gratitude on several
                            occasions. Nevertheless, the notice or invitation did not emanate from
                            the Federal Government and it seemed to me that the presence of foreign
                            diplomats might be construed as undue meddling in an internal matter.
                            This, I ascertained upon talking with him, was also the view of the
                            Belgian Minister, Le Ghait, the Dean of the Corps. The Italian Minister
                            was especially anxious to know my final decision—perhaps because it is
                            generally <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0562"/>recognized, I think,
                            that my relations with Police President Schober are extremely cordial. I
                            may possibly be exceptional—I do not know—in having been able to see him
                            at all times during the recent trouble. In any event, I got the
                            impression that had the American Legation been represented, the Italian
                            Legation would have been also. If the representatives of Republican
                            America and Fascist Italy had been conspicuous by their attendance, I
                            can imagine the comment of the radical press. My decision was mainly
                            influenced however by the circumstance that the Federal Government
                            itself neither expressly nor impliedly intimated its desire in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is submitted for the Department’s information and possible
                            comment.</p>

                            treaties of friendship, commerce and consular rights, of which the
                            central principle in respect of commerce is an unconditional

                            objection, to inquire whether it would be agreeable to the Government of
                            Bolivia to proceed to the negotiation with the United States of a
                            similar treaty. A special draft of treaty will, of course, be prepared
                            for presentation to Bolivia if this proposal is acceptable to the
                            Bolivian Government. That certain departures from the text of the German
                            treaty should be made is probable, but the views of both countries in
                            respect of this matter may appropriately be exchanged during the course
                            of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It would be gratifying if, among its early treaties embodying this
                            principle, the United States could celebrate a general commercial treaty
                            with Bolivia. Such treaty would supersede the Treaty of Peace,
                            Friendship, Commerce and Navigation which was concluded by the two

                            1858 would not now be acceptable to this Government.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, though the Department, in proposing a
                            treaty with Bolivia, is influenced chiefly by its policy of concluding
                            with other countries generally treaties containing the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause, you are nevertheless desired to use especial
                            diligence in seeking a favorable response from the Bolivian Government,
                            thus forestalling any efforts that other countries may be planning to
                            make for the purpose of interposing in South American arrangements based
                            upon special privilege—a policy wholly antagonistic to the policy of
                            equality of treatment which the United States is undertaking to promote.
                            You may recall in this connection that in 1923 this Government renounced
                            the preferential customs treatment which certain American products had
                            been receiving in Brazil and requested instead a pledge of equal footing
                            with other countries in the Brazilian market.<note n="6"

                        <p>For your further confidential information and guidance, it was some time
                            ago suggested to the Department that there was a movement on the part of
                            Spain to seek from the countries of Latin America special commercial
                            concessions in return for certain advantages to be accorded to their
                            commerce in Spain. In this connection see the Department’s circular

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            Instruction No. 308, of August 19, 1927, in regard to the United States
                            celebrating a general commercial treaty with Bolivia that would
                            supersede “The Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Commerce and Navigation”,
                            which was concluded by the two countries on May 13, 1858, I have the
                            honor to report, upon discreet inquiry, that Bolivia would not at this
                            time have any objection to such a treaty, so far as is known by the
                            President and his Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Just at this time, however, the Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship
                            is regarded as hardly in position to take up such a matter immediately.
                            Dr. Alberto Gutierrez, the Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship,
                            and to whom the President has delegated consideration and action upon
                            international affairs, is critically ill and has not been in the
                            Ministry for more than two months.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tomas Manuel Elio, the Minister of Hacienda and Industry, is
                            temporarily in charge of the Portfolio of Foreign Relations. Dr. Alberto
                            Cortadellas is Sub-Secretary and is in reality despatching all the work
                            of this Ministry.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that if Dr. Gutiérrez does not recover soon, that a new
                            Minister will be appointed and then the Bolivian Government will be
                            pleased to consider the foregoing matter. Among those spoken of as the
                            successor of Dr. Gutiérrez, in case he does not become physically able
                            to assume his duties, is Dr. Daniel Sanchez Bustamente, the Bolivian
                            Minister to Chile, and at present in Buenos Aires as President of the
                            Mission that is seeking to arbitrate the boundary question between
                            Bolivia and Paraguay as to the Chaco.<note n="9" xml:id="d347fn9">See

                        <p>238. As the British Government has appointed a Minister for the Irish
                            Free State and has expressed its intention of appointing a Minister for
                            Canada, the Government of the United States desires to appoint a
                            Minister to each of these countries. You are instructed to confer with
                            Mr. Chamberlain and determine if such appointments would be acceptable
                            to the British Government. Also endeavor to ascertain the desires of the
                            British Government as to whom the Minister will be accredited and to
                            whom his credentials should be presented. The following is for your
                            information. The President has power to make the appointment without
                            legislation but we must have an appropriation from Congress. Since this
                            is the short session we desire to secure the appropriation as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>I have been instructed to inform you that His Majesty’s Government in
                            Canada has not been under any misapprehension as to the extent to which
                            the abstraction of water through the Chicago Sanitary Canal has lowered
                            the levels of the Great Lakes and that it has been fully advised that
                            this lowering has been in the neighbourhood of six inches. The papers

                            the protests of the Government of Canada against the abstraction,
                            submitted on behalf of the people of Canada generally, as well as the
                            protest of the Government of Ontario, submitted on behalf of the people

                            water through the Sanitary Canal, does not in any degree whatsoever
                            affect the viewpoint of His Majesty’s Government in Canada as expressed
                            in this correspondence.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government in Canada desires to take this opportunity of
                            pointing out that if any misapprehension exists in the United States or
                            in Canada as to the degree of lowering occasioned by the Chicago
                            abstraction, the publication of these papers will go a long way towards
                            removing such misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in Canada
                            enter upon a further discussion of the practical question of providing
                            compensatory works as recommended by the Joint Board of Engineers, it
                            may be pointed out that the installation of compensatory works for the
                            restoration of lake levels will in no way recoup to the Great Lakes
                            System the power which is lost to that system by the water abstracted
                            therefrom through the Sanitary Canal. While recognizing the marked
                            advantages which may be gained by the construction of suitable
                            compensating works, His Majesty’s Government in Canada would not be
                            prepared to enter upon a discussion of any plans for the construction of
                            such works, if this course involved an assumption that the present
                            abstraction is to continue.</p>
                        <p>With reference, however, to the question immediately under consideration,
                            His Majesty’s Government in Canada observes nothing in the Report of the
                            Joint Engineering Board, including Appendices, which would render
                            inadvisable the publication of the papers in question. On the contrary
                            it is considered that the release of these papers would have a marked
                            effect in clarifying public opinion on the question in both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I have the honour therefore to enquire whether the Government of the
                            United States would not be prepared to publish the correspondence listed
                            in Mr. Chilton’s note of November 16th, 1926,<note n="11"

                            inform you that this Government raises no objection to the publication
                            of the correspondence referred to therein, relating to the diversion of

                        <p>This Government has not failed to recognize the importance of the
                            contentions made by the Canadian Government relating to the abstraction
                            of water from one watershed and the diversion of it into another. In my
                            note of July 26, 1926, I informed the British Ambassador that this
                            Government was not prepared to admit the conclusions of law stated in
                            his notes of February 5, 1926, and May 1, 1926, on this question.<note

                            did not think it was advisable to enter into a discussion of this legal
                            question in view of the fact that the issues involved in certain cases
                            which were then and are still pending in the Supreme Court of the United
                            States are closely parallel to the questions presented in the
                            Ambassador’s notes. For this same reason I do not now desire to enter
                            into a discussion of this question at the present moment.</p>
                        <p>This Government, however, has heretofore indicated that it is prepared to
                            enter into discussions and negotiations with Canada covering the whole
                            question of preservation of lake levels in the mutual interest of the
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>This Government is glad to note the agreement by the Government of Canada
                            with the conclusions of the Joint Board of Engineers that the diversion
                            at Chicago has affected lake levels less than six inches. It also notes
                            the feeling on the part of the Canadian Government that lake levels
                            could be dealt with, so far as navigation is concerned, by compensating
                            works as recommended by the Joint Board of Engineers. It would appear in
                            this connection that the question as to the practical results of
                            diversion in its effect on navigation could be entirely remedied.</p>
                        <p>As to the observation by the Canadian Government that the installation of
                            compensatory works to restore lake levels would not recoup to the Great
                            Lakes System the power lost to the system by the diversion at Chicago, I
                            would, without in any way admitting the principles of compensation, call
                            attention to the fact that Canada <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487"
                                facs="0573"/>now receives 36,000 second feet at Niagara as against
                            20,000 cubic feet per second on the American side for power purposes. I
                            would further observe that without development of the lower St. Lawrence
                            this question does not arise in that connection.</p>
                        <p>I again wish to point out that all these problems appeal to the American
                            Government as matters that may be settled by practical engineering
                            measures which might be adopted pending further discussion of the
                            principles involved.</p>

                            Lakes and the St. Lawrence River have furnished a common highway and
                            transportation outlet for the population in the interior of the
                            continent in both the United States and Canada. The waterway has been
                            the subject of several treaties and conventions between the two
                            countries. Its development has been a matter of continuous effort on the
                            part of both countries.</p>

                            governments under authority of the treaty of January 11, 1909,<note

                            feasibility of improving navigational facilities of the St. Lawrence

                            into an ocean shipway. The Commission submitted its report, signed on

                            the United States after taking into consideration the existing
                            characteristics of the waterway and its projected development, as well
                            as the essential economic factors. It earnestly recommended to both
                            governments the making of a treaty for a scheme of shipway improvement
                            of the river between Montreal and Lake Ontario. It suggested, however,
                            that before final decision be made, the engineering features should
                            receive further consideration and study. Delays naturally ensued due to
                            the problems of reconstruction resulting from the war.</p>

                            Commerce, to consider the whole project in its economic and national
                            aspects and to express an opinion as to whether the project should be
                            undertaken and the Government of Canada on May 7, 1924, appointed a
                            national advisory committee under the chairmanship of the Honorable
                            George Perry Graham, Minister of Railways and Canals. Through the
                            arrangements brought about by these committees the two governments by

                                    Engineers on St. Lawrence Waterway Project</hi>, p. 4.</note>
                            gave instructions to a Joint Board of Engineers designated by them to
                            review and extend the engineering plans as recommended by the
                            International Joint Commission in 1921.</p>
                        <p>This Joint Engineering Board made an elaborate resurvey of the lake and
                            river systems both as to navigation and power, and filed with each
                            government an exhaustive report upon all its engineering aspects. The
                            representatives of the two countries differed as to a few details but
                            from the report it clearly appears that the improvement of the waterway
                            for navigation and power purposes is both feasible and advisable.</p>
                        <p>The St. Lawrence River Commission appointed by the President to advise
                            this Government on the subject recently undertook an examination of all
                            of the economic as well as engineering facts bearing upon the proposed
                            development and has made a complete report covering all aspects. It
                            concluded that the construction of the ship-way at proper depths would
                            relieve the interior of the continent, especially agriculture, from the
                            economic handicaps of adverse transportation costs which now operate to
                            the disadvantage of many states and a large part of Canada, would serve
                            the industrial well being of both countries in the development of their
                            power resources, and would tend largely to the increase of prosperity
                            and the stimulation of industry. The Commission recommended that
                            negotiations should be entered into with your Government in an endeavor
                            to arrive at an agreement as to the speedy development of this
                            waterway.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States adopts the recommendations of the St.
                            Lawrence Commission. It appreciates the advantages which will accrue
                            equally to both countries by the opening of the waterway to ocean
                            shipping. It feels that the necessary increase in railway rates due to
                            the war, and the modern practices respecting the generation and
                            transmission of hydroelectric power have increased the importance and
                            practicability of early development, and believes that the factors which
                            influence its conclusions must have equal application to, and influence
                            upon, the Dominion of Canada.</p>
                        <p>In view of the action already taken by both governments, it is
                            apprehended that they are in accord on the principle that the project
                                <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0575"/>should be undertaken. If
                            this Government’s conclusion in this respect be correct, there only
                            remains to be effected an understanding as to the methods and means for
                            its earliest accomplishment. It seems highly appropriate that the
                            development of the common highway for the benefit of both countries
                            should be jointly undertaken.</p>
                        <p>This Government is prepared to enter into negotiations with a view to the
                            formulation of a convention appropriate to this subject and should be
                            grateful to be informed of the views entertained on this subject by your
                            Government.</p>

                                and considered carefully the note of the Secretary of State of the
                                United States to the Canadian Minister at Washington of April 13th,
                                1927, on the St. Lawrence Waterway.</p>
                            <p>It shares the appreciation felt by the Government of the United
                                States of the importance of the problem of the development of the
                                St. Lawrence and of the aid in the solution of the engineering
                                aspects of this problem afforded by the reports of the International
                                Joint Commission and of the Joint Board of Engineers appointed by
                                the two Governments in 1925.</p>
                            <p>The report of the Joint Board of Engineers signed on November 16th,
                                1926, while unanimous in many respects, indicated differences <pb

                                phases of the development proposed. It is understood that in the

                                alternative schemes will be presented which will be of essential

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to invite your attention
                            to the conditions which cause the periodic overflow of the Roseau River
                            in the State of Minnesota and the Province of Manitoba.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Roseau River has tributaries in both the United States
                            and Canada. The main stream, after flowing through the northwestern part
                            of the State of Minnesota, passes into Manitoba and flows through the
                            southern part of that province before emptying into the Red River. In
                            the natural state of the stream the fall is slight and the channel is
                            inadequate to carry the water originating above Roseau Lake. The
                            construction of drainage ditches in Minnesota and Manitoba has increased
                            the volume of water discharged into the main stream of the Roseau River
                            and has subjected the riparian property to inundation at times of
                            increased rainfall. I am informed that the State of Minnesota has
                            deepened and improved the channel of the Roseau River at various times
                            in the past twenty years and has thus increased the capacity of the
                            channel to the maximum which can be reached until the fall in certain
                            Canadian reaches of the river is increased. Even with the improvements
                            that have been made, land in the United States for a considerable
                            distance from the river is subject to periodic flooding by the waters of
                            the Roseau River.</p>
                        <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0577"/>
                        <p>I understand that surveys are now being made in Manitoba with a view to
                            the ditching of additional drainage into the Canadian tributaries of the
                            Roseau. It is also my understanding that other surveys are being
                            conducted in Canada with a view to the construction of dikes along the
                            banks of the river. Both of these proposed improvements, if carried out,
                            would further aggravate the situation as to flooding in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In the view of this Government the question of the improvement of the
                            Roseau River in such a manner as to protect riparian owners is of
                            sufficient importance to justify the United States and Canada in
                            referring it to the International Joint Commission for investigation and
                            report under the provisions of Article IX of the Boundary Waters Treaty
                            of 1909.<note n="21" xml:id="d356fn21"><ref target="frus1910#pg_532"><hi

                            the Canadian Government would be disposed to join this Government in
                            referring the entire problem of improvement of the Roseau River drainage
                            system in the interests alike of the people of Minnesota and Manitoba to

                            would be willing to join the United States in such a reference to the
                            Commission, it might be desirable for the two Governments to designate

                            terms of reference.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your note of April 2nd.
                            1927 and previous correspondence concerning the improvement of the
                            drainage of the valley of the Roseau River, I have the honour to inform
                            you that no decision has yet been arrived at by His Majesty’s Government
                            in Canada with regard to the proposed reference to the International
                            Joint Commission of the entire problem of this improvement, inasmuch as
                            the question is still under discussion with the authorities of the
                            Province of Manitoba.</p>
                        <p>2. The operations for the improvement of the river, which are now being
                            carried on in conjunction by the Federal and Provincial Governments,
                            will not prejudice the aspect of the question in which the Government of
                            the United States is mainly interested, and are not believed to be
                            contrary to the spirit or provisions of the Boundary Waters Treaty of
                            1909, particularly to the provisions contained in Article 4 of that
                            Treaty. The competent authorities of His Majesty’s Government in Canada
                            have had in mind in working out the present scheme of improvement that
                            the excavated material should be so disposed in dikes on each side of
                            the channel that the surface channel or flood way capacity of the river
                            could be increased to receive the additional flood waters from
                            Minnesota, if this action should prove to be necessary at a future date
                            on a recommendation of the International Joint Commission accepted by
                            the Governments of Canada and of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to your note No.
                            269 of November 1, 1927, informing me that no decision has yet been
                            reached by the Canadian Government with regard to this Government’s
                            proposal that the entire problem of the improvement of the drainage of
                            the valley of the Roseau River be referred to the International Joint
                            Commission for investigation, report and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>This Government has given careful consideration to the views expressed in
                            your note. I have to inform you, however, that the information which has
                            been furnished me from sources in the United States is that the
                            execution of the present plans for the improvement of the Roseau River
                            in Canada will have an effect contrary to that which the Canadian
                            authorities have in mind. I am informed that the carrying out of these
                            plans would result in extensive damage by flooding to some eighteen
                            townships in Roseau County, and to a large area in Kittson County,
                            Minnesota. In view of this information, it would seem, that contrary to
                            the views expressed in your note, the construction of the works will
                            prejudice the aspect of the question in which this Government is mainly
                            interested, and that it will be contrary to the spirit and provisions of
                            the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. If the information which has been
                            furnished me is correct, it would seem desirable that the execution of
                            the plans should be deferred until approval thereof has been obtained
                            from the International Joint Commission under Article IV of the
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In view of this conflict of views as to the effect which the execution of
                            the present plans will have, I am strongly of the opinion that the
                            matter is also within the letter and the spirit of Article IX of the
                            Boundary Waters Treaty and suitable for reference to the Commission
                            under that Article by either or both Governments. I, therefore, have the
                            honor to renew the proposal made in the Acting Secretary’s note of
                            February 26, 1927, and repeated in his note of April 2, 1927, that the
                            entire problem of the improvement of the Roseau River system be referred
                            by the Governments of the United States and Canada to the International
                            Joint Commission for investigation, report and recommendations, and that
                            each Government designate an engineer to confer and submit to them a
                            draft of the terms of reference.</p>
                        <p>I further request that all action relative to the carrying out of the
                            present plans for the improvement of the Roseau River be suspended until
                            the International Joint Commission shall have made an investigation and
                            report under such a reference.</p>

                            <p>3. Aliens of all nationalities of the “immigrant” class whose
                                original admission occurred subsequent to June 30, 1924, will be
                                required to meet all provisions of the Immigration Laws applying to
                                aliens of the “immigrant” class. Aliens of this class already
                                enjoying the border crossing privilege, however, will be granted a
                                reasonable time, not to exceed six months from June 1, 1927, within
                                which to obtain immigration visas and otherwise comply with the
                                laws.</p>
                            <p>4. Aliens who have already complied with the requirements of the
                                Immigration Laws and this General Order may be permitted to continue
                                to enjoy the border crossing privilege.</p>
                            <p>5. Aliens who have complied with the requirements of this General
                                Order governing permanent admission will be considered as having
                                entered for permanent residence.</p>
                            <p>6. The use and issuance of identification cards to all classes of

                            <p>7. Identification cards held by or issued to aliens of the

                            <p>9. To insure uniformity stamps furnished by the bureau, only, shall
                                be used and blank spaces, including that for signature, shall be

                            <p>10. All identification cards heretofore issued, held by aliens who
                                can not, or do not, meet the requirements of law, regulations and
                                this order, will be taken up and canceled upon an incoming trip of
                                the holder and appropriate action taken.</p>
                            <p>11. The work of validating outstanding cards should proceed slowly,
                                systematically, steadily and persistently, and in such a manner as
                                to avoid confusion, congestion, interference with proper routine
                                administration and the giving of just grounds for complaint upon the
                                part of the traveling public.</p>
                            <p>12. The status of holders of identification cards shall be inquired
                                into periodically, preferably every six months from date stamped,
                                where practicable, but in any event not less frequently than once a
                                year. When inquiry has been so made, it will be evidenced by a
                                notation to show date of such inquiry and initials of the officer
                                upon the reverse of the card. When the holder of a “nonimmigrant”
                                identification card qualifies as an “immigrant,” a new
                                identification card shall be issued, stamped to show the correct
                                status.</p>

                            changes in the regulations now applicable to persons living in Canada,
                            and crossing daily to the United States to work, especially in the area

                                <item>The Minister of Canada</item>

                        <p>The Secretary made an introductory statement to the Conference in which
                            he pointed out the importance of maintaining the traditional friendly
                            relations which had always existed with Canada. He hoped the conferees
                            would discuss any and all questions arising from travel difficulties on
                            the Canadian border in the friendliest spirit and he wanted the
                            Conference to be sufficiently broad in scope to cover any question on
                            which difficulties might arise with a view to their solution in a way
                            that would maintain our friendly relations with Canada.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0584"/>
                        <p>The Secretary stated further that he hoped the work of the Conference
                            would iron out all difficulties; that he would personally discuss its
                            results with the Secretary of Labor at which discussion he invited the
                            Minister of Canada to be present.</p>
                        <p>Since it was Diplomatic Day, the Secretary then excused himself and the
                            Conference proceeded informally, presided over by Assistant Secretary
                            Carr.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Minister read a prepared statement outlining the widespread
                            adverse effect Labor’s General Order No. 86 has had on the sentiment and
                            economic structure in Canada. He said it is being taken up editorially
                            and by the man on the street in cities far removed from the border and
                            has become, in fact, an acute international issue. He exhibited a copy
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Border Cities Star</hi> which bore a full front
                            page editorial under one-inch headlines, “An Unfriendly Act of a
                            Friendly Nation” and presented other clippings similar in tone from
                            Quebec and other interior cities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wrong went further into details and suggested that under Labor’s own
                            definition—”an alien who, having a fixed domicile in some other country
                            which he has no intention to abandon, comes to the United States for a
                            temporary period only”—the border-crossers were in the category of
                            non-immigrants.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White outlined the position of the Department of Labor at some
                            length. He said that ever since July 1, 1924, Labor had been seeking a
                            means to curtail the border-crossing privileges and was now driven by
                            pressure from organized labor to a definite announcement of its program
                            of control of border crossing by workers. He said these people who
                            entered the United States solely for purposes of work and took the
                            places of American workers were not contemplated by Congress as coming
                            within the non-immigrant class.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then became general and centered around the number of
                            persons who, under Labor’s Order, would be required to present quota
                            immigration visas. It was submitted by the representatives of Canada
                            that these persons caused them the greatest concern since they were over
                            90% British-born and as much the responsibility of the Canadian
                            Government as native-born Canadians. Each group had certain statistics
                            which seemed to indicate that between 4000 and 6000 such persons were
                            involved. It was pointed out that while this number was but a drop in
                            the bucket as far as the American labor market was concerned, each
                            individual, when thrown out of employment and forced to stay in Canada
                            would become the nucleus of unfriendly feeling against the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The time within which these people might hope to receive visas under
                            their respective quotas was discussed. Our system of allotment
                            proportional to demand was explained and also the fact that <pb n="499"
                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0585"/>obligations had been created in very
                            large numbers both in England and in Canada by registrations on the part
                            of prospective quota immigrants who had not hitherto enjoyed any border
                            crossing privileges and who could not be set aside in favor of those who
                            had. Statistics were adduced to show that a six-months period for the
                            production of quota visas could not be considered as meeting the
                            situation in the slightest degree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White pointed out that the six-months period was not expected by
                            Labor officials to be an adequate period, but rather to be a period in
                            which the situation would clarify itself; the definition of a period
                            (any period) after which quota visas must be produced being the only
                            actual curtailment in the number of foreign workers enjoying employment
                            in the United States, and, consequently, the only actual benefit
                            accorded to the A. F. of L. He stated that it was also conceived as a
                            period of readjustment—a period during which due notice having been
                            served, non-Canadian border crossing workers would secure employment on
                            the Canadian side of the border.</p>
                        <p>The Conference adjourned at 12:50 p.m. after agreeing that notices to the
                            press should be limited to the statement that this was a preliminary
                            session only and no announcement of its results could be made.</p>
                        <p>Tentatively, with the understanding that Mr. White would discuss them
                            with the Secretary of Labor, the following three points were agreed upon
                            a$ being the lines along which a solution might be reached: <list>

                                <item>Cease, as from the date of General Order No. 86, from the

                                <item>Continue in effect the privileges hitherto granted until the
                                    individuals in each class involved may either bring themselves
                                    within the Act of 1924<note n="25" xml:id="d363fn25">43 Stat.

                                    is disposed to grant any further measure of freedom in travel
                                    across our land borders than is permitted by the present
                                    law.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to your notes
                            dated April 23 and April 27, 1927,<note n="26" xml:id="d364fn26">Note of
                                April 27 not printed.</note> and to a conference at the Department
                            on May 12, in which you so ably presented the difficulties in which
                            certain citizens <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0586"/>of Canada will
                            find themselves as a result of General Order Number 86 of the Department
                            of Labor which relates to the daily crossing of the Canadian boundary to
                            employment in the United States. I wish to assure you at the outset of
                            the sincere desire on the part of this Government to continue the
                            traditional freedom of mutual travel between Canada and the United
                            States just a$ fully and completely as the provisions of the laws of
                            this country relating to immigration will permit.</p>
                        <p>While it is realized that the law upon which General Order Number 86 is
                            based, mandatorily modifies a long established practice, I should
                            appreciate it if you would note that every effort was made in drafting
                            that order to afford the most generous treatment possible under the law
                            to all persons who acquired border crossing privileges before the
                            effective date of the present Immigration Act of 1924. Further, every
                            possible opportunity will be given to native-born Canadians to acquire
                            legal status in the United States by the presentation of a non-quota
                            visa and the single payment of the head tax in accordance with
                            provisions of our immigration laws which are mandatory. The
                            border-crossing privileges hitherto accorded such persons will be
                            continued during such period as is necessary for them to obtain
                            non-quota visas.</p>
                        <p>We are agreed, I think, that the main difficulty lies with the Canadian
                            residents who are not native-born Canadians and who have acquired
                            border-crossing privileges since the quota system became effective. It
                            is appreciated that such persons are none the less the responsibility of
                            your Government even though our immigration law, which, unlike Orders in
                            Council, may not be modified except by act of the Congress, gives them a
                            less favorable status than persons born in Canada. You will doubtless
                            recall that the Immigration Act of 1921<note n="27" xml:id="d364fn27">42
                                Stat. 5.</note> placed foreign born persons who had resided in
                            Canada one year upon an equality with natives of Canada with respect to
                            entry into the United States; the same Act as extended and modified by
                            the Act of 1922<note n="28" xml:id="d364fn28">42 Stat. 540.</note>
                            increased the necessary period of residence to five years; while the
                            Immigration Act of 1924 denied the non-quota privileges to Canadian
                            residents born outside of Canada and made them chargeable to the quotas
                            of the countries in which they were born. It is among the non-Canadian
                            born who are quota aliens that the Order will cause some hardship. The
                            number involved is not yet accurately known and the competent
                            authorities express the belief that it will be found to be comparatively
                            small. It is recognized nevertheless, that many persons within this
                            class, through their inability to obtain quota visas within the
                            prescribed period, will, under the terms of the Order, be <pb n="501"
                                xml:id="pg_501" facs="0587"/>forced to relinquish employment in the
                            United States which in certain cases they have enjoyed for a number of
                            years. This would, I admit, constitute a hardship which I sincerely
                            regret. I am sure you will appreciate that the large number of prior
                            applicants whose desire to emigrate to the United States has been on
                            record for some time at the Consulates in Europe and elsewhere and who
                            must receive visas within the limited national quotas can not be
                            deprived of the priority rights gained by such registration in favor of
                            a particular group in any border city. Apart from the consideration that
                            the law does not permit the creation of preferential classes in the
                            discretion of the executive, fair dealing dictates that the obligations
                            created by prior applications be scrupulously met.</p>
                        <p>In order to make sure that no unnecessary hardship shall be imposed upon
                            persons in this category, consuls in the border cities have been
                            directed to assist them in every possible way to obtain immigration
                            visas under the provisions of the immigration law. The consuls will at
                            once undertake the classification and listing of such persons in the
                            course of which, if it appears that any individual is inadmissible to
                            the United States or is chargeable to a quota against which the prior
                            recorded demand is exceedingly heavy, he will be informed of his
                            situation in order that he may make his plans accordingly. Those who
                            obviously can not hope to receive immigration visas for some time to
                            come because they are chargeable to small European quotas against which
                            large demands now exist will be clearly informed of their status. In
                            other words, a sincere endeavor will be made to reduce the uncertainties
                            of the situation to the minimum.</p>
                        <p>The issue of quota visas will begin immediately after July 1 against
                            allotments of quota numbers from the appropriate quotas which will be as
                            large as prior applications against the quotas will permit and will
                            proceed at the maximum rate allowed by the law. Before the expiration of
                            the time limit specified in Order Number 86, within which aliens of this
                            class must present quota visas, it will probably be found that all who
                            have hitherto held border-crossing permits issued to them by the
                            Department of Labor since the quota system became effective, will not,
                            by reason of the numerical restrictions of the quota law, be able to
                            receive immigration visas. Should this prove to be the case, I shall be
                            glad at once to request the Secretary of Labor to allow further time in
                            which these people may gain a status in conformity with the law and the
                            Secretary has already assured me that any such request will receive the
                            most sympathetic consideration possible.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I shall be glad to confer with you whenever you desire it, and
                            I am directing the officers of this Department to keep in touch with
                            your Legation and to continue their studies of the subject <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0588"/>with a view to clearing away, so far as
                            can be done under existing law, all difficulties and dissatisfaction in
                            regard to border crossing. Should these studies indicate that there are
                            difficulties inherent in the law which tend to affect adversely the
                            traditional friendly relations between Canada and this country, I shall
                            make it a point to have the matter brought to the attention of the
                            Congress when it convenes, and the Secretary of Labor assures me that he
                            will cooperate to this end.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your Note dated May 28th. 1927, regarding the operation of
                            General Order Number 86 of the Department of Labor of the United States.
                            In so doing I desire to thank you for the careful and courteous
                            consideration given by you and your officials to this subject at the
                            conference held at the Department of State on May 12th. and on
                            subsequent occasions.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed to inform you that His Majesty’s Canadian Government is
                            pleased to note that the Government of the United States desires to
                            continue the traditional freedom of mutual travel between Canada and the
                            United States. His Majesty’s Canadian Government is gratified by your
                            assurance that in the administration of this Order steps will be taken
                            to avoid inflicting hardship on individuals so far as may be possible,
                            and more particularly by your undertaking to ask the Secretary of Labor
                            to extend the time set in the Order during which those who have to
                            secure quota visas must comply with its terms, if it should become
                            evident that these persons will be unable to secure quota visas by
                            December 1st. 1927. The assurance of the Secretary of Labor that he will
                            give to such a request the most sympathetic consideration possible is
                            also noted with gratification. His Majesty’s Canadian Government is
                            pleased to learn that you and the Secretary of Labor are prepared to
                            co-operate in bringing to the attention of the Congress any difficulties
                            inherent in the law which may be indicated by a further investigation of
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Canadian Government, however, regrets that the Government
                            of the United States has not considered it possible to modify in any
                            respect the terms of the Order at the present time, and that, in
                            consequence, a long-standing and reciprocal arrangement between the two
                            countries has been suddenly terminated. I have the honour to <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0589"/>lay before you, for the purpose of
                            record, the views of His Majesty’s Canadian Government on the issues
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>For many years there has been reciprocal free movement over the border
                            between the United States and Canada, a movement freer and involving a
                            larger number of people than that between any other two countries in the
                            world. This freedom of movement has been an outstanding demonstration of
                            the close connection and friendship existing between the people of the
                            two countries. The boundary is of such a character that the communities
                            situated close to it on both sides must have many common interests. In
                            some of these border communities the relationship has been so intimate
                            that residents on one side of the frontier have been in the habit of
                            crossing daily to the other side to engage in employment. This practice,
                            as you are aware, is of many years standing. The Convention known as
                            Jay’s Treaty, concluded in 1794,<note n="29" xml:id="d365fn29">Miller,

                            in Article 3:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is agreed that it shall at all times be free to His Majesty’s
                                    subjects and to the citizens of the United States and also to
                                    the Indians dwelling on either side of the boundary line freely
                                    to pass and repass by land or inland navigation into the
                                    respective territories and countries of the two parties on the
                                    Continent of America.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The broad principle which underlay this provision is clearly indicated in
                            the statement contained in the concluding paragraph of the same
                            Article:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“This Article is intended to render in a great degree the local
                                    advantages of each party common to both and thereby to promote a
                                    disposition favourable to friendship and good
                                    neighbourhood.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The practice rooted in this understanding and in the unique conditions of
                            border intercourse on this Continent has continued to this day. It has
                            been most marked in the area adjacent to Windsor and Detroit and in the
                            Niagara region. Though a large majority of the individuals who so cross
                            the border daily are Canadians entering the United States, the practice
                            is reciprocal, and a considerable number of citizens of the United
                            States come to Canada each working day.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian authorities have always treated, and continue to treat,
                            citizens of the United States entering Canada in this way as
                            non-immigrants domiciled in the United States. The Government of the
                            United States has until lately similarly regarded Canadians crossing
                            daily to the United States, and has made regulations to facilitate their
                            crossing the boundary by the issue of identification cards to these
                            persons, whom they describe as “aliens who habitually cross and recross
                            the boundary upon legitimate pursuits.”</p>
                        <p>In the Windsor area, however, particularly during the last few months,
                            the status of Canadians so situated has become increasingly <pb n="504"
                                xml:id="pg_504" facs="0590"/>uncertain, especially the status of
                            those who are not of Canadian birth. Many either have been definitely
                            turned back at the border, or have been required to pay head tax and to
                            secure immigration visas. The publication of General Order Number 86 has
                            suddenly ended this growing uncertainty by providing that hereafter all
                            who are employed in the United States while living in Canada are to be
                            considered as immigrants to the United States.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Canadian Government does not question, of course, the right
                            of the Government of the United States to determine what persons may be
                            admitted to the United States. They wish, however, to express their view
                            that the ending, without notice or negotiation, of this long-standing
                            arrangement, under which economic interests have developed and
                            communities have grown up in Canada dependent in part on employment in
                            the United States, is a legitimate ground for concern. Ten years have
                            elapsed since the passage by the Congress of the United States of the
                            Immigration Act of 1917, and three years since the passage of the
                            supplementary Act of 1924; no new legislation has been enacted since
                            1924 which affects the status of those who cross the border in this way,
                            and the practice has been permitted to continue until the present time.
                            The Order now applies for the first time to those who cross the border
                            daily the provisions of the Act of 1924, three years after its
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>As regards the general principle of the Order, the definition as an
                            “immigrant” of one who is permanently domiciled in Canada and who enters
                            the United States for a period of only eight or ten hours each working
                            day, appears to be a departure from the ordinary meaning of the term,
                            and seems to give to it a special sense in contradiction to customary
                            usage. Immigration is generally considered to involve a change of
                            domicile, and no other instance is known in which persons who retain in
                            full their legal domicile and citizenship in one country are, at the
                            same time, treated as immigrants to another country. In the view of His
                            Majesty’s Canadian Government, the interpretation of the term
                            “immigrant” carried out in the practice which has been in force between
                            Canada and the United States for many years is eminently fair and
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p>Certain exceptions to the operation of General Order Number 86 are made
                            in Section 2 of the Order, by which the individuals who come within four
                            specified classes are to continue to be admitted upon payment of head
                            tax only. I understand that these exceptions are made to mitigate the
                            hardship caused to individuals who began crossing the border before the
                            passage of the Immigration Act of 1924. In Section 3 of the Order, all
                            who have begun to cross the border since June 30, 1924, are given “a
                            reasonable time, not to exceed six <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505"
                                facs="0591"/>months from June 1, 1927, within which to obtain
                            immigration visas and otherwise comply with the laws”. I am instructed
                            to represent that for those who have to secure quota immigration visas
                            the period of six months can hardly be regarded as “a reasonable time”,
                            except perhaps in a small number of cases in which the persons’ names
                            have for some time been on the waiting list for quota visas. As you
                            already are aware, it is for those citizens of Canada who have to secure
                            quota visas, numbering probably between four and six thousand, that His
                            Majesty’s Canadian Government feels an especial concern.</p>
                        <p>The laws of Canada make no distinction between citizens of Canadian birth
                            and those of British or foreign birth who have acquired citizenship by
                            domicile or naturalization, just as the laws of the United States make
                            no distinction between native born and naturalized citizens. Unless some
                            modification is made now or later, the effect of this Order will
                            undoubtedly be to exclude from the United States the very large majority
                            of these four to six thousand Canadian citizens who will be unable to
                            secure quota visas before December 1, 1927. The number of persons
                            seriously affected is a very small proportion of the population either
                            of Canada or of the United States, but in the Windsor area it represents
                            a very substantial percentage of the population of all ages, probably
                            about fifteen per cent. In this area particularly the sudden dislocation
                            of long established relations could hardly fail to have grave
                            results.</p>
                        <p>The view of His Majesty’s Canadian Government on the general principle of
                            the Order has already been stated. With regard to its particular
                            provisions, it is felt that in equity ample protection should be given
                            to all who have been in the habit of crossing the border to work,
                            irrespective of the date at which they began the practice, either by the
                            extension of the exempted classes in Section 2, or by the elimination of
                            the six months’ time limit in Section 3, or by some other means. The
                            interpretation given to the Immigration Act of 1924 up to the present
                            time has encouraged the belief that the daily crossing of the border to
                            employment in the United States was not affected by this Act. The
                            retroactive aspect of the Order in excluding individuals who have been
                            previously permitted by the Immigration authorities to enter the United
                            States cannot, therefore, fail to cause ill-feeling and to work great
                            hardship.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to accept the invitation which you cordially extend in
                            the last paragraph of your Note to co-operate with your Department in
                            studying these and other border-crossing difficulties; and I trust that
                            in consequence a mutually satisfactory arrangement may be arrived at
                            before long. In conclusion I take pleasure in assuring you that His
                            Majesty’s Canadian Government fully appreciates your <pb n="506"

                            States and Canada.</p>

                            those affected by this Order, I have the honour to submit below a list

                            <p>“1. What is the status under the Order of Canadians born in countries
                                to which the quota applies who began to cross the border between
                                June 3rd, 1921, and June 30, 1924, and who did not have the
                                requisite residence qualifications at the time of their first
                                admission to qualify under the provisions of Section 2 C and D of
                                the Order?</p>
                            <p>“A. The Order contemplates that where residence is a requisite, such
                                residence must have obtained at the time of original admission.</p>
                            <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0594"/>

                                payment of head tax and by the presentation of visas when necessary,
                                be able to continue to cross the border indefinitely without being
                                required to pay head tax and to secure visas a second time?</p>
                            <p>“A. Persons who comply with the provisions of the Order are admitted
                                as immigrants, and the immigration rules and regulations governing
                                what constitutes abandonment of status, exemption from repayment of
                                head tax, etc., for aliens so admitted are applicable.</p>
                            <p>“3. Will persons who comply with the provisions of this Order at some
                                future date be able to live in Canada and cross the border daily to
                                work?</p>
                            <p>“A. The answer to the preceding question would seem to answer this
                                query.</p>
                            <p>“4. Will a person who is permitted under this Order to cross the
                                border daily, and who at some future date changes his employment in
                                the United States from one employer to another, be permitted to
                                continue to cross the border?</p>
                            <p>“A. This question would also appear to be answered by the foregoing,
                                the nature and place of employment being a matter of no particular
                                concern.</p>
                            <p>“5. What will be the status under the Immigration Laws of the United
                                States of persons permitted to cross the border under Section 2 of
                                the Order? Will they be considered to have been admitted as
                                immigrants to the United States?</p>
                            <p>“A. This question is answered in the affirmative. In fact, the whole
                                tenor of the Order deals with such persons as immigrants and not as
                                visitors.</p>
                            <p>“6. What is the meaning of the phrase at the end of the first
                                paragraph of Section 2 ‘provided that they are not coming to seek
                                employment’?</p>
                            <p>“A. The exemptions in the Order apply only to aliens entering in
                                pursuance of existing employment, and not to persons seeking
                                employment.</p>
                            <p>“7. If a person permitted to cross the border under Section 2 of the
                                Order ceases in the future to cross the border, will he be permitted
                                to resume the practice at a later date?</p>
                            <p>“A. This question is answered under query No. 2.</p>

                            May 28th. 1927 and to my reply thereto of June 8th, regarding the
                            operation of General <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0595"/>Order
                            Number 86 of the Department of Labor of the United States, and also to
                            the numerous conversations which have taken place between members of
                            your Department and this Legation on this subject. In the course of your
                            note you were kind enough to employ the following language: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“Before the expiration of the time limit
                                    specified in Order Number 86, within which aliens of this class
                                    must present quota visas, it will probably be found that all who
                                    have hitherto held border-crossing permits issued to them by the
                                    Department of Labor since the quota system became effective,
                                    will not, by reason of the numerical restrictions of the quota
                                    law, be able to receive immigration visas. Should this prove to
                                    be the case, I shall be glad at once to request the Secretary of
                                    Labor to allow further time in which these people may gain a
                                    status in conformity with the law and the Secretary has already
                                    assured me that any such request will receive the most
                                    sympathetic consideration possible.”</p>

                        <p>The time limit of December 1st. which was set in this Order is now only a
                            few days away. It has become apparent that a considerable number of
                            Canadian citizens, who have been freely permitted to cross the border
                            daily to employment under permits issued to them by the Department of
                            Labor, are unable to comply with the terms of the Order because they
                            were born abroad, and cannot secure immigration visas chargeable to the
                            quotas of their countries of birth by December 1st. I understand that
                            there are registered at the various United States Consulates at border
                            points, the names of some three thousand individuals who have been in
                            the habit of crossing the border to employment, and who have applied
                            without success for the issue of quota immigration visas. These three
                            thousand individuals are therefore in the most imminent danger of being
                            deprived of their means of livelihood.</p>
                        <p>I therefore venture to suggest that the time has come when the assurances
                            made in the second of the sentences which are quoted above from your
                            note, should be put into effect. I need not emphasize the desirability
                            of reaching a rapid decision, nor the difficulties which will be
                            incurred at the points principally affected, if no relief is afforded
                            before December 1st. The view of His Majesty’s Government in Canada, as
                            expressed to you in my note of June 8th, remains unchanged. It sincerely
                            hopes that you may find it possible to inform me immediately that the
                            effects of the Order have been so modified as to permit at least those
                            who have applied for immigration visas without being able to secure
                            them, to continue to cross the border without difficulty.</p>
                        <p>You will doubtless note that I am now only requesting relief for those
                            who have taken all steps in their power to comply with the terms of the
                            Order. In your note of May 28th. you stated that the compulsory <pb
                                n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0596"/>relinquishment by such persons
                            of their employment in the United States, which they may have enjoyed
                            for a number of years, would constitute a hardship which you sincerely
                            regretted. I have every confidence that you will take all steps to avoid
                            the infliction of this hardship, and to arrive at an equitable solution
                            of this problem.</p>

                            281 of November 26, 1927, and to recent conferences held with you at the
                            Department upon the subject of relief for those residents of Canada
                            crossing the border daily for employment in the United States who have
                            applied for quota immigration visas but who have been unable to obtain
                            them prior to December 1, 1927, the time limit specified in General
                            Order No. 86 of the Department of Labor within which they were to
                            present such visas.</p>
                        <p>As you have already been informed, it has been found possible to grant a
                            substantial measure of relief to the aliens in question by arranging
                            that those who have gone as far as they could in order to comply with
                            the terms of General Order No. 86, by registering as applicants for
                            visas at the American Consulates on the border prior to December 1,
                            1927, shall have priority status as of the date when they were accorded
                            the border-crossing privilege. It is believed that they will thus be
                            able to obtain their visas and to satisfy the requirements of the
                            American immigration laws as fast as their examination can take place by
                            the immigration authorities on the American side of the border, they
                            continuing meanwhile to enjoy their border-crossing privileges. This
                            relief is afforded in an effort to remedy any injustice that may have
                            been suffered by this class of quota aliens due to the probability that
                            they understood prior to the promulgation of General Order No. 86, that
                            they had complied with American law when they had applied for and
                            obtained border-crossing permits and that it was not necessary for them
                            to apply also for immigration visas.</p>
                        <p>The Departments of State and Labor believe that the situation which was
                            created by General Order No. 86 has, as a whole, largely disappeared, so
                            many adjustments in individual cases having been made under the terms of
                            the Order during the six months’ period afforded for that purpose which
                            ended November 30, 1927. The change made in the priority status of quota
                            commuters who have been unable to obtain visas, although having
                            registered as visa applicants <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0597"
                            />prior to December 1, 1927, will, it is believed, afford all needed
                            relief in those cases. Commuters born in Canada, on the other hand, may
                            obtain non-quota visas upon application at a consulate and satisfying
                            the consul as to their birth in Canada and their admissibility to this
                            country under its immigration laws.</p>

                            attention to the fact that pike-perch in Lake Champlain, which annually
                            migrate to the Canadian waters of Missisquoi Bay at the northern end of
                            the Lake for the purpose of spawning, are being taken with seines under
                            licenses issued by the Canadian authorities. The spawning season usually
                            lasts from about March first to April fifteenth and it is understood
                            that the licenses are issued for this period, although it has been
                            reported that individuals continue illegally to fish with seines until
                            well along into the month of May. During this time when the fish are
                            passing into the Canadian waters they are taken in very large quantities
                            without having had an opportunity to spawn, thus serving to destroy in
                            large measure the future supply of this valuable food fish.</p>

                            following statement with reference to the protection of the fisheries of
                            Lake Champlain: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“At the Boston hearings representatives from the States of New
                                    York and Vermont appeared to urge better protection of the
                                    fisheries in Missisquoi Bay, the Canadian portion of Lake
                                    Champlain. This matter had received preliminary consideration by
                                    the conference during its sittings in Washington, D. C.</p>
                                <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0598"/>
                                <p>“It was explained that for some years past these two States, with
                                    the cooperation and assistance of the Federal Government, were
                                    endeavoring to make Lake Champlain a favorite tourist resort,
                                    as, owing to its character, it could not support any extensive
                                    commercial fishing. To this end both States were prohibiting all
                                    net fishing, but the most important spawning grounds for
                                    pike-perch, the most valuable fish in the lake, are in the
                                    portion thereof that is in Canadian territory, and there each
                                    spring, when the fish crowd into these waters to spawn, they are
                                    caught with, seines. Thus the good effects of the work of the
                                    two States were being largely nullified.</p>
                                <p>“It was also explained that the United States Bureau of Fisheries
                                    operates a pike-perch hatchery on the lake and that it was
                                    prepared to enlarge the hatchery and increase its work if the
                                    net fishing were stopped.</p>
                                <p>“While this matter was not explicitly referred to the conference
                                    for consideration, it was one of which it could take cognizance.
                                    It was, therefore, left with the Canadian delegation for such
                                    action as they felt justified in taking.</p>
                                <p>“Following the return of the Canadian section to Ottawa, after
                                    hearings at St. John, it laid the facts before the Canadian
                                    Government, and recommended that all net fishing in Missisquoi
                                    Bay should be stopped. This recommendation was approved, and the
                                    fishery regulations for the Province of Quebec were amended
                                    accordingly by Order in Council of February 18, 1918.” (Page

                        <p>The amendment, prohibiting net fishing in Missisquoi Bay and in the
                            Canadian waters of Lake Champlain, was later incorporated in an Order in
                            Council of October 22, 1921, which in turn was rescinded by a subsequent
                            Order in Council, dated March 1, 1922.</p>
                        <p>Since the promulgation of the Order in Council of March 1, 1922, it
                            appears that net fishing has been authorized in Missisquoi Bay under
                            licenses issued by Canadian authorities, and that at the present time
                            fish are being gathered in by seines night and day.</p>
                        <p>The harmful effect which this seining is having upon the Lake Champlain
                            Fishery is apparent.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, therefore, to express the hope that you will present
                            the matter to the Government of Canada and ascertain whether that
                            Government would be willing to cooperate with this Government in
                            conserving this fishery by prohibiting net fishing in the Canadian
                            waters during the spawning season. If the prohibition inaugurated by the
                            Order in Council of February 18, 1918, were reestablished by the
                            Canadian authorities, it would be a source of gratitude to the United
                            States and particularly to the people living in the vicinity of Lake
                            Champlain, who feel greatly aggrieved at the existing practice. It is
                            suggested that the furtherance of good will which discontinuance of the
                            seining would occasion would no doubt outweigh the economic loss to
                            individuals who have profited from the seining operations. Since this
                            Government understands <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0599"/>that the
                            operations complained of are now being vigorously prosecuted, it is
                            hopeful that the Canadian authorities may see their way clear to take
                            immediate action in the premises. I shall appreciate it if you will
                            inform me as soon as feasible as to the disposition of the Canadian
                            Government in this matter.</p>

                            711.428/1020 of April 13th last regarding the pike-perch fisheries in
                            Lake Champlain, I have the honour to inform you at the request of the
                            Government of Canada, that enquiries made through the Department of the
                            Province of Quebec which administers fisheries in that area, indicate
                            that while some illegal fishing was attempted in April, the seines and
                            other apparatus were immediately seized and an official of the
                            Department, who has since made a thorough investigation, has reported
                            that conditions are now entirely satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>As set forth in your note under reference, the question of prohibiting
                            seining in the Missisquoi Bay was considered by the Canadian-American
                            Fisheries Conference of 1918, and in anticipation of the different
                            questions that had been referred by the two Governments to the
                            Conference being settled by the acceptance of its report by both
                            Governments, a regulation was adopted by Order in Council of February
                            18th, 1918, prohibiting fishing by means of nets of any kind in
                            Missisquoi Bay. This regulation was maintained in the face of growing
                            objection to it until March 1st, 1922, up to which time the
                            recommendations of the Conference, though they had been approved by the
                            Canadian Government, had not been approved by that of the United States
                            and there was no immediate indication that they would be.</p>
                        <p>Missisquoi Bay is in the Province of Quebec, where the fisheries are
                            being administered by the Provincial authorities, which consequently
                            issue any licenses which authorize fishing there. The statement in your
                            note abovementioned that it has been reported that individuals continue
                            to fish in the Bay during the close season is being communicated to the
                            Provincial authorities for proper attention.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that the Treaty of 1908 for the regulation of the
                            fisheries in boundary waters<note n="32" xml:id="d371fn32"><ref

                            Missisquoi Bay, but other waters as well. The regulations adopted by the
                            Commission <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0600"/>appointed under that
                            Treaty failed to receive the approval of the United States Senate and so
                            did not become effective.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the above, the Dominion Government are of the opinion
                            that the situation should be dealt with as a whole rather than that
                            Missisquoi Bay should be considered by itself.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to invite your attention
                            to the situation regarding pike perch fisheries in Lake Champlain which
                            in former years has been a subject of correspondence between the
                            Department and the British Embassy. In note No. 393 of June 7, 1926, the
                            Ambassador stated that it was the Canadian Government’s view that
                            fishing in boundary waters should be considered as a whole rather than
                            that the fishing in Missisquoi Bay should be considered separately.</p>
                        <p>While this Government appreciates the Dominion Government’s position as
                            set out in the Ambassador’s note, it believes that the interests of the
                            people on both sides of the international boundary require the
                            discontinuance of seine fishing in Missisquoi Bay, independent of the
                            solution of questions relating to fisheries in other boundary waters.
                            This Government understands that in the Lake Champlain region the
                            interests of the summer angler are of greater financial importance to
                            the resident people than market fisheries could be. You will recall that
                            the American-Canadian Fisheries Conference of 1918 found that the work
                            of the States of New York and Vermont directed toward the building up of
                            the Lake Champlain region as a summer resort was being “largely
                            nullified” by seine fishing in the Canadian part of Missisquoi Bay. The
                            benefits of the fish hatcheries in the American section of the Lake are
                            likewise impaired by the seine fishing.</p>
                        <p>This Government appreciates the importance of adequately protecting and
                            regulating fishing in all the boundary waters through the cooperation of
                            the governments of the United States and Canada. It is a matter of
                            regret to it that questions of a local nature have delayed it in
                            undertaking negotiations in regard to the fisheries in certain waters.
                            However, this Government is hopeful that in respect of the fisheries in
                            every part of the boundary waters in relation to which no serious
                            questions have arisen the Dominion Government will find it possible to
                            cooperate in the preservation of the permanent interests of the people
                            immediately concerned.</p>

                        <p>In view of the opening of the season in which seine fishing in Lake
                            Champlain has been permitted, which is now approaching, I have the honor
                            to request that you bring the views of this Government to the attention
                            of the Government of Canada with the suggestion that, if the Dominion
                            Government finds it practicable to prohibit the use of seines in
                            Missisquoi Bay, this Government will appreciate such action being

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your note No.
                            711.428/1072 of March 1st. on the subject of the pike perch fisheries in
                            Lake Champlain, I have the honour to state that the competent Department
                            of the Dominion Government which has had the matter under consideration,
                            represents that the conditions affecting the situation in Lake Champlain
                            remain unchanged, such conditions being briefly outlined in the
                            following manner.</p>
                        <p>It is explained that the fisheries of Missisquoi Bay are the property of
                            the province of Quebec and are being administered by the Provincial
                            authorities, who are opposed to the prohibition of a reasonable amount
                            of seine fishing in the Bay, though while pike perch or pickerel resort
                            to the Bay for spawning purposes fishing for them is prohibited during
                            the spawning season. While the exclusive power to make regulations in
                            all parts of Canada rests with the Federal Government, in an area where
                            the fisheries are owned and are being administered by the Provincial
                            authorities, the Federal Government hesitates to impose regulations that
                            are not desired by the Provincial authorities unless the conditions are
                            extraordinary in their character.</p>
                        <p>Although the question of fishery regulations in Lake Champlain was not
                            referred to the Canadian American Fisheries Conference in 1918, it was
                            brought to the attention of the Conference by delegations representing
                            the States of New York and Vermont, and indeed the question was raised
                            by the American members of the Conference at its preliminary sittings.
                            It was at the time anticipated that the recommendations of the
                            Conference would be approved by both countries, and accordingly as the
                            fishing season was then approaching, on the recommendation of the
                            Canadian members of the Conference to their Government, a regulation was
                            adopted in February 1918, prohibiting all net fishing in Missisquoi Bay.
                            The Conference completed its work and submitted its report in September
                            1918, and its recommendations were subsequently approved by the Canadian
                                <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0602"/>Government, though such
                            approval was not given by the United States Government. The regulation
                            was, however, maintained in the face of continuously growing opposition
                            until March 1922, when it was annulled as there was no indication at
                            that time that the recommendations of the Conference would be
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>Attention is further called by the Department to the fact that the
                            Missisquoi Bay situation was covered by the Treaty of 1908 for the
                            regulation of the fisheries in boundary waters, but that the regulations
                            drawn up by the Commission appointed under that Treaty failed to receive
                            the approval of the United States Senate.</p>
                        <p>After consideration of all circumstances, the Canadian Government is
                            still of opinion that the Missisquoi Bay situation should be dealt with
                            in connection with other outstanding matters and not by itself and I am
                            accordingly requested in bringing their views to the notice of the
                            United States Government, to take advantage of the opportunity to dwell
                            upon the importance of early attention being given to the settlement of
                            the outstanding fishery questions between the two countries.</p>

                            Chile to proceed to the negotiation with the United States of a similar
                            treaty. A special draft will, of course, be prepared for presentation to
                            Chile if this proposal is acceptable to the Chilean Government. It is
                            probable that certain departures from the text of the German treaty
                            should be made either in the special text to be submitted to the
                            Government of Chile or, on behalf of either party, during the course of

                        <p>It would be gratifying if, among its early treaties embodying the

                            States could celebrate a general commercial treaty with Chile. The lack
                            of a general commercial treaty with Chile since the Convention of Peace,

                            this connection that a most-favored-nation clause with a condition, such
                            as that contained in the first sentence of Article II of the Treaty of
                            1832, would not now be acceptable to the United States.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, though the Department, in proposing a
                            treaty with Chile, is influenced chiefly by its policy of concluding
                            with other countries generally treaties containing the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation clause, you are nevertheless desired to use especial
                            diligence in seeking a favorable response from the Chilean Government,
                            thus forestalling any efforts that other countries may be planning to
                            make for the purpose of interposing in South America arrangements based
                            upon special privilege—a policy wholly antagonistic to the policy of
                            equality of treatment which the United States is undertaking to promote.
                            You may recall in this connection that in 1923 this Government renounced
                            the preferential customs treatment which certain American products had
                            been receiving in Brazil and requested instead a pledge of equal footing
                            with other countries in the Brazilian market.<note n="8"

                        <p>For your further confidential information and guidance, the Department
                            was informed some time ago that there was a movement on the part of
                            Spain to seek from the countries of Latin America special commercial
                            concessions in return for certain advantages to be accorded to their
                            commerce in Spain. In this connection see the Department’s circular
                            instruction dated April 19, 1926.<note n="9" xml:id="d375fn9">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Reference is made confidentially to the Embassy’s despatch No. 346 of
                            December 20, 1923, which touched <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> on
                            the possibility that the Chilean Government would desire some exception
                            to the most favored nation clause covering either the Latin American
                            countries as a whole or, more specifically, Bolivia and Argentina. While
                            it would appear inadvisable to raise the question of exceptions in any
                            discussions with the Chilean Government, the Department suggests that,
                            in case Chilean officials should introduce the matter, you might assume
                            an attitude of discouraging the exemption of any large group of
                            countries, and in case the suggestion is made that one or two specific
                            countries should be exempted, you might state that you will report the
                            matter to Washington. You will of course avoid any commitment.</p>
                        <p>The Department either has transmitted or expects at an early date to
                            transmit instructions, similar to the present instruction, to the
                            American missions in the other South American capitals except Ecuador,

                            United States, and, at least for the present, Panama, with which there
                            remains pending an important treaty of a different character.<note

                        <p>146. Minister of Foreign Affairs after studying German treaty is willing
                            to negotiate on those general conditions but says Bolivia would have to
                            be excepted because of economic situation and existing treaties and
                            future political reconciliation. Last night Under Secretary told me both
                            Peru and Bolivia would have to be excepted but Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs mentioned only Bolivia. I told Under Secretary exception was too
                            great. Minister of Foreign Affairs said he would have to create a
                            commission on which Minister of Hacienda <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520"
                                facs="0606"/>and Minister of Fomento would be represented. …
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs said he would discuss matter with two
                            colleagues mentioned and perhaps could give me a memorandum Monday, but
                            when I asked if he would like to have you prepare a draft treaty he said
                            yes enthusiastically. I suggest you rush it to me unless you can cable
                            me what to draft by reference to German treaty. I have presented matter
                            in such a manner that Minister of Foreign Affairs almost thinks he
                            suggested it and I believe I have convinced him that to conclude a
                            treaty would cover him with glory. [Paraphrase.] He informed me that he
                            had recently negotiated commercial conventions with Germany and Spain.
                            [End paraphrase.] I do not believe this is generally known. He assured
                            me that nothing in them would prevent entering into treaty with us along
                            these lines, that there is no favor granted that would be obstacle to
                            our negotiations. I think I have inspired Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            with desire to negotiate at once and it is barely possible that a treaty
                            could be concluded in time to submit to Congress at its special session
                            which it is now thought will convene on October 17th.</p>
                        <p>I do not think any treaty can be concluded unless Bolivia is excepted and
                            it is likely that Congress will insist Peru also be excepted. Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs thinks congressional discussion would make it
                            impossible to conclude a treaty in less than two months. Under Secretary
                            says six months because of necessity of consulting Chamber of Commerce
                            for promoting national industry, et cetera.</p>

                        <p>161. Your telegram 52, October 14, 7 p.m. Am uncertain whether the
                            Department wishes me to submit draft of commercial treaty to the Foreign
                            Office as stated in two places or whether it wishes this withheld
                            pending further instructions as distinctly stated in end of message.
                            Please cable instructions.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs tells me Minister of Hacienda and new
                            Minister of Fomento or Promotion are considering the treaty in
                            principle. Minister of Hacienda is said to oppose waiver of power to
                            grant special favors.</p>
                        <p>Special session of Congress not yet called owing to disturbed internal
                            political conditions … These have preoccupied the attention of the
                            Cabinet so that treaty could not have been presented advantageously last
                            week even if that were your desire. Moreover rumors of Cabinet
                            organization would have made such a move useless. It is now thought
                            Congress may convene middle of November.</p>

                            submission to the Foreign Office for negotiation between the United
                            States and Chile a draft of a treaty of Friendship, Commerce and
                            Consular Rights which already has been the subject of preliminary
                            instructions. A copy of the draft is enclosed for the use of the
                                Embassy.<note n="13" xml:id="d381fn13">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Detailed instructions in regard to each article of the draft will be sent
                            to you by an early pouch. The following statements in explanation of the
                            more important differences between the enclosed draft and the Treaty of
                            Friendship, Commerce and Consular Rights signed by the United States and
                            Germany, December 8, 1923, are made for your information and for use in
                            explanations to the Chilean authorities.</p>
                        <p>The reservation concerning statutes relating to the immigration of aliens
                            made by the Senate of the United States in giving its advice and consent
                            to the ratification of the treaty between the United States and Germany
                            is incorporated in the draft as the last paragraph of Article I. The
                            reservation making provision for the termination at the end of one year
                            of the paragraphs of Article VII relating to the treatment of vessels
                            and Articles IX and XI (Articles X and XII of the enclosed draft) is not
                            included in the enclosed draft. Further reference will be made to this
                            reservation.</p>
                        <p>The fourth paragraph of Article VII is designed to assure equality of
                            treatment in respect of licenses, quotas and contingents for the
                            importation or exportation of restricted goods. In practice it has been
                            difficult to obtain such equality of treatment for the commerce of the
                            United States in certain European countries in which systems prohibiting
                            or restricting the importation or exportation of certain goods have been
                            in force, and from which prohibitions or restrictions abatements are
                            made by contingents or licenses. <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0611"
                            />This Government desires that the paragraph be included in the treaty
                            with Chile as it is undertaking to have it included in all the treaties
                            of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights, which it is now
                            negotiating.</p>

                            Germany is included in a number of the older treaties to which the
                            United States is a party, and this Government desires to have it
                            included in the treaties of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular rights,
                            which it shall sign hereafter with maritime countries.</p>

                            deemed to relate to the provisions of the laws, National, State, or
                            Provincial, under which the foreign corporation or association desiring
                            to exercise such rights is organized” is designed for use in treaties
                            with countries in which the right of a corporation organized under the
                            laws of the United States to engage in business is conditioned on
                            reciprocity. This provision would have the effect of obtaining for
                            American corporations in Chile in the event that the laws of Chile in
                            relation to the right of a foreign corporation to engage in business
                            contain a condition of reciprocity, the right to engage in business
                            according to whether the laws of the State of the United States under
                            which such corporation is organized extend the right to engage in
                            business to foreign corporations.</p>

                            promoting merchant marine is considering the recommendation of

                        <p>Manager of Grace Line to make protests before Chilean Government
                            especially with regard to points 1 and 2.</p>
                        <p>Manager of Grace Line asks me to aid and says proposed measures would be
                            decisively detrimental to Grace Line and appears to be especially
                            directed against its service between Chile and New York, inasmuch as
                            there are no established Chilean lines between Chile and European
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>I request instructions and respectfully suggest that in view of strong
                            movement for promoting national objects mere representations as to
                            general desirability that nothing at all be done to hurt mutual
                            commercial interests will not be sufficient. [Paraphrase.] If we are to
                            secure moderation of Chile’s present mood, I think more concrete
                            representations will be necessary, such as would be used between
                            business competitors. I do not mean, however, to recommend—and not at
                            all under present conditions—anything suggestive of retaliation,
                            although I have a feeling that a firm policy of defense by the United
                            States is necessary. I shall take no action until I receive
                            instructions. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>37. Embassy’s telegrams: No. 109, August 22, 11 a.m.; No. 111, August 25,
                            4 p.m.; No. 115, August 30, 3 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. It is the feeling of the Department that objection may properly be
                            raised by the Government of the United States with respect to point 3 in
                            Embassy’s synopsis of proposed law and also with respect to preferential
                            export duties or bounties of similar effect should measures such as
                            those contemplated in point 2 be brought up again.</p>
                        <p>You should try in every proper way to dissuade the Government of Chile
                            from applying the above discriminatory measures, pointing out that
                            Chilean ships and their cargoes pay the same duties and charges in
                            American ports as American ships and their cargoes, and that the failure
                            of Chile to accord reciprocal treatment to American ships would be
                            viewed by the Government of the United States with the greatest regret.
                            You may say also the policy of national treatment of shipping has become
                            almost universal and that according to available information only two
                            nations at the present time depart therefrom. Almost invariably such
                            discriminatory policies lead to controversies with other states.</p>
                        <p>2. The following is for your information and guidance. The two nations to
                            which reference is made above are Mexico and Portugal. In the case of
                            the latter, representatives of maritime nations have made strong
                                representations.<note n="14" xml:id="d385fn14">Correspondence not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>3. As to point 1, while the Government of the United States does not
                            question the legal right of nations to subsidize shipping, yet it must
                            point out that the granting of subsidies to ships using the Panama <pb
                                n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0615"/>Canal, with the avowed object
                            of relieving such ships of the burden of tolls which competing ships are
                            obliged to pay, would change the present status whereby the Canal is
                            used by vessels of all countries on an equal footing. The Government of
                            the United States would view with concern any step which would tend to
                            substitute for the present regime of equality in the use of the Canal
                            one of special advantage. You may discuss this matter in the above sense
                            with the appropriate authorities. If these authorities should refer to
                            mail payments to the Grace Line by the Government of the United States,
                            you may indicate that these payments have no relation to Canal tolls and
                            that similar payments are made by the Government of the United States to
                            lines operating in other parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>For your information. The Department understands that payments to the
                            Grace Line for carrying United States mail to the west coast of South
                            America during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1927, amounted to
                            $284,801, and to the Chilean Line, the Compañía Sud Americana de
                            Vapores, whose ships it is proposed to subsidize, $50,883. The Grace
                            Line employs four ships and has approximately two sailings a month,
                            while the Chilean Line employs two ships and has one sailing a month.
                            Possibly it was the disparity in such payments which prompted the
                            recommendation of a subsidy to the Chilean Line. It may be useful in
                            this connection to ascertain the payments by the Chilean Government to
                            the two companies for carrying the mail.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of its present information regarding point 4 the Department
                            perceives no grounds for objection.</p>
                        <p>It is the desire of the Department to conclude a general commercial
                            treaty with Chile containing provisions for reciprocal national
                            treatment of shipping. On August 19 instructions were mailed to
                                you.<note n="15" xml:id="d385fn15"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref

                            diligence to prevent the adoption of a policy so gravely at variance
                            with United States treaty aims.</p>
                        <p>Inform Department fully of any action by you. In case you discuss the
                            question with your colleagues, you should be careful to avoid any
                            suggestion of joint action. You should not threaten retaliation in any
                            discussions with Chilean officials.</p>

                        <p>120. James Heavey, Chilean manager Grace Line, called today. Believes
                            nationalistic movement in Chile will result in passage of ship subsidy
                            law substantially as reported. Says there will be probably many
                            purchases of new boats. Braun and Blanchard, owners of existing service
                            between Valparaiso, Punta Arenas and Buenos Aires, already have plans
                            ask Government for guarantee of loan for purchase of at least four new
                            ships for European and North American trade. He also said Government
                            member of nitrate board contemplates immediately putting into effect
                            section 17 of nitrate law authorizing additional [subsidies?] to Chilean
                            ships that carry nitrate. Moreover all shipping interests are greatly
                            agitated by provision in the report of joint committee appointed to
                            study revision of tariff which authorizes President to grant additional
                            reduction of duty equal to 25 pesos per ton on several classes of
                            merchandise including structural steel, vehicles, agricultural machinery
                            and many other articles. Heavey estimates this represents at least 70
                            percent of American exports to Chile. Foreigners, especially British,
                            greatly agitated by this provision claiming that inasmuch as existing
                            Chilean lines to foreign countries only touch American ports this will
                            give great advantage to American exporters. Undoubtedly this proposed
                            tariff provision as well as all features of shipping law would stimulate
                            American export trade at least until Chile purchases new ships and
                            establishes services to Europe. This provision should be carefully
                            considered by the Department but I assume that you wish your
                            instructions in your cipher telegram 37, August 31, 6 p.m., complied
                            with and I will do so unless otherwise instructed.</p>

                        <p>41. Department’s telegram No. 37, August 31, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Department has noted the considerations set forth in your
                            telegram No. 120, September 2, 5 p.m., but, nevertheless, it desires
                            that every effort be made to dissuade the Government of Chile from
                            applying discriminatory import duties in favor of Chilean ships.</p>
                        <p>(2) Your telegrams No. 118, September 1, 3 p.m., and No. 120, September
                            2, 5 p.m. Bounties contemplated under section 17 of the nitrate law if
                            paid to shippers would apparently be similar in effect to preferential
                            import duties. You should, therefore, try to dissuade the Government of
                            Chile from applying the former measure on the same general grounds as
                            the latter, namely, that neither Chilean ships nor their cargoes are
                            subjected to discriminatory treatment in ports of the United States as
                            compared with American ships.</p>
                        <p>Grace and Company has informed the Department that the National Nitrate
                            Council has passed a measure, to become effective upon the approval of
                            the President, providing for a payment of 7 pesos per metric ton in
                            favor of Chilean ships for nitrate carried to Canada, Cuba, and the
                            United States. Grace and Company consider that this measure, in
                            conjunction with preferential import duties, will seriously affect their
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Inform the Department whether the payments referred to by the Grace Line
                            would be made to shippers or to shipowners. The Department is giving
                            consideration to the question whether representations should be made
                            regarding payments to Chilean shipowners based on quantity of cargo
                            carried and distance transported, but you should take no action with
                            regard to such measures without specific instructions.</p>
                        <p>(3) Your telegram No. 119, September l.<note n="16" xml:id="d388fn16"><hi

                                537</ref>.</note> It is not entirely clear to the Department whether
                            the mileage subsidy of 2 pesos per ton of coal transported in Chilean

                            to shipowners. If payable to shippers, its effect would be similar to

                        <p>133. My telegram number 118, September 1, 4 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>]
                            p.m. President of Chile yesterday issued decree under sections 17 and 33
                            of nitrate law granting to Chilean ships carrying nitrate to foreign
                            countries the following bounties per metric quintal: To countries
                            [south?] of the Panama Canal, 50 Chilean centavos; to countries north of
                            Panama Canal, including Cuba and the Antilles, 70 Chilean centavos; to
                            countries on Atlantic seaboard, 1 Chilean centavo. Decree goes into
                            effect as soon as published in <hi rend="italic">Diario Oficial</hi>.
                            Bounty is paid to ship and not to producer. Correct the error in point 2
                            of my telegram 111, of August 25, 4 p.m., and my 118, of September 1, 3
                            p.m. Error was due to incorrect newspaper report of law.</p>

                        <p>136. Your 41, September 14, 2 p.m. Supplementing my 133, September 17, 11
                            a.m. Yesterday I had separate conversations with regard to ship
                            subsidies with the President of the Republic, Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs, Under Secretary, Chief of Diplomatic Section, prominent
                            Senator, prominent Deputy on committee to which bill has been referred,
                            German and French Ministers, Dutch and British Charges. First four
                            apparently much impressed by my representations; diplomats mentioned
                            have also made representations. Principal British opposition is due to
                            their belief that preferential duties will favor American export trade.
                            However, owing to bad effects of proposed bill on British service
                            between Valparaiso and New York, they have same reasons for opposition
                            to bill as Grace Line. I am informed from other sources that British
                            Foreign Office called Chilean Minister to Great Britain to its office
                            and made very strong representations to him. Possibly such action by you
                            with Davilá<note n="17" xml:id="d390fn17">Chilean Ambassador at
                                Washington, Oct. 6, 1927.</note> would be helpful especially if
                            there is a possibility of increase of duties by us to counteract effect
                            of Chilean discrimination and bounties. I believe all persons connected
                            with the Foreign Office <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0619"/>believe
                            bill as drafted most unwise. Under Secretary says he took my note<note

                            against repayment Panama Canal dues and tariff preference and bounties
                            to Minister of Finance who has promised him to reconsider bill. He made
                            same promise to me when I saw him at suggestion of President of
                            Republic. I am soon to have another long talk with him. I also talked
                            with Delcourt, head of the Nitrate Bureau, and Simon, head of the Budget
                            Bureau, both of them members of commission that recommended ship subsidy
                            bill. Senator and Deputy with whom I talked believe bill as drafted very
                            faulty … I feel confident before final passage provisions as to Canal
                            tolls will be stricken out and there is strong probability that
                            preferential duties will be eliminated and possibly bounties to ships
                            and that instead there will be a lump sum subvention with provisions for
                            diminution in case companies do not drum up commerce and get full
                            cargoes. If section 317 of customs law<note n="19" xml:id="d390fn19">42
                                Stat. 944.</note> is applicable, may be well for Department to let
                            Dávila know of its existence even if inexpedient to intimate that it
                            will be put into effect. I shall not relax my efforts although I have
                            repeatedly urged reciprocity of treatment and have not hinted at
                            reprisals even to counteract unfair discrimination.</p>

                            to proposed law favoring mercantile marine, calling attention to
                            principles of Geneva convention 1923<note n="20" xml:id="d391fn20"

                            stating that even if Chile has not ratified it, it should not be
                            forgotten as expression of its delegate as to principles that should
                            govern, and that the United States in fact adopts this liberal practice

                        <p>Minister of Hacienda lunched with me today privately. I discussed matter
                            fully with him and I am assured by him that he will give personal
                            reconsideration to bill and redraft it and that provision <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0620"/>as to the Panama Canal toll dues will
                            be stricken out. I also believe preferential duties will be eliminated
                            and possibly also in near future payment to ships of peso per ton of
                            nitrate carried by them. He made following interesting statement
                            “Although this payment is made to ships it is intended to benefit
                            producers who unquestionably will decline to send nitrate on Chilean
                            ships unless freight is reduced by this amount paid to ships by the
                            Government.” Practically, this payment therefore is considered by him as
                            bounty to producers. I believe Government eventually will substitute law
                            granting lump sum subvention or payments for maintenance service on
                            designated routes.</p>

                        <p>62. Department’s telegram No. 61, dated November 19, 1 p.m.<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d394fn25">Not printed.</note> In regard to any proposed
                            tariff or shipping legislation by which discriminating import duties
                            would be imposed in favor of cargo carried in Chilean ships, you are
                            instructed, unless you see some objection, to invite the attention of
                            the appropriate authorities to the following laws of this country.</p>
                        <p>1. Subject to the stipulations contained in section 4228 of the Revised
                            Statutes, mentioned below, section 2502 (as amended) provides that a
                            discriminating duty of 10 percent shall be imposed on merchandise
                            imported into the United States in foreign ships. However, the
                            President, by section 4228, is empowered to suspend the application of
                            this measure in favor of ships of any nation which presents satisfactory
                            evidence that it does not lay discriminating duties on the cargoes of
                            American ships. In accordance with this stipulation a Presidential
                            proclamation dated November 1, 1850,<note n="26" xml:id="d394fn26">9
                                Stat. 1004.</note> suspended the application of such discriminating
                            duties insofar as Chilean ships were concerned, the suspension to
                            continue effective as long as reciprocal exemption of American ships
                            from discriminatory treatment was continued by Chile.</p>
                        <p>When referring to the above stipulations of law, you should indicate that
                            the adoption by the Chilean Government of the discriminatory measure in
                            question would eliminate the only basis on which the President of the
                            United States is empowered to continue in suspension the law by which
                            Chilean ships would be subjected to similar discriminatory treatment in
                            American ports.</p>
                        <p>2. If any proposal for discriminatory tonnage or other similar dues on
                            American ships be made, you should, unless you see some objection,
                            inform the Chilean authorities that American laws providing for
                            discriminatory tonnage dues have also been suspended as far as Chilean
                            ships are concerned, but that the President of the United States is
                            empowered to hold these laws in suspension only so long as American
                            ships receive national treatment with regard to such dues and charges in
                            Chilean ports.</p>
                        <p>3. You should indicate that the intent of the laws to which reference is
                            made is that the ships of each foreign government shall enjoy in
                            American ports the identical privileges which the same class of American
                            ships and cargo may enjoy in the said foreign country.</p>

                        <p>The Chilean Ambassador called on me today in relation to the laws pending
                            before the Chilean Congress. He said the Chilean Government was going to
                            abandon the discriminatory tariff duties and any law to refund canal
                            tolls and that if they did anything, they would make a straight subsidy
                            to Chilean steamship lines. I told him of course we had no objection to
                            that; that my objection to the other procedure was that we gave uniform
                            rates through the Canal to all nations; that at one time we had a law
                            giving American coastwise ships free tolls; that I had no idea that
                            Congress would ever go back to the free toll system but if foreign
                            countries commenced to refund their tolls, quite likely the Congress
                            would discriminate in favor of American ships.</p>
                        <p>So far as the tariff duties are concerned, I told him we are in favor of
                            even tariffs to all nations on all goods, whether carried in domestic or
                            foreign bottoms, but if any countries commenced to discriminate on goods
                            carried in foreign bottoms, we automatically would be compelled to do
                            the same. He said he had perhaps gone farther with his Government than
                            he ought and that he had told them he thought it was very unwise after
                            having taken the matter up with American interests. I thanked him very
                            much and told him I thought it was satisfactory as to the progressive
                            tariff on oil. He said he thought he had arranged it satisfactorily to
                            the American business interests and copper and nitrate companies. He
                            said that the House of Representatives had passed a law; that the Senate
                            was going to postpone it. He said it was largely on his advice; that the
                            cost of manufacturing copper in this country had been constantly going
                            down and the cost in Chile had been going up so that they were about
                            equal and he thought if additional burdens were placed upon the copper
                            companies, the companies would develop more copper in this country and
                            less in Chile.</p>

                        <p>50. Your despatch 1166, September 1st.<note n="29" xml:id="d397fn29">Not
                                printed; see Ambassador’s telegram No. 119, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >supra.</hi></note> The Department has received a protest from
                            the Chile Copper Company and the Andes Copper Mining Company on the
                            ground that the proposed coal law singles out American copper companies
                            for discriminatory taxation which in application will soon amount
                            practically to confiscation of their properties. The Department is not
                            yet convinced that a formal protest would be justified but you may
                            nevertheless bring the matter informally to the attention of the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs pointing out that since it appears
                            impracticable for the copper companies to use coal instead of oil the
                            proposed progressive duty upon the latter will apparently prevent them
                            from operating at a fair profit and that the exemption of Diesel engine
                            oil suggested by the Chilean Ambassador will not help matters unless
                            extended to include fuel oil. Please impress upon the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs that while the Department does not question the right of
                            the Chilean Government to enact legislation for the legitimate
                            encouragement of Chilean industries it is greatly concerned over the
                            probable effects of this particular measure and cannot believe that any
                            law which might threaten the existence of the American copper interests
                            in Chile could ultimately benefit that country.</p>

                        <p>168. Your 58, November 1, 7 p.m. It is true Chilean Government shows
                            unwillingness to modify coal and petroleum bill. Minister of Hacienda
                            last Sunday published full page exposition in local newspapers,
                            criticising American companies for not having made representations as to
                            innumerable and varied propositions and suggestions criticising methods
                            for protecting the coal industry advanced during the last 5 years. His
                            exposition also sought to justify Government’s action and challenges
                            statements made by local representatives of North American interests as
                            to burden which proposed new law will impose upon them. I immediately
                            addressed a note to Foreign Office defending companies for not having
                            bothered Government with representations as to proposals that had not
                            received Government’s approbation and referring to Minister of
                            Hacienda’s admission that Government’s proposition was not published
                            until September 2nd, and that companies’ representations were made
                            September 29th, and the American Government’s representations, based
                            upon necessarily partial and incomplete information, were made October
                            14th. I requested, in view of the immensity of interests involved, that
                            the matter be studied further by Chilean Government <pb n="540"
                                xml:id="pg_540" facs="0626"/>and opportunity be given American
                            Government to become more fully apprised as to the facts.</p>
                        <p>I have engagements to see Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of
                            the Republic as to matter today. Minister of War and Minister of Fomento
                            are dining with me tonight. Last-mentioned should be particularly
                            interested. I will endeavor to present the matter to all of them and
                            also will see Minister of Hacienda if possible.</p>
                        <p>Rampant protectionist sentiment and desperate condition of Chile coal
                            industry, coupled with [paraphrase] the reported statement that powerful
                            Chilean nitrate companies are willing to accept an increased duty on
                            coal which they use provided that the Chilean Government will reduce the
                            export duty on nitrate [end paraphrase], make it doubtful whether duties
                            will be materially reduced; but I will do the best I can. Incidentally
                            it should be borne in mind that loss of revenue caused by any possible
                            reduction of nitrate export duties will be made up by increased taxes,
                            probably on copper and possibly on iron ore.</p>

                            companies had delayed unduly in making protests and also challenged

                            if he believed such action consistent with national interest.” I

                                <p>“Minister Finance has published his intentions to nationalize
                                    insurance as soon as possible. Principal points are as follows.
                                    Government will form a reinsurance company. Foreign companies
                                    will be eliminated. Native companies must reinsure their
                                    surplusses with Government company. When law is passed companies
                                    will be considered national only if two-thirds of capital
                                    belongs to Chileans.”</p>

                        <p>64. Your No. 19, May 5, 10 a.m. Just prior to its receipt I had made
                            informal representations to Minister of Foreign Affairs as to proposed
                            insurance law, and have subsequently conversed with him. He says my
                            representations will receive serious consideration but have been sent by
                            him to the Minister of the Treasury whose project this is. Its
                            provisions are correctly stated in your cable. As yet it cannot be said
                            to have had indorsement of Cabinet although probably reflecting the
                            avowed policy of this administration to promote national interests in
                            every way possible. German and British Ministers who have made rather
                            vigorous protest owing to their large interests, believe project will be
                            adopted and this is not unlikely, although not apt to occur at once, and
                            some substantial amendment may be made. Ministers of Treasury, Interior
                            and Public Works dined with me last night. The first-named told me the
                            matter was not ready for immediate enactment, although he felt that much
                            if not all insurance should be effected in Chilean companies and that
                            French companies had been driving them out of the field by rather unfair
                            methods. I pointed out mutual advantages that would permit French
                            companies to continue business and unfairness, practically amounting to
                            that which might be considered destruction of property rights, if French
                            companies were prohibited from carrying [on] a business which they had
                            established in the past at considerable expense. Except in this respect
                            I do not see anything confiscatory. Chilean Government appears inclined
                            to consider this as simply withdrawal of a license to each business
                            issued without any consideration entitling it to be considered permanent
                            and does not consider it confiscatory. Am acting independently of
                            British and German Ministers but in close touch with them. Minister of
                            Hacienda in submitting his project to commission appointed to consider
                            insurance question said that it was not official and should be
                            considered only as basis for study. I know of no inquiries as to their
                            business yet made from foreign companies but if law is enacted new
                            companies will be subject to inspection by Superintendent of Insurance
                            and required to furnish all pertinent information that may be desired by
                            him.</p>

                        <p>97. My telegram number 64, May 13, 5 p.m. and despatches 1079, May 21st,
                            and 1135, July 16th en route,<note n="32" xml:id="d405fn32">Despatches
                                not printed.</note> with enclosures to the last. I report that
                            insurance bill, modified and made more drastic, was sent recently to
                            Congress with urgent message requesting immediate passage in form
                            presented. This draft of law limits insurance business in future to
                            nationally organized companies and requires that all reinsurance be
                            effected through the <hi rend="italic">caja</hi> of reinsurance.
                            However, it permits foreign companies now doing [business?] in Chile to
                            reorganize as national companies. Minister of Hacienda tells me that the
                            general provision that two-thirds of stock must be owned by citizens or
                            residents of Chile does not apply to last-mentioned case and that
                            existing foreign companies may reorganize and stock may be held by
                            foreigners in the same proportions as at present. Agents for American
                            companies dread requirement of reorganization as national companies
                            because of great powers given to Superintendent of Insurance who may not
                            only fix rates but determine amount of risk that may be carried and
                            dictate with what company reinsurance may be effective. Nevertheless
                            agents of American companies believe that the grant of such powers to
                            Superintendent of Insurance, although apt to be exercised capriciously
                            for the purpose [of] driving foreign insurance out of business, cannot
                            be questioned in principle as violative of international or
                            constitutional right. Proposed legislation does not appear confiscatory
                            unless refusal to allow continuance of a business which has acquired a
                            goodwill value can be so considered.</p>
                        <p>In order to prevent insurance from being written by foreign owners of
                            property located in Chile in foreign companies, the act as now drafted
                            in section 59 imposes tax on such policies equal to half of premium that
                            would be charged by Chilean national companies and imposes very heavy
                            fines in addition to [<hi rend="italic">for?</hi>] failure to pay. Prior
                            to incorporation of this provision in the bill, the big American
                            business interests had expected to avoid hardships of the law by
                            insuring in New York with New York companies and the foreign insurance
                            doing business in Chile had hoped this possibility of the insurance
                            business being thus diverted from Chile to foreign countries would
                            convince the framers of the bill of the inexpediency of the proposed
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>All are greatly perturbed by new provision and wish assistance of our
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0630"/>
                        <p>I have had three opportunities to discuss matter directly with Minister
                            of Hacienda who earnestly advocates this legislation. I got him to
                            withdraw the request for urgent action by Congress but matter has been
                            referred to a joint committee of House and Senate and it is possible
                            that measure will be rushed through notwithstanding he assured me his
                            purpose in withdrawing urgency request was to permit me to communicate
                            with you and obtain instruction.</p>
                        <p>There have been intimations that article 59 would be stricken out if we
                            would not oppose rest of legislation. Best-informed agent for American
                            companies believes this will be the maximum which we can accomplish and
                            that if this section is eliminated it will result in either abandonment
                            of the bill or eventual repeal.</p>
                        <p>I know of no treaty obligations preventing Chile from limiting insurance
                            business to its own citizens. I request Department’s instructions as to
                            any principles of international Jaw that may be invoked. I have made
                            representations to Ministry of Foreign Affairs that proposed law is
                            injurious to mutual commercial interests, inconsistent with fundamental
                            idea of insurance to spread loss and that it is particularly hazardous
                            to Chile to seek to insure itself, considering possibility of
                            catastrophe by earthquake with enormous incidental loss.</p>
                        <p>I have told Minister of Hacienda that in my opinion section 59 infringes
                            upon sovereignty foreign countries and trespasses upon right of
                            foreigners to make legitimate contracts in foreign countries with other
                            foreigners. I believe he is impressed by this reasoning and that it is
                            for this reason there have been intimations that he may change this
                            provision especially if optional provisions were withdrawn. But I have
                            specifically declared that I have no authority to compromise in this
                            manner and that I await your instructions. British, French and German
                            colleagues, who have been cooperating, are much pleased with my success

                            said that some national insurance companies fear workings of law but

                        <p>31. The Department has not yet received proposed Chilean law
                            nationalizing insurance. However, upon the information at hand, the
                            Department does not think a protest is warranted upon grounds that the
                            law under international law would be confiscatory and violative of the
                            rights of American citizens. Nor does the Department think that article
                            59 infringes upon the sovereignty of foreign countries and trespasses
                            upon the rights of foreigners as you suggest. However, the Department
                            believes that you are warranted in urging that it be eliminated because
                            it would interfere with free and mutually beneficial intercourse between
                            the United States and Chile. At your discretion you may take up this
                            matter again informally with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

                                1927, 11 a.m.; not printed.</note> Joint committee has reported
                            insurance bill with amendments to Chamber of Deputies. All efforts by
                            myself and commercial attaché and interested American enterprises to get
                            printed or specific information about committee amendments have so far
                            been unavailing, report “not yet having been printed for distribution”.
                            It is understood that existing foreign agencies will be allowed to

                            national companies upon condition that in addition to amount required
                            for mathematical reserves they invest 2,000,000 <pb n="546"

                            that can be readily liquidated and that they pay a tax on premiums
                            collected 50 percent greater than the tax to be paid by national
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>Former section 59, modified and now made section 46, is said to provide
                            that every person or company who insures property located in Chile in
                            companies not established in Chile must pay a tax “variable between 15
                            and 20 percent of the premium that would be collected by a Chilean
                            national company”, the President of the Republic to be authorized to fix
                            the tax within these limits. It is uncertain whether policies taken out
                            in foreign companies whose existing agencies may be continued by them
                            under the new law will be subject to this tax.</p>
                        <p>Shall I protest against discriminatory taxation and also against
                            second-mentioned tax so far as it affects policies on Chilean property
                            taken out in the United States by Americans not residents of Chile?
                            Cable promptly, measure likely to be rushed through. Nationalistic
                            sentiment strong, mere representations as to promotion of mutual
                            interests by equal or liberal treatment not apt to produce results.</p>

                            American fire companies already having agencies here as likely to result
                            in big increase in business because it will prevent entrance of new
                            foreign companies unless they nationalize and because it requires
                            Chilean companies to effectuate all insurance among themselves or
                            through Government <hi rend="italic">caja</hi> while requiring foreign
                            companies to reinsure in <hi rend="italic">caja</hi> only 20 percent.
                            However many object even to this in principle, unwilling to cooperate in
                            any way with Government in <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0633"

                            but most agents believe prospects of increased business will cause them
                            not to do so. Requirement of increased deposits and heavier taxes even
                            though discriminatory are not considered by agents as offsetting
                            probable big increase in business and profits. National companies in
                            whose interests bill was drafted not now completely satisfied with its
                            provisions and may seek amendments which may possibly be adopted
                            although this is not likely, moreover any further discussion is apt to
                            help established foreign companies.</p>

                        <p>138. Regular session of Congress has terminated. Government contemplates
                            calling special session about October 6th. Insurance bill will then come
                            before Senate. I request Department’s consideration of the fact that the
                            tax on policies negotiated by foreigners with foreign companies and
                            executed in foreign countries affects not only insurance on real estate,
                            that is, buildings, but also insurance on personal property, machinery
                            and other chattels and also insurance against loss of prospective
                            profits caused by interruption of business due to fire. Am informed that
                            one of three great American copper companies carries 12 million dollars
                            against loss of prospective profits, presumably the others carry
                            proportionate insurance. Attorneys for American interests have argued
                            that if such contracts relating to personal property even though used in
                            connection with or derived from real estate situated in Chile can thus
                            be taxed, it would appear that any contract affecting such personal
                            property, as for instance mortgages and assignments, could be taxed.
                            Does this in the Department’s opinion affect its decision that no
                            representation should be made against this feature of the law?</p>

                            passed Senate yesterday with modifications, all of which according to
                            Beausire, representative of Great American and Home Insurance Companies,
                            are acceptable to foreign companies. Article 46 amended so as to permit
                            insurance of properties in Chile with local branches of foreign
                            insurance companies or if the risk is unacceptable the local companies
                            may place insurance abroad without being subject to tax.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Embassy’s telegram No.
                            179 of November 17, 5 p.m., reporting the modifications made in Article
                            46 of the redrafted Insurance Bill, I have the honor to state that on
                            the 23 instant the Chamber of Deputies approved the bill in question
                            with all of the modifications made by the Senate with the exception of
                            Article 36 which does not vitally affect foreign interests but refers to
                            the question of non-taxation of local institutions of a benevolent or
                            charitable character.</p>
                        <p>The bill as presented at the opening of the special session of Congress
                            contained several new changes beneficial to Foreign Companies and the
                            subsequent amendments,—particularly in Article 46 which now allows local
                            branches of foreign insurance companies to place insurance abroad when
                            the insurance has been turned down by the local companies, without being
                            subject to a special tax,—is considered by Mr. Beausire as eliminating
                            the most harmful feature of the bill as far as foreign companies are
                            concerned. However, the cutting down of the required capitalization of
                            the local companies to only $500,000 and of the foreign companies to
                            $1,000,000 is somewhat regretted by foreign interests as this it is
                            believed will permit <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0635"/>the
                            establishment of certain local companies which would not have been able
                            to have entered the field if the original amount of $1,000,000
                            capitalization for local companies and $2,000,000 for foreign companies
                            had remained in force.</p>
                        <p>In conformity with the Department’s instructions I have refrained from
                            formal protests, but I have repeatedly made informal representations as
                            to the injury to the general business interests of the two countries
                            likely to result from the bill as originally drafted.</p>

                            of the Embassy’s General Conditions Report No. 930–G of October 6,
                                1926,<note n="34" xml:id="d414fn34">Not printed.</note> I have the
                            honor to transmit herewith a translation of the full text of the
                            decision of the Santiago Court of Appeals which held that a Second
                            Secretary of the Brazilian Embassy in Santiago—and therefore by
                            inference any other diplomatic secretary in this capital—is subject to
                            the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts in a criminal case, and that an
                            order for his arrest and imprisonment may be issued provided
                            notification thereof be given to the Brazilian Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>As the diplomatic secretary in question was recalled by his Government
                            shortly after the case began and although the decision of the Court of
                            Appeals will consequently remain without effect as regards his person,
                            most members of the diplomatic corps in Santiago feel very strongly that
                            a dangerous precedent has been set which should not remain
                            unchallenged.</p>
                        <p>For the Department’s information I am quoting below in translation
                            Article I of the Chilean Code of Criminal Procedure: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Tribunals of the Republic exercise jurisdiction over
                                    Chileans and foreigners for the purpose of judging crimes
                                    committed in its territory, except in the cases provided for by
                                    the rules generally recognized in International Law”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Department will observe, moreover, that in paragraph (1) of the
                            inclosed decision the exceptions made by International Law are admitted.
                            But in paragraph (2) the Court is of the opinion that International Law
                            recognizes diplomatic exemptions from criminal <pb n="550"
                                xml:id="pg_550" facs="0636"/>jurisdiction only in favor of
                            “Ambassadors, Ministers, and Chargés d’Affaires”.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the fact that in most civilized countries no distinction is
                            made between the chiefs of missions and the diplomatic secretaries as
                            regards their immunity from arrest and trial by the local authorities,
                            the decision appears to contradict itself because it will be noted that
                            in paragraph (9) it goes so far as to say that not even an Ambassador
                            could claim the privilege of exterritoriality if he committed a crime in
                            Chile, as he would be subject to the jurisdiction of the special
                            tribunal provided for in Article 15 of the Code of Criminal
                            Procedure.</p>

                            <head><hi rend="italic">Decision of the Santiago Court of Appeals,
                                    September 24, 1926</hi></head>
                            <p>1. As a general rule all persons who reside within the limits of a
                                country, be they citizens or foreigners, are subject to the laws
                                which that country establishes, except the exceptions recognized by
                                international law, and in consequence it pertains to the tribunals
                                of each nation to judge of all the acts subjected to them by its
                                constitution or laws and to conserve the validity of the public
                                authority by the defence and vindication of all the rights created
                                by its laws which have been disregarded.</p>
                            <p>2. That the exceptions recognized by international law, accepted by
                                all civilized countries, are (1) the person of a sovereign, when he
                                enters the territory of a friendly power; (2) the diplomatic agents,
                                understanding as such the ambassadors and diplomatic ministers and
                                chargés d’Affaires, who represent the sovereign and government of
                                friendly nations; (3) the warships which sail or anchor in
                                territorial waters; (4) the armies or troops of other nations which
                                visit or pass in transit through national territory;</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>9. That if the Secretary Barroso were not subjected to the Chilean
                                Tribunals for the purpose of judging the criminal acts which he may
                                have committed, he would be in a better position than the Ambassador
                                himself, who would have to appear because of the privilege he enjoys
                                before the special tribunal established by Article 15 of the Code of
                                Penal Procedure, and who would not be protected by exterritoriality
                                for the purpose of being judged by the Brazilian courts, because it
                                would be a question of a common crime committed on Chilean
                                territory.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department refers to the Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 962 of November 22, 1926, enclosing a copy in translation
                            of the decision of the Court of Appeals at Santiago of September 24,
                            1926, holding that a Secretary of the Brazilian Embassy in Santiago was
                            subject to the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts in a criminal case and
                            that he might be arrested and imprisoned for his criminal acts committed
                            in Chilean territory. The Embassy states that although the decision of
                            the Court will remain without practical effect as the Secretary in
                            question was called home by his Government shortly after the case began,
                            members of the diplomatic corps in Santiago feel that the decision is a
                            dangerous precedent and should not go unchallenged.</p>
                        <p>While the Department feels that the decision of the Court in the case
                            referred to was in contravention of the generally recognized principle
                            of international law that diplomatic immunity from local criminal
                            jurisdiction enjoyed by heads of diplomatic missions also extends to the
                            members of their suites, it is considered that this Government need not
                            make a special protest against the precedent set by the case. However,
                            should the diplomatic corps at Santiago decide that the decision merits
                            a joint protest to the Chilean Government as being contrary to
                            international law, you are authorized to express concurrence.</p>
