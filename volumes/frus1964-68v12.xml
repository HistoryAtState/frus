                <p>April 12, 2001</p>
                <p>The documentary record of America's relations with its Western
                    European allies as presented in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the
                        United States</hi>, 1964-1968, Volume XII, Western Europe, was released
                    today by the Department of State.</p>
                <p>During this period, French President Charles <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s policies led to serious differences between
                    France and the United States, particularly over French withdrawal from the
                    military side of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and French determination
                    to build a separate nuclear force (force de frappe). Nevertheless France
                    continued its strong support of firm tripartite policy on Berlin, and the French
                    were equally shaken by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Aside from
                    the latter, much of France's preoccupation in 1968 was with the
                    student and worker riots. The United States and France had sharply differing
                    perspectives on Vietnam throughout the period.</p>
                <p>With regard to Scandinavia, the volume includes documentation on a problem that
                    arose with Denmark in January 1968, when a nuclear-armed U.S. B-52 bomber
                    crashed in Thule, Greenland, and raised the thorny issue of nuclear overflights
                    and the storage of nuclear weapons. The documentation on Italy reflects U.S.
                    interest in the internal political scene in Italy as the center-left coalition
                    took power, as well as developments within the Italian Communist Party.</p>
                <p>Spain unsuccessfully demanded support of Spanish foreign policy
                    initiatives—especially the return of Gibraltar from the
                    British—and more concessions for a renewal of U.S. base rights in
                    Spain. Portugal had to cope with low-level insurgencies in its African colonies
                    of Angola and Mozambique and was not prepared to criticize America in Vietnam.
                    The Salazar regime grew suspicious that the United States was aiding the rebels
                    in Portuguese Africa and tired of U.S. efforts to prevent Portugal from
                    obtaining military supplies. Portugal also used its defense and base agreements
                    with the United States to try to wrest concessions from Washington. During the
                    Johnson administration the Vatican had misgivings about U.S. policy in Vietnam,
                    and <persName corresp="#p_PVIGBM1">Pope Paul VI</persName> made a concerted
                    effort to mediate a Vietnam settlement. In 1967 both Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Hubert Humphrey</persName> and President Johnson met with
                    the Pope to try to win the Vatican's understanding.</p>
                <p>The United States traditionally has had a “special
                    relationship” with Britain and similarly close relationship with
                    Canada based on such factors as language, proximity, and long-standing
                    alliances. The documentation on the United Kingdom shows a more tense
                    relationship after Labor Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Harold
                        Wilson</persName> took office. Severely hurt by a balance-of-payments
                    problem, the Labor Government had to make drastic budgetary cuts, including a
                    virtual abandonment of British military commitments East of Suez. This was not
                    welcome news to the Johnson administration, which was escalating its military
                    presence in Southeast Asia. Although the United States sought to support the
                    pound, Britain suffered through a series of sterling crises. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> became critical of U.S. policy in
                    Vietnam, and personal relations between Johnson and <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> sharpened.</p>
                <p>U.S.-Canadian relations had seen the same kinds of personality clash when
                    Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and President John
                    Kennedy met. Johnson and Liberal Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Lester Pearson</persName> at least agreed to disagree politely over
                    outstanding issues, although in February 1967 Johnson expressed his displeasure
                    about Canadian criticism of his Vietnam policy. Johnson later repaired the
                    damage with <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, but it was clear to
                    officials in the Johnson administration that Canada would not necessarily follow
                    the U.S. lead in foreign policy matters, especially in issues such as
                    territorial waters and fisheries.</p>

                <p>(This is not an official statement of policy by the Department of State; it is
                    intended only as a guide to the contents of this volume.)</p>
                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State's documentary series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> has constituted
                    the official record of the foreign policy and diplomacy of the United States.
                    Historians in the Office of the Historian collect, arrange, and annotate the
                    principal documents comprising the record of American foreign policy. The
                    standards for the preparation of the series and the general deadlines for its
                    publication are established by the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the
                        United States</hi> statute of October 28, 1991 (22 USC 4351, <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.). Volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series are published when all the necessary editing,
                    declassification, and printing steps have been completed.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are drawn from the centralized indexed files of the
                    Department of State and the decentralized Bureau, Office, and other lot files of
                    the relevant Departmental units. The volume also includes records from the
                    Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the documents printed here were originally classified. The
                    Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services, Bureau
                    of Administration, Department of State, in concert with the appropriate offices
                    in other agencies or governments, carried out the declassification of the
                    selected documents.</p>
                <p>The following is a summary of the most important of the issues covered.
                    Parenthetical citations are to numbered documents in the text.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Denmark</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In late January 1968 a nuclear-armed U.S. bomber crashed in Thule, Greenland. The
                    Danish Government immediately issued a public statement stressing that there
                    could be no overflights over Greenland. (1) The Thule incident precipitated a
                    round of diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and Danish Governments over
                    provisions of the 1951 Agreement concerning the defense of Greenland. The
                    agreement contained clauses that were not explicit on the subject of
                    consultations concerning nuclear overflights and storage. (2-6) The United
                    States expressed willingness to provide confidential assurances that it would
                    use Greenland for neither nuclear storage nor overflights without consulting the
                    Danish Government. (7-8, 10) The Danish Government informed the United States
                    that it sought to supplement the 1951 Defense Agreement. (11-16) After several
                    months of diplomatic negotiations, the issue was resolved by an exchange of
                    notes on May 31, 1968, according to which the United States would not store
                    nuclear weapons in Greenland nor overfly Greenland without Danish Government
                    consent. (17-21)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">France</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Relations with France were by far the most difficult for the Johnson
                    administration. U.S.-French differences covered a spectrum that included Cuba
                    (25), Southeast Asia (26, 29), the People's Republic of China (27),
                    and, most importantly, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other European
                    issues (31). U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Charles
                        Bohlen</persName> advised firmness with the French based on insistence on
                    quid pro quo in all aspects of the relationship. (27)</p>
                <p>The United States did take a firm line with the French on the issue of its
                    nuclear weapons development program, placing export controls on materials that
                    world facilitate French development of its force de frappe. (30, 35-37, 43)
                    However, President Johnson avoided direct clashes with the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> regime. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> searched for a modus vivendi (38, 39),
                    while President Johnson was conciliatory in February 1965 talks with Foreign
                    Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>. (43) Johnson
                    would later remark that he was convinced that France would line up with the
                    United States, “when the chips were down” (52), a view
                    never fully shared by many of his advisers. (82)</p>
                <p>The foreign policy bureaucracy viewed relations with France in a more negative
                    light than Johnson. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> talked of
                    “riding out” <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>, recognizing that changing French policy was impossible as
                    long as the Fifth Republic's founder remained in power. (42) The
                    Ambassador, however, reminded his superiors that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName>'s government had adopted a gratuitously
                    anti-American line for its overall policy. (45) France's flirtation
                    with the Soviet Union was one such independent initiative. (22) Its raids on
                    U.S. gold reserves was another source of perturbation. (16)</p>
                <p>The United States wished to avoid confrontations that would jeopardize military
                    and security interests in France. (57) Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> pulled French forces out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and ordered the United States to remove its supply bases from
                    French soil. Hard bargaining followed as the United States insisted on serious
                    compensation from its ally. (54, 58, 59, 63, 64, 67)</p>
                <p>In December 1965, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was
                    re-elected. The prospect of seven more years of dealing with the French
                    President led to an internal policy debate within the U.S. Government. While
                    former Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Douglas Dillon</persName>
                    counseled patience (55), Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> urged a more confrontational approach. (56)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> intensified his anti-American
                    offensive in 1966 by directly challenging the Southeast Asian policy of the
                    Johnson administration during an August-September tour of the region. (65, 66)
                    In December 1966 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> visited Paris where
                    he sought a modus vivendi. (70) Although <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                        Gaulle</persName> was polite, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had
                    hardly departed before the General sharply condemned U.S. actions in Vietnam.
                    (71) He considered that in view of the French experience in Vietnam, it was
                    demeaning for the Americans to ignore French misgivings concerning U.S. policy
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> reasoned that while the United
                    States and the Soviet Union were roughly equivalent in military power, the
                    United States greatly exceeded the Soviet in economic and political strength. It
                    was thus by far the most powerful nation in the world, and such power would
                    eventually, and inevitably, lead to its exerting hegemony over less powerful
                    nations. It was thus incumbent upon France to increase its own power (i.e.,
                    develop its force de frappe), and to assert its independence. (72) One example
                    was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s call for an
                    independent Quebec, which upset the United States as well as infuriating Canada.
                    (76) Another was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                    effort to take advantage of what he perceived as a Soviet preoccupation with
                    China to achieve a bilateral state of détente with the Soviet Union.
                    The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 put a definitive end
                    to this hope. (83)</p>
                <p>The French President's policy was also constrained by internal crises.
                    The May 1968 student and workers' revolt seriously weakened his
                    domestic political base, and a plummeting franc forced France to rely upon the
                    U.S. leadership on international monetary matters to stabilize its economy. (82,
                    86)</p>
                <p>The French Government continued, however, openly to criticize U.S. actions that
                    it opposed. Nevertheless, it did assist the United States by hosting the
                    American negotiations with the North Vietnamese. (84, 85)</p>

                </p>
                <p>Relations with Italy remained strong. A center-left coalition of Christian
                    Democrats and Socialists, headed by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Aldo
                        Moro</persName>, took office at the outside of the Johnson administration.
                    Its perceived fragility, however, eventually led to a U.S. review of support for
                    civic action programs in Italy, which continued assistance for these programs
                    albeit at a reduced level. (92, 108, 113, 116) As time passed, the Embassy in
                    Rome continued to receive reports from some Italian officials expressing concern
                    about the government's stability and the durability of the
                    center-left government. Although he had to re-constitute his center-left
                    government twice during this period, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>
                    remained as Prime Minister until June 1968. (87, 89, 90, 95-101)</p>
                <p>Italy continued to be a strong supporter of European integration and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> throughout this period. The Italians were
                    distressed with France's withdrawal from the military side of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and were consistently sensitive to the
                    importance of Italy's role and status in the alliance. (102) The
                    Italian Government attempted to be supportive of the United States on Vietnam,
                    although there were clearly misgivings among many Italians about where the war
                    was leading. The Mayor of Florence under took a peace mission to Hanoi in 1965,
                    but came home empty-handed. (106, 115, 117, 119-121)</p>
                <p>The principal bilateral issue was in the field of civil aviation. The Italians
                    denounced the U.S.-Italian Civil Aviation Agreement in 1967 on the ground that
                    the benefits were unbalanced in favor of the United States, setting in motion
                    negotiations that continued for several years and into the Nixon administration.
                    (112, 131) Other bilateral problems concerned a possible loan to Fiat to build a
                    car plant in the Soviet Union (134, 137) and U.S. attempts to convince Italy to
                    purchase the Lockheed Orion anti-submarine aircraft (139, 140, 143, 146).</p>

                </p>
                <p>The U.S.-Portuguese relationship passed through difficult times during the
                    Johnson administration. The United States was trying to loosen the <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> regime's hold on its
                    colonial territories in Africa. (147-149, 151) The Portuguese Government
                    resisted all efforts to change its policy and became increasingly suspicious of
                    the United States. (152, 153) It engaged in a systematic program of delaying
                    defense agreements with the United States. (154, 163) <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s suspicions that the United
                    States was aiding African rebels (155, 158, 161), as well as U.S. efforts to
                    choke off illegal military supplies to Portugal (159, 172), increased the
                    tensions between the two governments.</p>
                <p>The approaching end of the <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> era
                    increasingly tempered the U.S. approach to Portugal. (171) When <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> was incapacitated in late 1968, U.S.
                    officials made overtures to the new leadership about a softening of Portuguese
                    policies. <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Marcello Caetano</persName>,
                    Portugal's new Prime Minister, made a number of small reforms, but
                    the basic Portuguese policy line remained unchanged. (172-176)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="strong">Spain</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Spain of General Franco remained another difficult ally for U.S.
                    policymakers. While Portugal's dictatorship conducted a foreign
                    policy that was essentially defensive, Spain pursued an aggressive agenda and
                    demanded U.S. support. (179, 185, 186, 193)</p>
                <p>During 1966 the Spanish Government formally linked base agreements to U.S.
                    support of its foreign policy objectives. (198) As a test of U.S. commitment,
                    Spain tried to involve the United States in efforts to oust the British from
                    Gibraltar (199, 200, 202), to support Spanish candidacy for the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> (201), and to defend its colonial territories
                    in North Africa (204). None met with success.</p>
                <p>When base negotiations reopened in November 1967, Spain presented a series of new
                    demands. (206) While the State Department favored a flexible strategy that would
                    reduce U.S. activities in Spain, the Department of Defense insisted on retention
                    of all existing bases. (209, 211) A common policy, worked out in the Senior
                    Interagency Group, was subsequently approved by President Johnson. (213, 214)
                    Negotiations, however, deadlocked over the size of Spanish offset demands.
                    (216-220) A November 1968 visit by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to Madrid failed to resolve the issue (221), and the
                    Johnson administration decided to leave the issue for the incoming Nixon
                    administration. (224)</p>
                <p>In January 1966 the crash of a U.S. nuclear-armed aircraft on Spanish soil added
                    another problem to the bilateral agenda. Spain insisted on closely controlled
                    press access and suspended U.S. overflight rights. The United States sought to
                    expand press access and urged reinstatement of its overflight rights. (189-191,
                    194-195)</p>
                <p>In other areas, the United States and Spain differed on policies toward Cuba
                    (177, 178, 180, 182, 187), and General Franco expressed reservations about U.S.
                    policy in Vietnam. In a series of messages to President Johnson, Franco
                    cautioned that U.S. policy in Southeast Asia was unworkable, although shortly
                    after the Tet offensive, he urged that the United States
                    “persevere” militarily in Vietnam. (184, 188, 204)</p>

                <p>In October 1964 <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Harold Wilson</persName> became Prime
                    Minister. The new Labour government inherited a major balance-of-payments
                    problem that forced severe budgetary cuts. (231) When the sterling crisis broke
                    in November 1964, <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> appealed to
                    Johnson for aid, which was quickly tendered. (233, 234) In December 1964 the
                    Prime Minister visited Washington to lay out his plans and warn the United
                    States that drastic military cuts would probably be part of the British budget
                    package. (236-237)</p>
                <p>This unwelcome news prompted analysis of the impact of cuts on the U.S. defense
                    posture. (239, 242, 245) British decisions to reduce its commitments
                    “East of Suez” came just as the United States was
                    escalating its involvement in Vietnam. (240)</p>
                <p>In July 1965 the British faced a second major sterling crisis. Further defense
                    cuts followed. (246, 247) Under Secretary of State Gorge Ball flew to London in
                    an effort to convince the British to hold the line on defense spending. (249)
                    The United States, meanwhile, came to the support of the weakened pound.
                    (250)</p>
                <p>In December 1965 <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> again visited
                    Washington for discussions that included both Vietnam and defense policies. The
                    British outlined their plans for more defense cuts in subsequent talks with U.S.
                    officials. (252-253). A January 1966 meeting in Washington led to a full airing
                    of problems occasioned by the British Defense Review, which called for
                    diminished worldwide commitments in light of limited financial resources. (255)
                    Further discussions followed. (256, 257)</p>
                <p>U.S. bombing attacks near Hanoi were opposed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>, with the consequence that President
                    Johnson in effect sought a “good conduct” assurance from
                    the Prime Minister as a ticket to a meeting with the President in Washington in
                    July 1966. (259-261, 266)</p>
                <p>In 1967 the United States underlined its concern that British withdrawal from
                    Singapore and Malaysia would undercut U.S. efforts in Vietnam, but in July the
                    Prime Minister informed the President of his definite decision to withdraw.
                    (268-270, 273, 274) Another major sterling crisis followed in fall 1967, and
                    again the United States intervened in support of the United Kingdom. (277-280)
                    The combined strains of the Vietnam war and the British financial crisis forced
                    the President to take emergency action to stave off a weakening of the dollar.
                    (283, 284)</p>
                <p>In 1968 British economic woes forced cancellation of major defense contracts with
                    U.S. firms. (290, 291) Despite the President's expressions of dismay
                    and concern for the consequences of the British move, the United Kingdom
                    announced an acceleration of its “East of Suez” withdrawal
                    in January 1968. (286, 288, 289) In June 1968 the U.S. National Security Council
                    reviewed U.S.-British relations in the wake of the downsizing of the United
                    Kingdom's international commitments. (296).</p>

                    <hi rend="strong">The Vatican</hi>
                </p>
                <p>During World War II and the early years of the Cold War, U.S.-Vatican relations
                    centered on a common interest in denying control of Europe to communist regimes,
                    most notably, the Soviet Union. In the early 1960s, however, the
                    Vatican's perspectives changed notably. European questions, while
                    still important, began to lose ground to other international issues, among them
                    Vietnam, Latin America, and an opening to the Communist world. (300-301) A new
                    Pope, <persName corresp="#p_PVIGBM1">Paul VI</persName> (1964-1978), sought to
                    expand the Vatican's dialogue with the United States through a 1965
                    meeting at the United Nations with President Johnson. (302-303) While the issue
                    of establishing permanent relations with the Holy See was discussed within the
                    administration, the focus of high-level discussions with the Vatican was a
                    growing divergence on U.S. policy in Vietnam. (304-305, 307, 311-313) Vice
                    President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> met with the Pope in
                    an effort to clarify that policy in April 1967 (308), and during his December
                    1967 around-the-world trip, the President made Rome a stopover in an effort to
                    win Vatican understanding. (309-310)</p>

                </p>
                <p>During this period, relations with Canada entered a somewhat less troubled era.
                    After the Kennedy-Diefenbaker clashes, the United States and Canada managed to
                    agree to disagree on a generally more polite level. The size of the U.S. role in
                    Canada's economy and society and Canadian efforts to protect its
                    separateness were constants. While recognizing Canada's right to
                    pursue an independent national existence, specific Canadian protectionist
                    measures raised objections from U.S. officials. (314, 319, 329) Major issues
                    during the Johnson years included auto parts, successfully resolved in 1965
                    (316, 318, 323, 324, 330), and Canada's territorial waters claims
                    (317, 321, 325, 332, 334-336, 339, 343), which were not.</p>
                <p>Vietnam represented a contentious issue in the two nations' bilateral
                    relationship. Canadian leaders were politely but insistently critical of U.S.
                    policy. (315, 320, 333, 345) President Johnson, sensitive to any criticism, but
                    particularly that coming from a close ally and next-door neighbor, reacted
                    angrily. In February 1965 he expressed strong displeasure to Prime Minister
                        <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> over the issue of Vietnam.
                    (327)</p>
                <p>The Embassy in Canada pressed for continuing high level contacts as the best
                    means of dealing with differences between the two states. (331) President
                    Johnson and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> met in
                    1967 to review a wide range of issues. (340) The meeting renewed their
                    relationship. However, U.S. officials fretted over what they saw as an
                    increasing Canadian tendency to reject cooperation. (342, 344)</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents

                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of

                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying
                    specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series
                    were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's
                    Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the

                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964-1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
                    volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of
                    President Johnson's administration. This volume documents U.S. policy
                    toward Denmark, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Vatican,
                    and Canada. <ref target="frus1964-68v13"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964-1968, volume XIII</ref>,

                <p>The editor of this volume sought to present documentation illuminating
                    responsibility for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>Government, with emphasis on the President and
                    his advisers. The documents include memoranda and records of discussions that
                    set forth policy issues and options and show decisions or actions taken. The
                    emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy and on major aspects and
                    repercussions of its execution rather than on the details of policy
                    execution.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>'s preoccupation
                    with Southeast Asia limited his active participation in policymaking for other
                    regions. Although interested in Western Europe as a whole, he cared most about
                    the broad contours of U.S. policy toward the continent, specifically European
                    economic and political integration, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
                        (<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>), the proposed Multilateral Force
                        (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>), and the Atlantic Nuclear Force
                        (<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>). Those topics are covered extensively
                    in <ref target="frus1964-68v13">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964-1968, volume XIII</ref>.</p>
                <p>The documentation printed in this volume highlights the central role of the
                    Department of State in bilateral policy formulation toward individual Western
                    European nations and Canada. The documentation on Denmark focuses on Danish
                    nuclear policy on Greenland and a supplementary understanding reached between
                    the United States and Denmark on their 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement in
                    the aftermath of the crash of a nuclear-armed U.S. B-52 bomber near Thule Air
                    Force Base in Greenland. Documentation on France is more comprehensive and
                    includes Franco-American differences, primarily those stemming from President
                        <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actions
                    concerning <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, as well as differences over
                    Cuba, Southeast Asia, and the People's Republic of China. The
                    documentation on Italy reflects U.S. interest in the internal political scene in
                    Italy at the outset of the center-left coalition period, as well as developments
                    in the Italian Communist Party. The documentation on Portugal highlights U.S.
                    concerns about the policies of the <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> regime in Africa. With regard to Spain, the documents
                    focus on negotiations over renewal of U.S. base rights in Spain as well as
                    Spain's thoughts about its future relationships with Western Europe
                    in general and the European Economic Community in particular. The documentation
                    on the United Kingdom is a tour d'horizon of economic, political, and
                    defense issues. The main topics include the sterling crisis, British plans to
                    pull back “East of Suez,” and Anglo-American differences
                    over Vietnam. Also included in this volume is documentation on the Vatican,
                    which reflects the Holy See's increasing concern about the conflict
                    in Vietnam and the Pope's efforts to mediate the conflict. Extensive
                    consultations on Vietnam are also highlighted in the documentation on Canada,
                    but there is also an important focus on trade, Law of the Sea, and fisheries
                    issues.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by
                    high-level policymakers, especially those that were made available to President
                    Johnson.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in
                    the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and, if so, this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>other first-hand accounts has
                    been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
                    the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
                    the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the
                    contents of individual volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall
                    process and makes recommendations on particular problems that come to its
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed this volume but has considered particular
                    declassification issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1995 and was
                    completed in 2000, resulted in the decision to withhold about .7 percent of the
                    documentation proposed for publication; 3 documents were withheld in full. A
                    determination to acknowledge two sensitive intelligence matters was made by a
                    High-Level Panel consisting of senior officials from the Department of State,
                    the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The Panel
                    arrived at a determination that resulted in the release of additional
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>notes presented here provide an accurate
                    account of U.S. policy toward Western European nations and Canada during the
                    1964-1968 period.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files
                    (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat,
                    which contain the records of international conferences and high-level official
                    visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of
                    State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of
                    State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. All the
                    Department's indexed central files for these years have been
                    permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, are in the process of being
                    transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President Johnson and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including
                    the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department
                    of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the
                    Johnson Library <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>are in the Country
                    Files and other component parts of the National Security File, such as Head of
                    State Correspondence.</p>
                <p>Equal in importance to the White House records at the Johnson Library were the
                    records of the Department of State. The Department's central files
                    contain the cable traffic recording U.S. diplomatic relations; memoranda of
                    diplomatic conversations; and memoranda proposing action or providing
                    information. Some important documents are found only in the
                    Department's lot files. The Conference Files maintained by the
                    Executive Secretariat contain briefing materials as well as records of
                    conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were not approved is often
                    found only in desk or bureau files.</p>
                <p>This volume includes a number of intelligence records. Among the intelligence
                    records reviewed for the volume were those in country and intelligence files at
                    the Johnson Library, the files of the Directors of Central Intelligence,
                    especially <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports and summaries, retired
                    files of the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research containing National Intelligence Estimates, and the INR Historical
                    Files.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides the Department of State historians
                    access to intelligence documents from records in its custody and at the
                    Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s History Staff, part of the Center
                    for the Study of Intelligence, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of these
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old,
                    except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the
                    President, should be reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                <p>The Truman administration's concern over Soviet
                    “psychological warfare” prompted the new National Security
                    Council to authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4-A of December
                    1947, the launching of peacetime covert action operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4-A made the Director of Central Intelligence
                    responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the same time the
                    principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch function. The
                    Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) certainly was
                    a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in part because the
                    Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with
                    minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="actionsstatementfn1">

                    The Department of State, believing this role too important to be left to the
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone and concerned that the military
                    might create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen
                    the issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    directive, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, superseded <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4-A.</p>
                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely
                    “psychological” operations, defining them as all
                    activities “which are conducted or sponsored by this Government
                    against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign
                    states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government
                    responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if
                    uncovered <pb n="XXXII" xml:id="pg_XXXII" facs="0032"/>the US Government can
                    plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.”</p>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including
                    sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states,
                    including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [sic] groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in
                    threatened countries of the free world. Such operations should not include armed
                    conflict by recognized military forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover
                    and deception for military operations.”<note n="2" xml:id="actionsstatementfn2">

                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on September 1, 1948, in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, assumed responsibility for organizing and
                    managing covert actions. OPC, which was to take its guidance from the Department
                    of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime, initially had direct
                    access to the State Department and to the military without having to proceed
                    through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s administrative
                    hierarchy, provided the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was informed of
                    all important projects and decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="actionsstatementfn3">Memorandum of conversation by Frank G. Wisner, “Implementation
                        of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>-10/2,” August 12, 1948,
                        printed ibid., <ref target="frus1945-50Intel#d298">Document 298</ref>.</note> In 1950 this
                    arrangement was modified to ensure that policy guidance came to OPC through the
                    DCI.</p>
                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s activities.
                    Concerned about this situation, DCI Walter Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for enhanced policy guidance and a
                    ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations. The White House responded with two
                    initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the Psychological Strategy
                    Board (PSB) under the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to coordinate
                    government-wide psychological warfare strategy. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, issued in October 1951, reaffirmed the covert action
                    mandate given in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and expanded <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s authority over guerrilla
                        warfare.<note n="4" xml:id="actionsstatementfn4">

                <p>As the Truman administration ended, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was near

                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> continued to seek and receive advice on specific projects from

                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s latitude in 1954. In accordance with a series of
                    National Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of
                    Central Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.
                    President Eisenhower approved <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5412 on March
                    15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency's
                    responsibility for conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert
                    actions was set forth; the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with
                    designated representatives of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
                    Defense to ensure that covert operations were planned and conducted in a manner
                    consistent with U.S. foreign and military policies; and the Operations
                    Coordinating Board was designated the normal channel for coordinating support
                    for covert operations among State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
                    Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance of major covert action
                    programs initiated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> under this policy
                    and were to give policy approval for such programs and secure coordination of

                        <p>On January 21, 1968, a fire broke out aboard a nuclear-armed U.S.
                            Strategic Air Command B-52 bomber, based at Plattsburgh Air Force Base
                            in New York, while it was over Greenland on a routine mission. The pilot
                            sought to make an emergency landing at Thule Air Force Base in Greenland
                            but then ordered an immediate evacuation when smoke filled the cabin and
                            electrical power went out. The pilotless aircraft crashed 7-1/2 miles
                            from Thule Base on the ice of North Star Bay. The conventional high
                            explosives in the B-52's four thermonuclear bombs went off,
                            scattering radioactive debris over the ice, but there was no nuclear
                            detonation. Six of the seven crew members survived. For more information
                            on the accident, see Scott D. Sagan, <hi rend="italic">The Limits of

                            January 22 press release announcing the crash, the Department of Defense
                            stated that the aircraft carried nuclear weapons but that they were
                            unarmed and thus there was no danger of a nuclear explosion at the crash
                            site. (Telegram 102343, January 22; National Archives and Records

                        <p>On January 22 U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Katherine White warned the
                            Department of State the “repercussions in Denmark may be
                            severe in light of special nuclear sensitivities.” (Telegram
                            2814 from Copenhagen; Johnson Library, National Security File, Country
                            File, Denmark, Vol. 1) Within hours Danish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> issued a press release stating, in
                            part: “The Danish policy regarding nuclear weapons also
                            applies to Greenland and also the air space over Greenland. There are no
                            nuclear weapons in Greenland. The American authorities are aware of
                            Denmark's nuclear policy and the Danish Govt assumes that
                            there are no American over-flights of Greenland by aircraft carrying
                            nuclear weapons.” (Telegram 2835 from Copenhagen, January 22;
                            ibid.) Two hours later Danish Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> made a similar statement, specifying that
                            “there can be no overflights over Greenland by aircraft
                            carrying nuclear weapons.” (Telegram 2838 from Copenhagen,
                            January 22; ibid.) Both statements noted, however, that in times of
                            emergency it could become necessary for an American aircraft to land in
                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>The statements by <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> expressed a view of
                            Danish nuclear policy that differed markedly from the way it was
                            understood by U.S. officials, a difference that precipitated 4 months of
                            negotiations resulting in a new agreement between the two countries.
                            This critical period <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0038"/>in relations
                            between Denmark and the United States-and the Cold War developments that
                            led up to it-later became the focus of a study commissioned by the
                            Government of Denmark. In 1995 the Danish Government asked the newly
                            established Danish Institute of International Affairs (DUPI) to produce
                            a historical review of U.S. overflights of Greenland with nuclear
                            weapons and the role of Thule Air Force Base in that connection for the
                            period from 1945 to 1968. The government also asked that the report deal
                            with the decision-making process and the general situation so far as
                            security policy and international relations were concerned.</p>
                        <p>In 1997 DUPI submitted to the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs and then
                            published a two-volume study entitled <hi rend="italic">Gronland under
                                den kolde krig: Dansk og amerikansk sikkerhedspolitik, 1945-68</hi>
                                (<hi rend="italic">Greenland During the Cold War: Danish and
                                American Security Policy, 1945-68</hi>). DUPI indicated that its
                            access to Danish Government archives had, in general, been satisfactory
                            but that its extensive research in U.S. Government archives did not
                            include privileged access. Volume 1, in Danish, contains 614 pages of
                            analysis. Volume 2 contains facsimiles of 102 documents from Danish and
                            U.S. archives. DUPI also published a 51-page <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi> consisting of an English translation of the concluding
                            chapter of volume 1.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that the statements

                            had come as a surprise to us. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> had merely re-stated Danish
                            nuclear policy. Mr. Leddy said that we did not want to go any further
                            into this question; that we saw no utility in pursuing the matter.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that Danish
                            nuclear policy covers Greenland, as the <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName>
                            statements had pointed out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied that we had not contradicted these
                            statements, but that we do not want to get into a public discussion on
                            the matter of routes; that we believe it would be most unwise to open
                            such a discussion. Therefore, we could not add to the statement
                            (attachment B)<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">Attached is the text of a
                                proposed Department of Defense press release, which was transmitted
                                to Copenhagen in telegram 103632, January 23. The press release
                                stated that news stories claiming that the B-52 was scheduled to
                                land at Thule Airfield were wrong; the B-52 was scheduled to return
                                to Plattsburgh Air Force Base after completing its mission without
                                any intervening landings elsewhere; furthermore, there were not
                                “scheduled landings of B-52's at Thule at any
                                time.”</note> a reference to overflights. Under the
                            circumstances, it would probably be just as well to have no statement at
                            all. </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> would, the following
                            day, be questioned on Danish nuclear policy. The Ambassador added that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> was familiar with
                            Denmark's policy in this area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that he felt that statement
                            could create more problems than it solved but that he would accede to
                            its release. He added that we did not want to set off another round of
                            routes discussion and that we could not go any further than the present
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that lack of
                            further U.S. comment could indicate that the U.S. does not accept
                            Denmark's foreign policy on nuclear matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> sad that it was simply that we do
                            not comment in a way that could lead people to speculate on alert flight
                            routes. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that
                            the lack of U.S. Government comment left him in a very difficult
                            situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out
                            that the Danish Government had made its policy statements; that we did
                            not challenge these statements but will not comment further on this
                            subject. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said
                            that he was very unhappy with the situation, and that he would be
                            informing his Government.</p>

                        <p>3. In making this information available to him I explained that we had
                            done so because it had appeared to us that the public statements of
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> on the questions of
                            storage and overflights seemed to us to be inconsistent with the tacit
                            understandings between the two governments; that we had realized that
                            these understandings had been closely held within the Danish Government;
                            and that in view of the delicacy of the matter we had delayed reminding
                            the Danish Government of these understandings in the hope that the
                            Danish leaders themselves would become aware of them from their own
                            sources within the Danish Government.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that he personally
                            had been completely familiar with Denmark's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> files on this subject up to 1962 (he
                            was chief of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and military affairs
                            in <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> 1957-62) and had never
                            heard of these understandings. However, he raised no question about them
                            nor did he seem surprised. He concentrated instead on the inadequacy of
                            the public statement suggested in paragraph four<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Paragraph 4 of <ref target="#d4">Document
                                4</ref>.</note> and on the need for the US to make some statement of
                            its own which would reassure the Danish people. We should at least say
                            that there have been no nuclear overflights since the accident. I
                            replied that it would be unwise to attempt to work out at this point any
                            statement going beyond the one proposed in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 103632<note n="7" xml:id="d3fn7">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3, Document 2</ref>.</note> which we
                            have not used because it did not <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0041"/>fully meet the desires of the Danish Government. I said that it seemed
                            to me the only sensible course was for him first to report to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> the informal record
                            of the remarks which I had made so that he could view the matter in
                            perspective. If the Danish Government then wished to raise with us the
                            question of an additional public statement by the U.S. we would, of
                            course, be willing to look at their suggestions. I reminded him,
                            however, of the language in paragraph four of my remarks that the
                            “U.S. Government must continue to stand by its policy of not
                            confirming or denying publicly the presence of nuclear weapons on its
                            aircraft or bases anywhere in the world”. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> agreed with this course of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> then said that since we
                            have caused all the trouble we should make some public statement
                            expressing regret and our understanding for the concern of the Danish
                            people. I undertook to explore the possibility of releasing a statement
                            along these lines at the earliest suitable occasion. </p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> did not explicitly press
                            for assurances for the future (carefully omitted from the record of my
                            remarks), but indicated that the Danish Government was greatly concerned
                            over the nuclear question in general and would no doubt wish to pursue
                            it further. I said that we wanted to be sure that the outgoing
                            government, which had been in power when our understandings had been
                            reached, was fully informed and would of course always be willing to
                            discuss these questions with the incoming government. </p>

                        <p>1. Our review of the record indicates that in 1957 we determined that the
                            effective operation of the strategic deterrent would require <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0042"/>sometime in the future storage of nuclear
                            weapons at Thule, Greenland. Our records indicate that while we believed

                            to store these weapons at Thule, nevertheless, we considered it
                            important to determine whether your Government wished to be informed
                            prior to introducing nuclear weapons into Greenland. Accordingly, our
                            Ambassador made an approach of this nature to the then Prime Minister
                            Hansen on November 13, 1957.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Ambassador
                                Peterson advised such a course of action in telegram 376, October
                                31, 1957, in the belief that the “general spirit of
                                Dano-United States relations and cooperation in Greenland in defense
                                matters puts us under moral obligation to be frank and open with
                                Prime Minister on matter of such potential political importance for
                                Denmark.” The Department authorized an approach to Hansen
                                in telegram 499, November 8. In telegram 406, November 13, Peterson
                                reported that he had met that day with Hansen, who, because of the
                                issue's “serious psychological and political
                                implications,” wanted to study it and meet again in a few

                            18, 1957, Prime Minister Hansen gave our Ambassador a written statement
                            which he characterized as informal, personal, highly secret and limited
                            to one copy each on the Danish and American side.<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4"> Peterson reported on the November 18 meeting and
                                Hansen's statement in telegram 419 from Copenhagen,
                                November 18, 1957. Peterson indicated that Hansen asked him to
                                consider his copy of the statement “purely
                                personal.” (Department of State, Danish Desk Files: Lot
                                73 D 167, Thule Crash—Internal Memos) No copy of
                                Hansen's statement has been found. In telegram 105056 to
                                Copenhagen, January 26, 1968, the Department indicated that it could
                                not locate a copy of Hansen's statement and asked whether
                                the document or a copy existed in Embassy files. (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, Denmark, Vol. 1) The Embassy
                                replied in the negative. (Telegram 2933, January 26; ibid) The text
                                of Hansen's statement, from Danish archives, is printed

                            Government's view of the Base Agreement and that we had not

                            attitude of the Danish Government. The Prime Minister concluded that in
                            these circumstances no comment on his part was necessary. He was
                            adamant, however, that there should be no publicity now or later since
                            any kind of leak could be highly damaging to our two countries. Inasmuch

                                Ramberg emphasized that Danish officials had always regarded this as
                                an expression of the belief that nuclear weapons should not be
                                stored on the soil of European Denmark. Ramberg was sure
                                Hansen's remarks were uttered in a context that excluded
                                Greenland. “At most, one might say prohibition against
                                storage of nuclear weapons on Greenland was intended; certainly
                                prohibition against overflights was never
                                contemplated—particularly since overflights were
                                guaranteed by 1951 treaty.” (National Archives and

                            operations from Thule was discussed early in 1964 by Under Secretary for
                            Greenland Brun and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> in relation to an accident in the state of

                                in telegram 519 from Copenhagen, February 6. (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, Denmark, Vol. 1)</note> This
                            discussion frankly addressed the possibility that a similar accident
                            could arise as a result of operations involving nuclear weapons at or
                            near Thule which would raise difficult questions in the Folketing.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> suggested that
                            if such an unfortunate incident ever occurred, the Danish Government
                            could state that U.S. activities in Greenland had as their sole object
                            the defense interests of the Free World and that they had been worked
                            out in full cooperation with Danish defense forces and the Danish
                            Government under terms and conditions of the 1951 Defense Agreement and
                            in accordance with over-all Danish policies. Under Secretary Brun made
                            no objection to this proposal and pursued the matter no further.</p>
                        <p>3. In connection with overflights of Greenland, the effective operation
                            of the strategic deterrent has also required that such flights involving
                            nuclear weapons be carried on from time to time in accordance with
                            Article V (3) of the 1951 Defense Agreement. </p>
                        <p>4. As for the current situation [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>], nor are there now any
                            overflights of Greenland by U.S. strategic aircraft. </p>
                        <p>I wish to emphasize again that in view of the sensitivity of military
                            operations with nuclear weapons, the United States Government must
                            continue to stand by its policy of neither confirming nor denying
                            publicly the presence of nuclear weapons on its aircraft or bases
                            anywhere in the world. In addition, I urge that your Government in
                            addressing this problem publicly in the future limit itself to a
                            statement along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>“U.S. operations in Greenland are the subject of regular
                            consultation between the two Governments and are in accord with the 1951
                            Defense Agreement as well as their respective policies. The Government
                            of Denmark is fully aware in this connection of its responsibilities to
                            the Danish people in Greenland for their safety and defense. We are
                            fully satisfied that the interests of the Danish people are being
                            protected.”</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0044"/>
                        <p>5. We hope that all public statements on this matter by either Government
                            will be subject to consultation between the two Governments.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> was received by
                            the Secretary at 2:15 p.m. Jan 28<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">Just prior
                                to meeting with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>. A memorandum of their

                                    <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967-69, DEF
                                17.</note> and stated <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName>
                            had instructed him to seek US approval of the statement text of which
                            already sent us by Amb White: “The Danish Govt which has had
                            contacts with the US Govt is in a position to confirm that in conformity
                            with Danish atomic policy there are no nuclear weapons in Greenland, and
                            no overflights of Greenland by planes carrying such weapons are
                            undertaken.”</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary stated he wished to make two observations: (a) Danish as
                            well as US security depends upon US nuclear arrangements from which
                            those countries receiving this protection cannot claim complete
                            disassociation as if nuclear weapons did not exist, and (b) we have
                            serious problem of how to deal with events in one country so as not to
                            set up a chain reaction with other countries throughout world that could
                            impair the American nuclear deterrent. To deal with this second problem
                            we have adopted the policy of neither confirming nor denying the
                            presence of our nuclear weapons and have adhered to it rigidly. There is
                            a difference between what the United States can say and what Denmark can
                            say.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary noted that the proposed Danish statement associates it
                            with the United States thus putting the United States in the position of
                            confirming it, a departure from our policy. He then gave the Ambassador
                            the following shorter statement and asked if the Danish Government might
                            wish to say something along these lines: “The Danish
                            Government confirms that there are no nuclear weapons stored in
                            Greenland and no overflights of Greenland with nuclear
                            weapons.” <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0045"/>The Secretary
                            stressed that if we were queried about such a statement issued by the
                            Danish Government, we would refuse to comment. While we deeply regretted
                            the crash, Danish public opinion is the Danish Government's
                            problem, not ours, and one to be dealt with by a purely Danish
                            statement. </p>
                        <p>4. Should any question of violation of our international obligations
                            arise, the Secretary reminded the Ambassador of the secret
                            understandings referred to in Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>'s informal memorandum
                            to the Ambassador. (Nodis <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s
                            106058 and 106059.)<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref> and <ref target="#d5fn3">footnote 3</ref>
                                thereto.</note> The Ambassador stated that he had been instructed to
                            comment along the following lines on this point: “In light of
                            the background of later developments, the Danish Govt considered that
                            the historical observations made in the memorandum are considered to be
                            without importance in the prevailing concrete situation.” In
                            that connection, the Ambassador referred to the many public
                            pronouncements on Danish nuclear policy since the signing of the
                            Greenland Agreement in 1951,<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">See <ref target="#d4fn2">footnote 2, Document 4</ref>.</note> including a
                            statement in Parliament in April 1964 that Danish nuclear policy
                            includes Greenland.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary replied that if the interpretation of “no
                            importance” means that the question of the understandings is
                            merely being put aside, that would cause no problem; but we could not
                            accept an interpretation of it by which we could be accused of violating
                            our understandings with Denmark.</p>
                        <p>6. Replying to the Ambassador's inquiry about the question of
                            future overflights, the Secretary said he thought the text given the
                            Ambassador covered the immediate problem and the question of the future
                            could be left to the new government.</p>
                        <p>7. The Amb mentioned the possibility of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> coming to the United States to
                            discuss the problem. The Secretary made remarks which made it clear to
                            Ronne that such a visit would not be welcome. He regretted that he would
                            be completely tied up with the Korean problem and would not be in a
                            position to receive the Foreign Minister on Monday, after which time
                                <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Tabor</persName> might not be in office.
                            The Ambassador commented that there was probably nothing more that Tabor
                            could accomplish in any event. He said he would promptly inform
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJO1">Krag</persName> of our proposal.<note n="5" xml:id="d5fn5">On January 29 the Danish Government issued the

                        <p>The crash near the Thule Base of the B-52 carrying nuclear weapons has
                            increased criticism throughout the Scandinavian countries of US military
                            policies. Such criticism was already substantial because of their
                            dislike of the United States' Vietnam policy. This criticism
                            could become strong enough to cause the governments of Denmark, Iceland,
                            and possibly Norway to demand formal assurances from the US that no
                            planes carrying nuclear weapons overfly their countries.</p>

                            Greenland only because it was seeking an emergency landing site, demands
                            are rising in all political parties for an investigation into the

                            have aroused widespread suspicion. All parties support the
                            government's policy that no nuclear weapons may enter Danish
                            territory (Greenland is considered an integral part of Denmark), and it
                            appears likely that the new government currently being formed will feel
                            forced to seek formal assurances from the US that such flights will not
                            be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>How far the new government will go in restricting US military actions in
                            and over Greenland will depend to a large extent on its composition. It
                            now seems almost certain that this government, which is expected to be
                            announced on February 1, will be a coalition of the rightist
                            Conservative and Moderate Liberal Parties, who are the most friendly of
                            all Danish parties to the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            and of the centrist Radical Liberal Party, which is pacifist-inclined.
                            The leaders of the Radical Liberals, particularly their parliamentary
                            spokesman, Hilmer Baunsgaard, who is expected to head the new
                            government, are not formally opposed to Denmark's current
                            security arrangements, including membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, they may attribute some of their heavy gains
                            in the election-they doubled their parliamentary representation-<pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0047"/>to their campaign for drastic
                            defense cuts and a referendum on Denmark's continued
                            membership in NATO after 1969.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Some Leftists May Push for Anti-US Policies.</hi> Many
                            of the Radical Liberals' new supporters and some of their
                            newly elected parliamentary deputies are anti-militarists in foreign
                            policy who will exploit the B-52 crash, as well as the rising fear among
                            Danes of US policies in Vietnam and elsewhere in the Far East, to try to
                            reduce Denmark's ties to the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to put it on a more neutralist path. These Radical
                            Liberals will be supported by the parliamentary delegations of the far
                            left Venstresocialister Party (VS) and the Socialist People's
                            Party (SPP) and by some of the left-wing Social Democratic deputies.
                            This combination of these Radical Liberals, VS, SPP, and left-wing
                            social Democrats could not effect any basic changes in
                            Denmark's foreign and defense policies because the great
                            majority of the Parliament agrees on their continuation. Yet, the key
                            parliamentary position of the Radical Liberals makes it likely that they
                            will feel that they can force the government to request explicit US
                            assurances that nuclear-armed planes will not overfly Greenland, to cut
                            defense spending, and to call a referendum on continued Danish
                            membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> after 1969.</p>

                            are highly sensitive about Icelandic sovereignty over the Keflavik Base,
                            are also concerned over the B-52 incident. Foreign Minister Jonsson has
                            already felt obliged to state that the US is observing his
                            country's policy, which forbids any nuclear weapons on
                            Icelandic territory. The erroneous impression has spread that there is a
                            formal agreement between Iceland and the US concerning storage of
                            nuclear weapons at the base and flights of aircraft carrying nuclear
                            weapons. If the Danish Government requests explicit assurances regarding
                            the overflight of nuclear-armed planes, popular pressures in Iceland may
                            increase to the point where the government will be forced to seek such a
                            formal agreement with the US. However, US-Icelandic relations have
                            improved so much and the present Independence Party-Social Democratic
                            coalition has been so friendly toward the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that the US can expect
                            it—and particularly Prime Minister Benediktsson—to
                            do everything possible to contain worries concerning flights of US
                            planes over Iceland.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Norway Least Concerned.</hi> Of the three Scandinavian
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Norway is the least
                            affected by the B-52 incident. However, memories of the 1960 U-2 affair,
                            when suspicions arose that the US was using a Norwegian base at Bodo for
                            activities that Norwegian officials knew nothing about, are still fresh.
                            That episode, and the similarity between the Danish and Norwegian
                            criticisms of US policy in Vietnam, lead us to believe that the
                            Norwegian Government would most likely follow the lead of Denmark if the
                            latter sought formal assurances from the US that no nuclear-arms-bearing
                            flights will be made over its territory. <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0048"/>However, as in the case of Iceland, the four-party
                            coalition in Norway is basically friendly to the US and can be counted
                            on to try to prevent any serious strain on US-Norwegian relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Potential for Strains in Relations.</hi> How far the
                            Scandinavian governments that are members of NATO will go in their
                            demands for concrete assurances concerning overflights of nuclear-armed
                            aircraft will depend to a great extent on their impression of US actions
                            and policies concerning this issue. If the Danish Government fails to
                            get such assurances, it and possibly also the Icelandic Government may
                            have great difficulty in withstanding public pressure for forcing
                            renegotiation of current base agreements to have explicit guarantees
                            against such overflights and storage of nuclear weapons written into
                            them. If relations reach this point, Denmark and Iceland might also seek
                            to assume greater control over all US activities at Thule and
                            Keflavik.</p>

                        <p>1. Amb <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName>, who came to small
                            dinner informally at my home last evening, informed me he is working
                            with Under Secretary Fischer preparing instructions to govern him when
                            he returns to Washington. I gathered that the Danes are exploring
                            possibilities and still hope to hit upon a formula for publicly
                            prohibiting nuclear weapons in Greenland or overflights by planes
                            carrying them that U.S. can accept. He emphasized that exchanges of
                            notes or statement by U.S. which would satisfy Danish public opinion had
                            somehow to be devised.</p>
                        <p>2. He said Danish Govt wanted to avoid renegotiation of Greenland defense
                            treaty. To try to renegotiate it would open up far more serious problems
                            than it would solve. Among other things he said sensitivity of
                            Greenlanders must be borne in mind. Greenland had more autonomy now than
                            when 1951 treaty was negotiated. In any renegotiation Greenlanders would
                            interject themselves strongly and become complicating factor. Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> observed that in some
                            ways the Greenland <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0049"/>defense treaty
                            smacked of Danish colonialism-a subject of great sensitivity to both
                            Greenlanders and Danes.</p>
                        <p>3. Amb <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> repeated what he has
                            doubtlessly frequently said in Washington; namely, American policy of
                            not confirming nor denying existence of nuclear weapons on Greenland or
                            of overflights of planes carrying them is unduly rigid and the very
                            arbitrariness of this position is a danger to existing status of
                            American bases in Greenland.</p>

                        <p>1. In view of our earlier conversations with the Danes and in view of the
                            resolution passed February 8 by the Danish Parliament (Paragraph 1,
                            attached Talking Points), we expect Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> to seek an appointment in the
                            Department of State in order to request assurances that the US is acting
                            in accord with Danish nuclear policy in Greenland. They will probably
                            request either a public <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> statement
                            and/or an exchange of notes between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that some formal <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            assurance is necessary in order to maintain our present defense
                            capability in Greenland. We wish to avoid taking a stance so rigid as to
                            cause the Danes to question the desirability of retaining the 1951
                            Agreement on the Defense of Greenland. The Danes have not raised this
                            point and probably do not now intend to. However, we believe that both
                            State and Defense should keep in mind the fact that the Danes do hold
                            the strongest cards in any bargaining sessions.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0050"/>
                        <p>3. Danish nuclear policy encompasses one basic ambiguity; i.e., on the
                            one hand they wish to demonstrate that all Danish territory is free of
                            nuclear weapons; on the other hand, they realize that
                            Denmark's security ultimately depends on the US nuclear
                            deterrent.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe that the attached statement (Talking Point 5) meets this
                            situation. It provides [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] and allows the <gloss target="#t_GOD1">GOD</gloss> to make a policy decision, in time of grave danger, to
                            allow nuclear deployment and/or overflights.</p>
                        <p>5. Both we and the Danes realize that a situation might conceivably arise
                            where there would be no time for consultations before initiating
                            overflights or deployment. We believe that this contingency can best be
                            handled by an oral statement such as the Undersecretary made to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> on February
                                2.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">

                            Storage in Greenland</p>
                        <p>1. The Danish Parliament on February 8 passed a nearly unanimous
                            resolution stating that, “Inasmuch as Parliament presumes
                            that the Government, in attempting to obtain absolute guarantees that no
                                <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0051"/>nuclear weapons are stored in
                            Greenland and that Greenland air space is maintained as a zone free of
                            atomic weapons, will make certain that Danish atomic policy will be
                            maintained in all parts of the realm and Danish sovereignty will be
                            respected, the house continues its debate on the proposed budget bill
                            for the fiscal year 1968-69.”</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to give the Danish
                            Government assurance on a confidential basis that we will not store
                            nuclear weapons in Greenland or overfly Greenland with aircraft carrying
                            nuclear weapons except as a result of a joint Danish-US decision that
                            such storage or overflights were necessitated by a threat to Free World
                            security.</p>
                        <p>3. As Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                            indicated it must be recognized that in circumstances of extreme
                            emergency the situation may not permit advance consultation.</p>
                        <p>4. In our view such a statement would meet the current needs of the
                            Danish Government and preclude a stronger stand on their part that could
                            call into question the entire 1951 Agreement on the Defense of
                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>5. Under the circumstances, we would suggest that the Danish Government
                            might wish to make a statement along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>“On the basis of recent discussions with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, the Government is satisfied that
                            United States activities in Greenland are and will continue to be in
                            accord with Danish nuclear policies.”</p>
                        <p>6. As the Ambassador is aware the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            cannot publicly confirm any statement on the deployment of its nuclear
                            weapons which may be made by the Danish Government, nor can it agree to
                            make public any assurance it has given to the Danish Government.</p>

                            not been a significant problem thus far. Excellent cooperation among
                            Danish and American officials began at Thule <gloss target="#t_AFB1">AFB</gloss> and is continuing. As a result, official statements by

                                ibid.)</note> have been very favorable to US interests. Emphasis on
                            US/Danish cooperation and negation of the hazards to life in Northwest
                            Greenland seem to have helped to minimize public reaction to the

                            ingested or inhaled in large quantities. None of those working at the
                            site have encountered serious contamination. The alpha particles do not
                            penetrate through the skin, and no significant amount has been detected
                            in the air.</p>
                        <p>The contamination has been relatively fixed in the ice and snow in the
                            immediate area of the crash. A “gentlemen's
                            agreement” concluded on February 16 in Copenhagen provides
                            that we will undertake to remove about 50 percent of the contaminated
                            ice and snow.<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">The agreement was transmitted in

                            massive undertaking, but we believe that General Hunziker can do the
                            job.</p>

                            were affected by the crash. They hunt seal, walrus, and small whale for
                            a livelihood. The area of the crash, one of the best hunting grounds, is
                            now a restricted zone. We expect that compensatory claims will be made,
                            but the Danish Government has not yet done so.</p>

                            crash area and should not be affected by contamination. Nevertheless,

                        <p>Dear John:</p>

                            the question of US-Danish nuclear weapons policies,<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">The February 16 draft, a copy of which is in the

                        <p>The following is a draft of an Aide-Meémoire (or Note, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> etc., depending upon the form in which
                            the Danish Ambassador presents the Danish position to the Secretary), in
                            response to the anticipated Danish request for an exchange of notes on
                            nuclear weapons in and over Denmark and its territories.</p>
                        <p>1. The United States Government is prepared to give the Danish Government
                            assurance on a confidential basis that we will not store nuclear weapons
                            in Greenland except with Danish approval.</p>
                        <p>2. The United States Government is also prepared to give the Danish
                            Government assurance on a confidential basis that we will not overfly
                            Greenland with aircraft carrying nuclear weapons except in consultation
                            with the Danish Government. It must be recognized, however, that in
                            circumstances of extreme emergency the situation may make advance
                            consultation difficult.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0054"/>
                        <p>3. Fundamental security considerations prohibit the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> from publicly commenting in any way on
                            the deployment or movement of its nuclear weapons. </p>
                        <p>4. The United States Government recognizes that the Danish Government
                            desires that a public statement be made on the immediate question of the
                            B-52 crash in Greenland. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            suggests that if the Danish Government feels it must make a statement,
                            it might be along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>“The Government is satisfied that United States activities in
                            Greenland are and will continue to be in accord with Danish nuclear
                            policies.”</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could, of course, in no way
                            confirm or comment on any such statement issued by the Danish
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>No. 93. USA.8</p>
                        <p>Sir:</p>
                        <p>1. With reference to our recent discussions regarding defense
                            arrangements in Greenland, I have the honor to inform you that the
                            Danish Government has considered the lack of consistency between the
                            declared Danish policy on nuclear weapons on the one hand and the
                            agreement of April 27, 1951, between our two governments concerning the
                            defense of Greenland on the other.</p>
                        <p>2. The Danish Government appreciates the assurances recently given by the
                            United States Government that there are no nuclear weapons in Greenland
                            and that no overflights with such weapons are taking place. My
                            Government has also noted with satisfaction the undertaking given by
                            your Government that this situation will not be changed without prior
                            consultation with the Danish Government.</p>
                        <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0055"/>
                        <p>3. The declaration made by the Danish Government at the opening session
                            of the Danish Parliament on February 6, 1968, included the following
                            section:</p>
                        <p>“It is the policy of the Government that no nuclear weapons
                            should be found within Danish territory. This policy is also valid for
                            Greenland and for Greenland air space.”</p>
                        <p>4. On February 8 the Danish Parliament passed a resolution to the same
                            effect and requesting the Government to get absolute guarantees that no
                            nuclear weapons are stored in Greenland and that Greenland air space is
                            kept free of such weapons so as to ensure that Danish nuclear policy is
                            maintained in all parts of the realm.</p>
                        <p>5. I am instructed to ask the U.S. Government that discussions be
                            initiated with a view to reaching agreement as soon as possible between
                            our two governments on supplementing the agreement of April 27, 1951,
                            concerning the defense of Greenland to the effect that no nuclear
                            weapons may under the agreement be stored in or introduced into
                            Greenland including Greenland air space. </p>
                        <p>Please accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest
                                consideration.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">In a March 13 note to

                        <p>Dear Paul:</p>
                        <p>Your letter of February 24 and the Danish note to the Secretary<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">
                                <ref target="#d10">Documents 10</ref> and <ref target="#d11">11</ref>.</note> arrived here within a few hours of one
                            another.</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0056"/>
                        <p>We have now prepared a response that reflects the note itself as well as
                            your suggestions of February 24. I have enclosed a copy of our proposed
                                reply,<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">Not attached, but see the
                                attachment to <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note> as well
                            as of our negotiating points for the anticipated negotiations.<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">Not attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since the Danes did not, in their note, request a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> public statement, but rather, chose to raise that
                            matter orally, we do not plan to address this question in the note
                            itself but as a separate but related issue. </p>
                        <p>Our first paragraph calls for a joint decision of the two Governments for
                            both storage and overflights, rather than only storage, as you had
                            proposed. The reasons for this change are: (a) The Danes have
                            specifically asked for equal assurance on both points, and (b) we feel
                            that the second paragraph of our reply provides the US with the
                            flexibility necessary in the event of future emergencies.</p>
                        <p>The first paragraph of our response also takes into account
                            Denmark's desire to supplement the 1951 Agreement on the
                            Defense of Greenland. We see no objection to doing this in a classified
                            note inasmuch as the practical effect of the assurances we propose will
                            in fact be to modify rights which the Danes agree were accorded us by
                            the 1951 Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Our statement on crisis consultation in regard to overflights is designed
                            to place on record, as you do, the idea that conditions may make such
                            consultation difficult.</p>
                        <p>I agree with your method of stating the need to avoid public comment on
                            nuclear weapons deployment. We do, however, feel that we should, in such
                            a statement, cite our mutual responsibilities to all of the Alliance
                            members.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the public statement to be made by the Danes, we believe
                            that the phrase “On the basis of recent discussions with the
                            United States Government hellip;” is necessary. Since we
                            propose to tell the Danes that we will not publicly confirm their
                            statement, we feel that we cannot expect them to limit a unilateral
                            Danish Government statement in the way that you suggest. Indeed, there
                            is little to prevent the Danes from issuing a much stronger unilateral
                            statement than the one we propose. While it is true that the Danish
                            Government made a statement on January 29 that did not cite discussions
                            with the US Government,<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">See <ref target="#d5fn5">footnote 5, Document 5</ref>.</note> they
                            were far from satisfied with that arrangement. We believe that if we had
                            not been dealing with a recently defeated, caretaker Government, we
                            would have encountered strong, continuous pressure for US confirmation
                            of the Danish announcement. We consider a statement <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0057"/>along the lines of that given in our
                            negotiating points to be the minimum that the new Government could
                            accept, especially in view of its publicly stated intention of seeking
                            US agreement on nuclear matters.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we hope to work out with the Danes some sort of agreement and
                            accompanying public statement that will remove this question from the
                            public arena and that will insure our continued access to Greenland as a
                            radar site and as an air route and/or deployment site in future
                            emergencies. I believe that our proposed draft will accomplish this. I
                            look forward to receiving your views as a matter of urgency.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName>, at his
                            request, called on Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> at 5:00 pm March 8. He was accompanied by Fergo.
                            Ambassador said he was leaving March 11 for lecture tour of 16 to 18
                            days duration. He asked if there had been any developments in regard to
                            Danish note of February 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">
                                <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied that we were working with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and hoped to have a reply soon.
                            At Ambassador's request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> agreed to April 1 meeting with Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> asked if we had
                            any preference for manner of implementing proposed supplement to 1951
                            Agreement on Defense of Greenland. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that our preference would be for a
                            confidential exchange of notes. We had not been thinking in terms of a
                            formal agreement that would legally preclude nuclear storage and/or
                            overflights (as distinct from undertakings providing for consultation)
                            and we could not, of course, publish any agreement on this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0058"/>
                        <p>3. At this point the Ambassador presented the following two alternative
                            drafts for a “Danish/American Agreement about nuclear policy
                            in Greenland.”</p>
                        <p>“Alternative 1. Activities under present agreement shall not
                            include the storing in and introduction into Greenland territory
                            including Greenland air space of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Alternative 2. Under the present agreement no nuclear weapons may be
                            stored in or introduced into Greenland territory including Greenland air
                            space.”</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> again raised doubts
                            about the wisdom of a formal amendment to the agreement that would
                            legally and permanently preclude nuclear weapons in or overflights of
                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador then raised question of public statement. He said public
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> confirmation of absence nuclear
                            weapons in and over Greenland necessary due to pressures in Parliament.
                            He said that he saw <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> statement as way
                            to put an end to public and parliamentary discussion of matter. He added
                            that such discussion could only raise new problems in regard to
                            Greenland. He said that he understood our policy considerations but
                            pointed out that Denmark, out of loyalty to US had gone against its own
                            standing policy during recent Chicom representation problem in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council.</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out necessity
                            of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> adhering to no comment practice
                            re nuclear deployment and overflights. He said that departure from this
                            practice would jeopardize US nuclear deterrent; that this was a security
                            question that involves all of us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out that issue was wider than Danish US
                            question; that if we made exception for Danes we would then have this
                            exception cited to us by every country with a current or future nuclear
                            question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> also asked
                            why, if Danish Government said categorically that there was no nuclear
                            storage in or overflights of Greenland, the Danish people would not
                            believe their own Government. He also asked if Soviets were providing
                            Denmark with assurances they were not overflying Danish territory with
                            nuclear weapons (at this point Fergo pointed out that Danes never knew
                            if Soviet ships transiting Danish home waters did or did not carry
                            nukes). Ambassador said, with no great conviction, that Soviets had
                            stated they did not operate nuclear overflights.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> concluded Greenland
                            discussion by stating that we were conscious of the extent of the
                            problem and that we hoped, on the Ambassador's return, to
                            have something to put on table and discuss.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> then remarked that he had
                            recently met Dobrynin at social function and that latter had asked if
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> had seen recent
                            newspaper articles on US overflight suspension and asked if the Danes
                            had seen any confirmation of this decision. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> had replied <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0059"/>that he was only concerned with
                            overflights of Danish territory, concerning which he had no misgivings
                            on US policy.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> then asked if we intended
                            to reply to Soviet Aide-Mémoire of February 10.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">The aide-mémoire was transmitted in

                            should reply, that a reply was in preparation, but that we were in no
                            hurry. He pointed out, however, that in the context of US-Soviet
                            relations, it was not unheard of to let such a message go unanswered.
                            (On leaving the building, Fergo expressed to SCAN officer the hope that
                            Danes would be consulted in advance of any reply to the Soviet

                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>We have, subsequently, told the Danish Ambassador that our preference was
                            for a secret exchange of notes that would make nuclear overflights and
                            storage in Greenland subject to consultation between our two
                            Governments. The Danes have indicated that they are willing to accept

                        <p>We have drawn up a draft note (Tab A) which has been approved by the

                        <p>Our draft is designed to:</p>
                        <p>(a) assure the Danes that we are not now overflying Greenland with
                            nuclear weapons or storing such weapons in Greenland;</p>
                        <p>(b) allow for nuclear overflights or storage in the future if both
                            Governments deem such action advisable; and</p>
                        <p>(c) point out to the Danes that there may be conditions of extreme
                            emergency under which consultations with respect to overflights would be
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>If you concur, I plan to give a draft copy of our note to the Danish

                        <p>The United States Government assures the Government of Denmark that,
                            notwithstanding the provisions of the 1951 Agreement on the Defense of
                            Greenland, it will not store nuclear weapons in Greenland or overfly
                            Greenland with aircraft carrying nuclear weapons except as a result of a

                            and Fergo, <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> presented draft

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said first paragraph,
                            calling for joint decision, presented no problem. He questioned both
                            need and feasibility for including second paragraph (which states that
                            consultation may be difficult under emergency conditions). Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> and Fergo felt that the
                            Foreign Office would object to the language of the second paragraph.
                            They suggested omitting the second paragraph on the ground that the
                            situation it addresses does not appear to need any spelling out in
                            advance. </p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out that,
                            following the Thule crash, a lack of awareness of certain agreements on
                            the part of high Danish Government officials had caused a delay of a
                            full week in clarifying the situation between our two Governments. He
                            proposed however, that Dept consult with Defense again on point
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> raised and that
                            meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> not transmit text
                            to his Foreign Office. Ambassador agreed readily and pointed out present
                            text, if sent to Foreign Office, could create negative reaction
                            unhelpful to our discussions.</p>
                        <p>4. In regard to <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName>'s
                            question about public statement, <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> suggested that, for present, Government, if asked
                            in Parliament, state that discussions with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on matter are continuing.</p>

                        <p>Dear Paul:</p>
                        <p>As you know from our reporting cable,<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">
                                <ref target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> told us on April 1 that the second
                            paragraph, the “escape clause” of our proposed
                                note,<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">Attachment to <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> would be unacceptable to the Danish
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In his discussion with me, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> indicated that he understood the problem that we
                            were addressing in Paragraph 2 of our draft but stated that this
                            situation need not be spelled out in advance. The implication of what
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said is that in a
                            serious crisis it goes without saying that military requirements would
                            be overriding. While a written escape clause might nevertheless be
                            helpful in justifying an overflight of Greenland in an instance where
                            time did not allow us to obtain the agreement of the Danish Government,
                            I do not believe that the lack of such a written understanding would
                            critically limit our freedom of action in circumstances of a grave and
                            sudden threat. Therefore, I propose that we offer the Danes only the
                            first paragraph in reply to their note of February 26.<note n="4" xml:id="d16fn4">
                                <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall, on presenting our reply, reiterate the possible requirement for
                            U.S. overflights under the circumstances described above: i.e., those
                            where a grave and sudden threat does not allow time to obtain the
                            agreement of the Danish Government.</p>
                        <p>This solution of course, will not involve an outright prohibition of
                            nuclear weapons flights over Greenland, as the Danes proposed in their
                            February 26 note. Further, it should serve to prevent this issue from
                            jeopardizing the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement under which we operate
                            electronic surveillance systems in that territory and maintain the air
                            base at Thule. </p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your comments at an early date.</p>

                        <p>Dear John:</p>
                        <p>This is in reply to your letter of April 17, 1968,<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">
                                <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note> in which you propose a
                            compromise classified reply to the Danish note of February 26 on nuclear
                            storage in and overflights of Greenland.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">

                            proposed reply if, as you suggest in your letter, you reiterate to the
                            Danish Ambassador the possible requirement for US overflights with
                            nuclear weapons in a serious crisis without advance notification or
                            approval, and if you furnish him a memorandum of your conversation with
                            him to this effect, which would serve as a record that this important
                            point had been discussed with him. We hope that, in accordance with your
                            own expressed expectation, this compromise reply will serve to prevent
                            this nuclear weapons issue from jeopardizing the important 1951 Defense
                            of Greenland Agreement.</p>
                        <p>You make no mention in your April 17 letter of the earlier Danish request
                            for the United States Government's association with a public
                            statement on the subject of nuclear overflights of or storage of nuclear
                            weapons in Greenland. Our position continues to be that no such
                            statement should be made, that we hope the Danes will make no such
                            statement, and that we could not confirm any such statement if they do
                            choose to make one.</p>

                                    footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> you stated that the United
                            States Government was prepared to discuss with the Danes the matter of
                            supplementing the Agreement of April 27, 1951 concerning the Defense of
                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>The Danish Ambassador has tentatively agreed that any such supplement
                            should take the form of a secret exchange of notes. He has also agreed
                            that future nuclear overflights and storage in Greenland should be
                            subject to consultation between our two Governments. The latter
                            provision is in contrast to the Danish request, stated in their February
                            26 note, for an unconditional ban on nuclear overflights and storage in
                            Greenland.</p>
                        <p>On March 31 the Under Secretary authorized me to offer the Danish
                            Ambassador a draft text (Tab B)<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Attachment to
                                    <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> for the
                            consideration of his Government. The Ambassador, on April 1, read our
                            draft and indicated that the first paragraph, which makes nuclear
                            overflights and storage subject to consultation, would be acceptable to
                            his Government. He felt, however, that the Danish Foreign Ministry would
                            object to the second paragraph, in which we pointed out that there may
                            be conditions of extreme emergency under which consultation with respect
                            to overflights would be difficult. He suggested omitting the second
                            paragraph since the situation it addresses does not need spelling out in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>After further consultation with the Department of Defense we are now
                            prepared to offer the Danes, as a draft text, the first paragraph only
                            of our April 1 text (Tab A),<note n="4" xml:id="d18fn4">Printed
                                below.</note> accompanied by an oral notation on my part, pointing
                            out that there could be a requirement for U.S. overflights under
                            conditions of a grave and sudden threat that did not allow time to
                            obtain the agreement of the Danish Government.</p>

                        <p>If you concur, I plan to give a draft copy of our note to the Danish
                            Ambassador this week, and tell him that we would be prepared to use that
                            text in a secret exchange of notes supplementing the 1951 Agreement on
                            the Defense of Greenland. I would, at that time, point out again the
                            possible need for U.S. overflights without consultation, under the
                            conditions described above. </p>

                            letter); recalled that <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> had
                            said first paragraph presented no problems for Danes but had suggested
                            omission of second paragraph on basis that situation it addresses did
                            not need spelling out in advance.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> gave <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> draft text consisting of first
                            paragraph only of April 1 text. He said that if Danish Fonoff approves
                            text, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prepared to incorporate same
                            in formal exchange of notes in near future.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that at time of
                            exchange of notes he would reiterate possible requirement for US
                            overflights under circumstances of a grave and sudden threat that does
                            not allow time to obtain agreement of Danish Government. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will retain record of this
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> asked if he would be
                            obliged to report <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>'s oral statement to his Government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied that was
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName>'s decision.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that oral statement
                            appeared to make the proposed agreement less than binding. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out that the written
                            agreement would be governing instrument; that, as in case of any US
                            agreement, we would abide by it to full extent of our ability to do so;
                            but that circumstances beyond our control could make overflights without
                            consultation necessary. He pointed out that we are not asking Danes to
                            give written permission for such overflights, but that we must make
                            clear the possible need for same in event of a grave and sudden threat
                            that would not allow time for consultations. </p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> asked why new draft was
                            classified secret rather than confidential, as in the case of Danish
                            February 26 note and US reply to that note. It was pointed out that
                            Danish note had been request to initiate discussions on supplementing
                            1951 agreement in regard to nuclear overflights and storage in Greenland
                            and that US in reply had agreed to enter into such discussions. Text
                            under consideration was different matter since it embodied a specific
                            limitation on deployment and movement of US nuclear weapons; hence must
                            be secret.</p>
                        <p>7. In reply to Ambassador's question on public statement,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that we should
                            first give Danish Government chance to consider text. He stressed that
                            in any case, we cannot confirm or deny any statement concerning
                            deployment or movement of nuclear weapons. </p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said pressure from press
                            remained heavy and that Danish Government must be able to issue
                            statement referring to negotiations and US agreement to exclude nuclear
                            weapons from Greenland. </p>
                        <p>9. In reply <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said again that
                            we will not join Danes in such a statement; nor could we confirm any
                            statement on the negotiations. He said that Danish Government can say
                            that there were no nuclear <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0067"/>weapons in or over Greenland and that there would not be any without
                            the Danish Government's approval. The Danish Government, he
                            said, is free to give its people full assurances on any aspect of this
                            question. We cannot, however, fracture our global policy on the US
                            nuclear deterrent by publicly confirming such a statement. He added that
                            no such <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> participation should be
                            required to validate statement by Danish Government to its own people. </p>
                        <p>10. At this point <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> offered
                            text, apparently for public statement, but which <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> did not accept. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> noted it would amount to formal
                            amendment to 1951 Agreement placing absolute ban on nuclear weapons in
                            Greenland thus making it too inflexible. He pointed out that US proposal
                            gave Danes the requested assurances on nuclear weapons but allowed both
                            parties to act quickly if circumstances required nuclear
                            overflights.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> persisted in reiterating
                            need for Danish public reference to negotiations, adding that if we
                            cannot reach agreement here, it would be necessary to consult in
                            Copenhagen under Article XIII (3) of the 1951 Agreement. In reply to
                            repeated statements on need for public statement, <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> again said that Danish Government
                            free to say publicly that it is fully satisfied with current
                            arrangements re Greenland nuclear matters. He pointed out that Danes do
                            not, in practice, publish all of their international agreements and that
                            no other nuclear power has given the sort of public assurances that
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> was asking for. He again
                            urged Danish Government to consider alternatives to their proposed
                            method of assuring their public. </p>
                        <p>12. On leaving, <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that US
                            draft note appears acceptable but that need remained for public
                            statement. </p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName>, accompanied by
                            Counselor Fergo, called on Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> May 16. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said he had just received reply
                            from Fonoff on text and discussion of May 10 meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Summarized in telegram 162867.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said Fonoff had noted the
                            oral statement <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> made May 10
                            re flight requirements in case of grave and sudden threat (para 4 State
                            162867).</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> repeated statement of May
                            10 that due to parliamentary and press pressures Danish Government will
                            need to make a public statement. However, he said his Government accepts
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy of not confirming or
                            denying statements of this kind; that Danes would not request <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> confirmation or mutual statement, but
                            would rather issue unilateral one.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> also confirmed Danish
                            Government would treat exchange of notes as secret.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> then presented following
                            revised text prepared by Danish Fonoff: “The United States
                            Government assures the Government of Denmark that in the exercise of its
                            rights and duties in accordance with the provisions of the agreement of
                            April 27, 1951 concerning the defense of Greenland it will not store
                            nuclear weapons in Greenland or overfly Greenland with aircraft carrying
                            nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>This note and your reply shall constitute an agreement between our two
                            governments and shall be considered an integral part of the defense
                            agreement.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> described Danish proposal as
                            being minor changes in text and procedures of final exchange of
                            notes.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that Danish proposal
                            would amount to an amendment of treaty that would prohibit absolutely
                            nuclear overflights and storage. It made no provision, he noted, for a
                            joint decision to institute nuclear overflights or storage.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said that article XIII (3)
                            allowed for such a decision. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out that that article merely allows both
                            sides to amend treaty by mutual agreement. Our aim, he said, was an
                            agreement that provided flexibility by allowing nuclear overflights
                            quickly, if both sides agree. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> pointed out that our May 10 text<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Attachment to <ref target="#d18">Document
                                18</ref>.</note> had left full control on overflights and storage
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOD1">GOD</gloss>. He asked <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> what problem was with wording that
                            did not allow nuclear overflights or storage without consent <gloss target="#t_GOD1">GOD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> did not defend this aspect Fonoff text, stating
                            only Fonoff evidently did not feel reference to joint decision was
                            needed; that article XIII (3) covered such a possibility. He added he
                            had received text only two hours previously and so had no chance to
                            discuss with Fonoff its rationale on this point. </p>
                        <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0069"/>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that he saw no
                            problem in replacing phrase “Notwithstanding the provisions
                            of the 1951 Agreement on the Defense of Greenland” with
                            wording “in the exercise of its rights and duties in
                            accordance with the provisions of the agreement of April 27, 1951
                            concerning the Defense of Greenland.”</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that first para
                            could be made acceptable by adding to last sentence words
                            “without the consent of the Government of
                            Denmark.” He did not see this as substantive change from US
                            reference to a joint decision and would so inform <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. </p>
                        <p>10. Re final phrase “shall be considered an integral part of
                            the defense agreement” <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said there may be technical problems and he would
                            have to consult Legal Advisor. He noted in this respect that 1951
                            agreement was subject to approval of Danish Parliament although as an
                            executive agreement it was not subject to US Senate approval. </p>
                        <p>11. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> said he would
                            report quickly to his government which is under pressure to settle
                            problem soonest. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> agreed to
                            desirability of moving fast. He saw no reason for delay in exchange of
                            notes if <gloss target="#t_GOD1">GOD</gloss> could agree to his
                            suggested change in para 1 and if second half of last para posed no
                            problem to Legal Advisor. </p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that in regard to
                            oral statement (see para 2) we consider it as having been made.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> concurred.</p>
                        <p>13. At noon May 17, <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> informed

                        <p>The Government of Denmark, shortly after the January 21, 1968 crash of a
                            nuclear armed USAF B-52, requested an absolute ban on nuclear
                            overflights and storage in Greenland. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RT1">Ronne</persName> requested such a ban in his
                            discussions with me and in his February 26 note to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>At that same time, the Danes made repeated requests for U.S.
                            participation in, or endorsement of, a Danish Government announcement
                            that would indicate that Greenland was, in effect, a nuclear free zone.
                            We could not accede to the latter request, although did in confidence
                            give oral assurances to the Danes that we were not overflying Greenland
                            with nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Objectives</p>
                        <p>In our negotiations we sought:</p>
                        <p>a) to retain the right to conduct such nuclear overflights of Greenland
                            as might be required by security;</p>
                        <p>b) to avoid subjecting the entire 1951 Agreement to review and possible
                            modification under terms of Article XIII (3). (It should be noted in
                            this context, that we sought both to retain overflight rights, as noted
                            above, and to maintain our access to Greenland as an important base for
                            electronic surveillance, i.e., BMEWS (ballistic missile early warning
                            system) installations);</p>
                        <p>c) to avoid as far as possible, public discussion of the deployment and
                            movement of U.S. nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effect of the Proposed Settlement</p>
                        <p>We have, after lengthy negotiations with the Danes, reached agreement in
                            principle on the issues noted above. The proposed secret exchange of
                                notes<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> approved of the proposed
                                U.S. note and Danish reply (see <ref target="#d22">Document
                                22</ref>) in response to a May 23 action memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> that reviewed the
                                negotiations and recommended approval. (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Denmark, Vol. 1) President Johnson gave
                                his approval of the U.S. note at a May 29 luncheon meeting with his
                                senior foreign policy advisers. (Record of decisions, May 29; ibid.,
                                Files of <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName>,
                                Meetings with the President, May-June 1968) No record of the
                                luncheon discussion has been found. On May 27 Rostow had forwarded
                                the text of the note to the President under cover of a memorandum
                                that highlighted the negotiations and emphasized that “we
                                will have the right to overfly or store nuclear weapons in Greenland
                                subject to Danish approval (unilaterally in case of emergency); and
                                we will avoid a full scale renegotiation of the 1951
                                agreement.” (Ibid., Country File, Denmark, Vol. 1)</note>
                            accomplishes the following:</p>
                        <p>a) We retain the right to nuclear overflights and storage in Greenland,
                            subject to the agreement of both Governments that such actions are
                            necessary;</p>
                        <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0071"/>
                        <p>b) The Danes are on notice that the U.S. may conduct nuclear overflights
                            under circumstances of a grave and sudden threat that does not allow us
                            time to consult the Danish Government. (The Danish Foreign Office has
                            formally noted my May 10 oral statement<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d19">Document 19</ref>.</note> of this possible
                            need);</p>
                        <p>c) We avoid reopening the 1951 Agreement for renegotiation, thus avoiding
                            any new provisions that might hinder our activities in Greenland
                            including the operation of the Thule Air Base and the maintenance of an
                            extremely important segment of the BMEWS;</p>
                        <p>d) In conjunction with the proposed settlement the Danish Government
                            agreed to drop its request for any U.S. participation in or endorsement
                            of a public statement concerning nuclear weapons in Greenland.</p>

                            agreement between Denmark and the U.S. on storage of U.S. nuclear
                            weapons in Greenland and the overflight of Greenland by U.S. aircraft

                            Governments regarding the request of your Government, made on February
                            26, 1968, that the U.S. and Denmark agree to supplement the Agreement of
                            April 27, 1951 on the Defense of Greenland with respect to the storage
                            of U.S. nuclear weapons in Greenland and the overflight of Greenland by
                            U.S. aircraft carrying nuclear weapons.</p>

                        <p>As a result of these discussions, I have the honor to propose the
                            following Agreement:</p>
                        <p>The United States Government assures the Government of Denmark that in
                            the exercise of its rights and duties in accordance with the provisions
                            of the agreement of April 27, 1951, concerning the defense of Greenland
                            it will not store nuclear weapons in Greenland or overfly Greenland with
                            aircraft carrying nuclear weapons without the consent of the Government
                            of Denmark.</p>

                            of April 27, 1951.</p>
                        <p>Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest

                        <p>I have the honor to state that the proposal contained in your note is

                        <p>On May 31, 1968, the Danish Ministry for Foreign Affairs released the
                            following statement: “As a result of the plane crash at
                            Thule, the Government instructed its Ambassador in Washington to raise
                            with the American Government the question of assurances that Danish
                            atomic policy as specified in the Folketing Resolution of February 8,
                            1968 is upheld in Greenland. In the discussions the Ambassador has
                            confirmed Danish atomic policy as expressed in the Folketing Resolution,
                            in accordance with which nuclear arms may not be stocked in Greenland
                            and the Greenland air territory may not be overflown with such weapons.
                            As previously reported, nuclear arms are not stocked in Greenland and
                            overflights with such weapons do not take place. The result of the
                            discussions in Washington creates harmony between the Defense Agreement
                            of 1951 and Danish atomic policy and therewith assurance under
                            international law, that this policy is respected in
                            Greenland.” (Telegram 5076 from Copenhagen, June 7; National

                            acceptable and that U.S. Government interests, as expressed during the
                            recent negotiations, had been taken into account in its preparation.

                        <p>3857. We appear to be heading for a confrontation with French on Cuban
                            trade. For Embassy to be effective in circumstances, we will need
                            clear-cut instructions on real US objectives. Following are
                            considerations bearing on such instructions:</p>
                        <p>1. Four Major Actual or Potential Issues Between US and French on Cuban
                            Trade:</p>
                        <p>A. French Credit Guarantees for Exports to Cuba. $10 million has already
                            been approved for trucks and tractors (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3832)<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">Dated February 11.

                            indications are there may be more. In particular we have no assurance
                            credit guarantees would not be issued for locomotives should request
                            again be made.</p>
                        <p>B. Request for information specific firms involved in Cuban trade and
                            their connections (based on <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>

                                (US))</note> we understand there is question whether French
                            performance can be considered satisfactory under amendment to Foreign
                            Assistance Act. Would appreciate information re application this
                            amendment to British situation.</p>
                        <p>D. If French performance on shipping or on general Cuban trade policy
                            judged inadequate, US may have to inform French Govt of termination aid.
                            While remaining US aid program is minimal (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0075"/>

                            especially coming on top of press attention already given to US-French
                            differences on Cuban trade.</p>
                        <p>2. French Position on Credit Guarantees for Cuban Trade:</p>
                        <p>A. Despite our best efforts here and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> (even officials
                            basically sympathetic to US position) not persuaded basic validity our
                            position. As <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> indicated
                                (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4008),<note n="8" xml:id="d25fn8">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_STR1">STR</gloss> 12-3 CUBA-FR)</note> French believe effort isolate
                            Cuba essentially governed by US domestic considerations; they tend to
                            doubt desirability, as well as practicality, of economic warfare against
                            Cuba. Hence their relatively cooperative attitude to date governed by
                            desire accommodate US rather than by any conviction of their own.</p>
                        <p>B. Until recently <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> (which has on
                            whole tried restrain French participation in Cuban trade and shipping)
                            has had upper hand. British bus deal, however, led to intensive
                            industrial pressures reflected through Industry and Finance Ministries.
                            In view British Govt action, and absence political conviction based on
                            French national interests, <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> has
                            been unwilling (and probably unable) in truck case to veto credit
                            guarantees on political grounds; same may apply to locomotives and other
                            upcoming deals.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> position until recently was
                            strengthened by technical consideration that Finance Ministry considered
                            Cuba bad debtor. It now appears (from Guindey, <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3804 and DeLattre, <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3833)<note n="9" xml:id="d25fn9">Telegram 3804 from Paris, February 6, reported French Foreign
                                Ministry views on the subject of trade with Cuba. Telegram 3833 from
                                Paris, February 11, reported that the French Government no longer
                                considered Cuba a debt risk. (Both ibid.)</note> that Cubans have
                            taken some action which removes this technical block.</p>
                        <p>D. Result is that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> position has been
                            shifting towards treating Cuba on same basis as any other country for
                            credit purposes (although strategic exports as defined <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list apparently still apply),
                            unless in any particular case FonOff exercises veto on political
                            grounds. In present atmosphere, however, <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> will have hard time using only argument they feel
                            they have—i.e. that such deals would displease US.</p>
                        <p>3. Sovereignty Issue. Problems described para 1B, C, and D above all
                            raise in different ways issue of French
                            “sovereignty” in face alleged US efforts to
                            enforce its own will on French Govt or private citizens by use of our
                            greater power. This is issue on which French always sensitive, but
                            particularly so in context Gaullist foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>A. French have already indicated (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3758)<note n="10" xml:id="d25fn10">Telegram 3758
                                from Paris reported that France would oppose as a matter of policy
                                contacts between U.S. representatives and French companies trading
                                with Cuba. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_STR1">STR</gloss> 12-3

                            directly with firms under French jurisdiction on <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0076"/>Cuban trade matters. In private
                            conversations, several French officials have mentioned (without
                            specifying) cases in which US officials have allegedly
                            “threatened” French companies with retaliation if
                            they engage in Cuban trade.</p>
                        <p>B. In same line, we already know (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3818)<note n="11" xml:id="d25fn11">Not printed.
                                (Ibid.)</note> French will give us negative answer to request for
                            information on American connections of firms engaged in Cuban trade.
                            Assume grounds will be professional secrecy, but reason will be to
                            protect French firms from danger of American
                            “sanctions.”</p>
                        <p>C. While French have not recently objected to US efforts to force French
                            shippers out of Cuban trade under Executive Order of Feb. 6, 1963,<note n="12" xml:id="d25fn12">Reference is to a White House announcement
                                that action would be taken to assure U.S. Government-financed
                                cargoes would not be shipped on foreign flag vessels trading with
                                Cuba. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 25, 1963, p. 283.</note> there is
                            little doubt that they resent these efforts and are liable to make this
                            point in any over-all approach they make to us. For same reason, we
                            doubt they will go much farther than they have in cooperating with us on
                            this subject. In particular, a written commitment such as suggested
                                <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 4004 seems almost out of
                            question.</p>
                        <p>D. As already indicated, cut-off of US aid under amendment to <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>, though amounts involved are very small
                            and effect on French policy nil, will provide easy basis for
                            dramatization accusation US attempting to treat France as
                            “colony;” Gaullist <hi rend="italic">La
                                Nation</hi> has already taken this line in commenting on US reaction
                            to recent announcement credit guarantees to Cuba. Tiny nature of
                            “stick” also likely be ridiculed by French and
                            European press.</p>
                        <p>4. Courses of Action. In this situation, we cannot in
                            Embassy's view expect to hold the line on French
                            participation in Cuban trade and shipping, as we have relative
                            successfully so far, by informal low-key, low-level dealings with
                            essentially sympathetic officials. We seem have choice between two
                            possible courses of action:</p>
                        <p>A. To pursue piecemeal effort to apply brakes on selective basis to
                            French actions which might be of particular importance in terms of Cuban
                            economy. This would require high-level approach to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, making clear we not attempting dictate policy to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> but asking them exercise maximum
                            restraint on Cuban matters in order avoid creating problem which could
                            aggravate already unfortunate state Franco-American relations. To
                            succeed in this approach, we would have to limit our objectives to
                            questions of real importance (e.g. locomotives) and be prepared abandon
                            any vigorous effort enforce our policy against private companies either
                            in shipping or non-shipping business. Possibility of success would be
                            much enhanced if we could <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0077"/>persuade British to modify their position; another vigorous effort in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to obtain multilateral support
                            for policy of restraint on Cuban trade would also contribute a great
                            deal.</p>
                        <p>B. Alternatively, we can make a more formal approach to French Govt,
                            asking for <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> refusal to grant credit
                            guarantees for Cuba, and full <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>
                            cooperation in preventing French shipping and other companies from
                            participating in Cuban trade. Such approach would be backed up by
                            straightforward implementation of amendment to <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>. In diplomatic terms, such approach would certainly be
                            a failure, as <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> under present
                            circumstances would not accept what they would interpret as US
                            “dictation.” We would, however, make a clear
                            record that we had done our best to stop Franco-Cuban trade. The price
                            would be a public issue on this subject between US and <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>, which will further exacerbate
                            US-French relations with possible broader impact on relations with other
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries, who might well accept
                            French lead on this particular issue.</p>
                        <p>5. Choice between these two courses of action depends essentially on
                            whether we are more interested in making a record or in limited
                            practical results on Cuban trade itself. In light considerations earlier
                            part this telegram there is no guarantee at all that first course (para
                            4A) would succeed; we can only find out by trying. If, however, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> judges it more essential we make
                            record, or if mandatory legislative provisions leave us no choice, then
                            we must choose course of action in 4B and do what we can to limit damage
                            to Franco-American relations.</p>

                            concentrate my remarks primarily on South Vietnam. I then made the
                            points raised in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> in regard to
                            ChiCom aims and policies in Southeast Asia; their attitude towards
                            neutralization and its relation to their policy of communization, and
                            fact that Hanoi had rejected any neutralization for Viet Minh. I then
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> if he would give me
                            frankly his own personal views on situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> began by saying that he
                            wished to assure me that there was no French plan whatsoever for
                            Southeast Asia other than those in operation for Laos and the plans for
                            Cambodia. He said he thought that the US was in full agreement with
                            France in regard to the neutralization of Laos and also for that of
                            Cambodia although he fully understood why we were not willing to join in
                            a conference to achieve the latter. His remarks therefore would deal
                            with Vietnam. He said he did not personally disagree with any remark
                            that I had made in regard to Chinese attitude.</p>
                        <p>He said that he thought there was perhaps a great deal of
                            misunderstanding between what he said was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s vague generalized remarks in regard
                            to neutralization which he said at best would take many years to come
                            into being, and what could be considered current French policy. He
                            repeated that there was no French plan to deal with the Vietnamese
                            situation. Looking at it however personally he said that he thought the
                            situation was very difficult insofar as the US was concerned. In his
                            personal view the trouble was not military but political; that with the
                            disappearance of Diem<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4"> Ngo Dinh Diem,
                                President of the Republic of South Vietnam, was killed in the
                                aftermath of the military coup of November 1-2, 1963.</note> who had
                            at least set up a government which although highly unpopular had
                            operated in a relatively <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0079"/>effective manner for the conduct of military operations, there was no
                            effective political force in South Vietnam and he personally did not see
                            much prospect for setting one up. He therefore thought that the US had
                            essentially two courses of action which it could follow: (1) To continue
                            along the present lines it was at present, which he frankly felt would
                            not be very successful, or (2) to increase military operations in South
                            Vietnam appreciably, coupled possibly at a certain point in the future
                            with a willingness to attempt some form of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my statement that intensified military operations would only
                            make sense if it involved a willingness to carry the war if necessary to
                            Hanoi, <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> answered that he
                            fully understood this and had it in mind when he spoke about the
                            increased military involvement. He repeated that these were merely
                            personal views but he felt that in order to have any prospect of any
                            settlement we would have to confront the Communists with a more
                            disagreeable alternative than negotiation. He said this was what in
                            effect had been done in Laos and why the Communists had accepted it. I
                            told him that this very much coincided with my view and understanding of
                            how Communists reacted but I could not of course speak for my government
                            as to whether large military operations would be feasible or not.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said he was very glad to
                            have this opportunity of discussing Vietnam with me and said he hoped it
                            would be continued. I mentioned the discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> today to which he replied that it
                            would have been quite impossible to have had a discussion such as ours
                            in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. I inquired whether it might not
                            be a good idea for Koren to stay over a day or so and discuss in more
                            detail the matter at the Quai d'Orsay, to which <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> replied that he thought that was
                            an excellent idea. Koren had planned to stay over one day in any event
                            and I would judge after tomorrow whether or not it would be necessary
                            for him to stay longer.</p>

                            I believe therefore that this conversation should be handled with

                        <p>This paper does not deal with domestic problems since <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has this situation very well
                            in hand and pending his decisions on elections, there should be no
                            change.</p>
                        <p>Fundamental and basic element in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s foreign policy is his strongly held
                            and unchangeable conviction that the nation (the state and not the
                            people) represents the permanent unit in international affairs. Its
                            authority and sovereignty must under no conditions be watered down or
                            weakened in any way. The conception of France as a nation is embued with
                            almost mystical quality and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> is embodiment of this national spirit (see first
                            page of his <hi rend="italic">War Memoires</hi>).</p>
                        <p>If this concept is fully understood almost all <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actions in
                            foreign affairs in last five years are logical, deductible, and quite
                            consistent. It explains <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s antagonism to the organization of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, his aversion to anything that smacks
                            of integration. It is the reason why he has withdrawn French fleet from
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> control and Air Force and two
                            French divisions. It is also national concept which has caused him to
                            refuse permission for storage of American atomic weapons on French
                            soil.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s conception
                            of nation in defense matters was well expressed in 1959 talk at French
                            Military Institute. His concept of alliance is old-fashioned 1914 type,
                            i.e., alliance operates only in times of crisis (war danger) but not in
                            interim periods. This explains his solidarity with United States and
                            Alliance at time of Berlin crisis and his support of United States in
                            Cuba. It should, however, be emphasized that support in time of crisis
                            when issue of war is present does not (repeat not) obtain in a
                            non-crisis period. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has
                            in effect withdrawn France from Alliance in political or diplomatic

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s conception
                            of the nation is particularly relevant when it applies to relations of a
                            middle-sized power (France) and a great power (United States). This
                            conception conditions all of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s attitudes towards United States and
                            forces him by its logic to take opposite position as matter of principle
                            because of his belief that too close association would cause France
                            automatically to become satellite. It is also explanation of force de
                            frappe which, in turn, logically requires distortion of postwar history
                            in order to justify current policy; for example, doubt as to United
                            States intentions in event of war must be spread by French propaganda in
                            order to justify heavy expenditures for force de frappe.</p>

                            with any other country was involved. Evidence would indicate that actual
                            discussions took place in Switzerland and that Edgar Faure's
                            role in this matter has been considerably exaggerated. It appears that
                            Chinese asked two conditions: a) French support in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and b) breach with Formosa. France
                            refused accept these conditions as formal conditions for recognition,
                            but it is very probable that Chinese were told sub rosa that they would
                            be met since French actions subsequent in both fields would appear to
                            bear this out. In addition, France possibly foresaw crisis in Vietnam
                            and wished France to be installed in Peking in order to take advantage
                            of crisis when it comes.</p>
                        <p>Four levels of opinion can be discerned in France:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Government, Ministers, Civil Servants, etc., of which I would say
                            ninety percent do not agree with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s conduct of foreign affairs and, on
                            the whole, are basically friendly to the United States.</p>
                        <p>3. Young Gaullists, UNR. These are irresponsible, unintelligent,
                            authoritarian-minded, and go farther than <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> in anti-American attitudes. Peyrefitte belongs to
                            this group and his conduct of French propaganda is clearly marked by
                            strong anti-American trend.</p>
                        <p>4. French people as a whole. Up to the present time, French people, on
                            balance, seem to have little anti-Americanism, but this is situation
                            that can, of course, change if current propaganda continues.</p>
                        <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>There would seem to be little chance of any change occurring for the
                            better as long as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is in
                            power. It is very doubtful if he wants anything from the United States
                            and more likely that he prefers a certain amount of friction. He is,
                            however, well aware of the fact that French survival is dependent on
                            American military protection. At the present time, he seems to have
                            forgotten about Europe and his major attention seems to be to so-called
                            “third world,” particularly South America. The
                            danger here is that he will start currents which will be stronger than
                            he anticipates. It is not clear whether he recognized the hard core
                            anti-American feeling in Latin America is Communist inspired, which
                            since 1944, has treated United States as public enemy number one.</p>
                        <p rend="center">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>It is always easier to say what should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be done
                            in regard to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> than what
                            should be done. For the purposes of elimination, I shall start with
                            attitudes or actions which I am convinced would be unwise to take in
                            regard to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. At the present moment, there seems to be no question of any meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. There would
                            appear to be no subjects that could be profitably discussed, and since
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will not come to
                            the United States and the President will not leave the country before
                            the elections, there is no possibility at least until the elections.</p>
                        <p>2. No concession or bribe of any kind will affect <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s attitude or
                            policies. He would regard any such gesture on our part as confirmation
                            of the correctness of his views and his just due without seeing any
                            necessity to change his position at all.</p>
                        <p>3. The only type of action which would affect <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s policy would be a fairly basic
                            change in circumstances in which these policies operate. However, it
                            appears obvious that any change in our European policy would affect
                            other Europeans equally if not more than France. For example, a shift in
                            our strategy which would threaten an important cutback in our troops in
                            Europe would be quite unacceptable to the Germans and even if threatened
                            for the sake of influencing France, would be most upsetting to the
                            Germans and plant suspicions which would continue. The same effect would
                            be produced on Italy and other European Allies who have, on the whole,
                            remained faithful to the United States. We should avoid pinpricks and
                            small actions which look as though they are based upon irritation or ill
                            temper. These could only help <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> without producing any change whatsoever in his
                            attitude or policies.</p>
                        <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>4. In any bilateral relationship with France, whether military or
                            scientific, we should make sure that the United States receives an
                            adequate quid pro quo for anything that it gives. In the psychological
                            and publicity field, we should avoid giving the appearance that all is
                            well with our relations and that the differences are merely superficial.
                            I would certainly not recommend we say the opposite, but I think that
                            whenever we apply soothing words (which however occasionally may be
                            necessary for United States public opinion) we should realize that these
                            are seized upon by de Gaullist publicity machines to support the
                            contention that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is on
                            the right track. My recommendation, wherever possible, is that there
                            should be no statement from leading officials—i.e., the
                            President or Secretary of State, dealing directly with our relations
                            with France. We should avoid taking the initiative in any statements,
                            and if reply to questions is necessary, it should, on the whole, be
                            confined to generalities which say very little one way or another.</p>
                        <p>5. We should keep under constant review the possibility of halting the
                            delivery of tanker aircraft in the event that French policies become
                            more blatantly hostile to our purposes or there is some single issue
                            which is given great publicity.</p>
                        <p>6. In regard to Europe, we should continue our advocacy, although not
                            stated too often, of our belief in and support for European unification
                            and for partnership with the United States.</p>
                        <p>7. In the economic field, we should continue to work for the Kennedy
                            Round, but we must be cognizant of the fact that in direct bilateral
                            economic relations, the United States is heavily favored. (United States
                            exports to France were up sixteen percent for a total of over nine
                            hundred million dollars. Imports in 1963 were down a few percentage.)
                            Since we enjoy a very profitable trade with France, this is not the
                            subject on which we can initiate any retaliation. The same, I would say,
                            goes for the financial questions.</p>
                        <p>8. We should, if asked, say we welcome French interest and involvement in
                            Latin America. At the same time, we should observe most carefully the
                            tone and substance of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s statement on his two visits insofar
                            as they deal with the United States and adjust our attitude
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>In short, there would appear to be very little that we can do to make
                            plain our displeasure with current French attitude; I think calmness and
                            attention to detail so that we do not go too far in the direction of
                            polite soothing remarks, avoiding the other extreme of petulant and
                            ill-tempered criticism. It should always be borne in mind that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> cannot have very many more
                            years of being in power, and the present indications are that a very
                            large portion of the objectionable features of current French policy
                            would disappear with his departure from power.</p>

                        <p>General Billotte was brought in to see the President on Monday afternoon
                            by Mr. Robert Anderson. General Billotte had sought this appointment on
                            the ground that he had a personal message from General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, and while the French
                            Ambassador initially tried to insert himself into the meeting, he
                            withdrew after a conversation with General Billotte, an episode which
                            suggests that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            did indeed authorize this private visit to the President by
                            Billotte.</p>
                        <p>General Billotte's assertion is that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> believes that the U.S. and
                            France should cooperate on smaller matters where cooperation is
                            possible, in the hope that this may lead onward toward understanding on
                            larger matters. General Billotte reported that he had told <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that French Defense officials
                            had been uncooperative in responding to American proposals for
                            cooperation in the manufacture of tanks. He said that he had General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            authorization to make a specific proposal and could give us assurance
                            that if the U.S. could accept it in principle, there would be no
                            obstacle at other levels of the French Government.</p>
                        <p>General Billotte's specific proposal is that the French AMX 13
                            and AMX 30 tanks should be licensed for production in the U.S. He
                            believed that U.S. production could be cheaper by about 25%, that U.S.
                            producers—specifically Chrysler—could shift very
                            promptly from their present line to the French tanks, and that the
                            French tanks are superior to our current line. General Billotte proposed
                            that about 80% of the full run of the production of these two tanks
                            should be American.</p>
                        <p>The second element in General Billotte's proposal is that
                            France should join the Un. <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>. and Germany
                            in the production of the battle tanks of the next generation. He
                            recognized that France had been asked to participate in this operation
                            before, and said that it had been a mistake for France to abandon this

                        <p>It was not wholly clear from this conversation whether these two
                            proposals were linked in General Billotte's mind or whether
                            they are separable.</p>
                        <p>We told General Billotte that we would be back in touch with France
                            promptly, and while he himself proposed that the discussion should be
                            pursued first with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>, the President has now decided that it is better
                            for you and the General to have a talk first.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">In an April 9 memorandum to Bundy, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported that he had met with Billotte the
                                previous afternoon and listened to his proposals. “I told
                                him we would be happy to discuss in detail how France might join
                                with the United States and Germany in the development of the next
                                main battle tank, and how a U.S. firm or firms might join with
                                French firms in the production and sale to foreign governments of
                                French armored vehicles.” Billotte responded he would

                        <p>It is the policy of this government to oppose the development of nuclear
                            forces by additional states, other than those whose forces would be
                            assigned as part of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear
                            force, targeted in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            plans and, except when supreme national interests were at stake, used
                            only for the defense purposes of the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Given current French policy, it continues to be in this
                            government's interest not to contribute to or assist in the
                            development of a French nuclear warhead capability or a French national
                            strategic nuclear delivery capacity. This includes exchanges of
                            information and technology between the governments, sale of equipment,
                            joint research and development activities, and exchanges between
                            industrial and commercial organizations, either directly or through
                            third parties, which would be reasonably likely to facilitate these
                            efforts by significantly affecting timing, quality or costs or would
                            identify the U.S. as a major supplier or collaborator. However, this
                            directive is not intended to restrict unduly full and useful cooperation
                            in non-strategic programs and activities.</p>
                        <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0087"/>
                        <p>Therefore, the President has directed that effective controls be
                            established immediately to assure that, to the extent feasible, the
                            assistance referred to above is not extended either intentionally or
                            unintentionally.</p>
                        <p>To this end, specific technical guidance is to be developed and issued at
                            the earliest possible time for the use of the agencies that control the
                            export of equipment and technology, including data exchange
                            arrangements. Responsibility for the development of such guidance, and
                            when necessary the revision of these guidances, will be vested in the
                            Departments of State and Defense, in consultation as appropriate with
                            the Department of Commerce, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                            National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Atomic Energy
                            Commission, and the Office of Science and Technology, and under the
                            leadership of the Department of State. The approved guidance documents
                            will be cleared at the White House and issued as technical appendices to
                            this National Security Action Memorandum. Necessary guidance will be
                            requested before specific commitments are made by any agency.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Following the questions distributed in advance of the meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Not found.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is trying to increase
                            his influence in world affairs. If one recognizes the assumptions behind
                            this statement, he is only implicitly intent on reducing our
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>(a) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s view of
                            Europe is incompatible with partnership with the U.S. as we understand
                            it, i.e., involving European integration and European dependence on the
                            U.S. His definition of Atlantic partnership is narrower than ours.</p>
                        <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0088"/>
                        <p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s view of
                            the world and France's role in it is based on this estimate
                            of a decline in the relevant power of the superpowers (U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>). The Sino-Soviet conflict does favor
                            his objectives, e.g., intra-European political maneuvering because it
                            increases the options open to France in world politics.</p>
                        <p>2. These motivations are reflected as follows:</p>
                        <p>—In Europe by emphasis on European interests and an
                            independence of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>—In Africa by “national” policies
                            pursuing French advantages in cultural and economic fields.</p>
                        <p>—In the Far East in obvious ways such as recognition of the
                            Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>—In Latin America somewhat similar to <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and by conceding that it is a natural U.S. sphere of
                            interest while believing that France can play a larger role than at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>3. It is difficult to distinguish between <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> and France and, specifically, some of
                            Deferre's objectives are shared with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. There would be no question
                            of reversing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s actions if Deferre came to power.</p>
                        <p>4. It is not feasible to attempt to isolate <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and would not be in our interest except if he
                            decided to go beyond the limits imposed by basic facts, e.g., in
                            U.S.-European relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Secretary</p>
                        <p>Looking at the events through which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has lived, it is easy to understand his hopes for
                            rebuilding France's prestige.</p>
                        <p>In the context of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s thinking, opportunities for France to
                            disagree with the U.S. are “positive pluses.”</p>
                        <p>We should not get excited and show too much public concern over
                            France's attempts at independence since this only helps
                            achieve France's aims.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>—Mr. Tasca </p>
                        <p>France's influence in Africa is on the whole favorable, yet
                            the French position is constantly eroding and has significant gaps (as
                            in Guinea).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> ARA—Mr. Adams </p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> hopes to build up the
                            French position in Latin America he was wrong to begin in Mexico because
                            French influence there is greater than anywhere else in Latin America.

                        <p>Bob Anderson telephoned this morning to say that on Friday night, just as
                            he was ready to leave Europe, he got a sudden invitation to call on
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on Saturday at
                            10 A.M. He of course postponed his return and made the visit, which
                            lasted about 45 minutes-one hour.</p>
                        <p>Anderson reports that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> was most cordial. He said he knew there had been
                            difficulty in communication between France and the United States, and
                            would very much like to see this situation improved. There were only two
                            great powers—the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—but other countries had their own rights
                            and interests, and he thought it important to have good communications.
                            He said that he did not get on well with President Kennedy, who seemed
                            to have a grand design of his own and was not in agreement with the
                            views of General <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0090"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. On the other hand, while he
                            had talked with you only 15 minutes in November,<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">A memorandum of their conversation is in <ref target="frus1961-63v12#d276">

                                    Document 276</ref>.</note> he had found it a most valuable
                            conversation and hoped to have a better understanding with you.</p>
                        <p>The General then asked Anderson whether you would value communication by
                            letter or by telephone, and Anderson said he particularly emphasized the
                            telephone. Anderson said that while he could not speak for you, he could
                            think of no reason why such communications would not be welcome.
                            Anderson asked <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> if there
                            was any particular substantive matter which he would like to discuss,
                            but the General replied that in frankness he was too tired and was not
                            yet caught up with immediate issues after his illness.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> underwent surgery
                                on April 17.</note> Nevertheless he did value such connection, and
                            while he expected to have differences with even the greatest of allies,
                            France would always hope for good communication and understanding with
                            her real friends like the United States.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting and before he left France, Anderson received a further
                            message from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s office giving him the
                            General's telephone number—Balzac 2000.</p>
                        <p>Bob's recommendation is that you should find a moment to make
                            a personal phone call to the General in the next day or so. All that we
                            need say is that we have had a report of this friendly talk, that we are
                            grateful for the General's kindness to Mr. Anderson, that we
                            certainly do welcome communication with him by letter and by telephone,
                            and that this phone call is simply for the purpose of wishing him
                            continued recovery and expressing the hope that we can indeed have such
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>I support Bob's recommendation with one addition. George
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is going to Paris this
                            week end and has already asked if he may call on General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, as he will be calling later
                            on Prime Minister Home. I think you might wish to mention the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> visit to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, and to say that if he is
                            feeling ready for such communication, we would be very glad if he could
                            have a frank talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> about the great problems both our countries face in
                            Southeast Asia.<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">No record of a telephone

                            Previous reporting also indicates French may be rethinking and modifying
                            their economic aid policies in Africa and elsewhere. Conceivably actions
                            could create dangerous vacuum that could be exploited by Bloc to grave
                            detriment whole Western position.</p>
                        <p>Modalities of troop withdrawals will have important bearing on effect
                            they have on African countries concerned, i.e. numbers and types of
                            units withdrawn, timing, and whether seconded officers and training
                            units remain with local forces. Withdrawal French forces has serious
                            political implications in terms of internal security and political
                            stability of present regimes. It will also have a distinct economic
                            impact quite apart from any possible changes in nature and level of
                            economic aid.</p>

                            ideological terms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> stressed that the
                            “Dumbbell” organization of the Atlantic is
                            indispensable despite the fact that there is little prospect of early
                            major movement forward. It was his view that both European and American
                            public opinion should be made aware of the long term prospects implicit
                            in the Atlantic partnership concept. He urged that we define more
                            clearly what the United States really means by partnership. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> wondered whether we had thought
                            through the implications of such an arrangement and whether we were
                            really ready to give up any U.S. sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>In speculating about the post-U.S. election period, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> noted the degree to which
                            President Kennedy had finally come to understand <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He was fearful that
                            President Johnson would not have the patience to undertake this task and
                            would probably not reach the point of appreciating the complexity of the
                            General. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> was convinced
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            obsession with French independence means that the General would be
                            totally unable to compromise on any significant element of policy. On
                            the other hand <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s personal and public politeness might very
                            well mislead President Johnson into mistaking <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0093"/>manners for substantial concessions. He felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might be prepared
                            to attempt a summit meeting but certainly not a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> summit meeting. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> also felt that the place in which the meeting was
                            held could become important.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> referred to correspondence
                            he had had from Mac Bundy<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> in which the latter had asked what could be done
                            in the context of our political campaign to meet criticism of the
                            deterioration of French-American relations. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s short answer to this was
                            “Nothing.”</p>
                        <p>He referred to the letter I had written him about the Atlantic
                            Parliamentary Assembly. He said he would be writing to us on Senator
                            Fulbright's proposal. His only doubt was how it would fit
                            into the concept of Atlantic partnership.</p>
                        <p>He said he was anxious to come to the United States shortly after
                            November 3. He felt this important in view of the speculation in France
                            about his own future.</p>

                        <p>1. The letter at Tab A<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">Tabs A, C, and D are
                                not printed.</note> from <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, sent you and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in copy, recommends
                            approval in two cases involving exports to France. It invites your
                            independent comment to the White House, because the issues involved are
                            of concern to both State and Defense. The decision on these cases will
                            be important in terms of clarifying the intent and future implementation
                            of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">

                        <p>2. One case involves a French request to purchase enriched <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 in accordance with terms of our 1959
                            agreement, made to assist France in developing its own nuclear submarine
                            propulsion plant, and under which we agreed to sell France up to 300
                            kilograms of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 for this purpose. We
                            have already provided 171 kilograms, and the present request is for an
                            additional 63. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> technical
                            analysis (Tab C) leads them to the conclusion that the 63 kilograms is
                            of no real significance to the program, and that to deny the request
                            will cause the French no more than minor inconvenience. This conclusion
                            seems to me unquestionably correct.</p>
                        <p>3. The other case involves a request to buy two computers, valued at
                            about $12,000,000. One is intended for installation in a French weapons
                            laboratory, the other in a civil establishment but with likely part-time
                            military use. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> conclusion here
                            also is that both computers will be of only marginal significance in
                            terms of assisting the French strategic effort. This conclusion is less
                            well supported and seems to me considerably more dubious than in the
                            case of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235.</p>
                        <p>4. There has been a strong difference of view between Defense and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> at staff level on the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 case, with Defense arguing against
                            granting the French request (Tab D). There is no comparable Defense
                            document in the computer case, but it is our understanding that the
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> itself (at Commission level) has
                            been seriously divided over this one, with Chairman <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> and Commissioners Tape and
                            Bunting favoring approval, the other two either opposed or reserved.</p>
                        <p>The device of the letter to Bundy was decided on by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> partly as a means simply of getting a
                            high-level decision on two cases of considerable precedent value in
                            terms of implementing <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294, partly
                            in the hope that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in commenting would in effect rule against the
                            line of thinking of those in Defense who produced the letter at Tab D.
                            The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has hoped strongly that you will
                            favor approval of the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 request. There
                            is apparently less urgency and therefore less immediate concern about
                            our position as regards the computers.</p>
                        <p>5. I have no hesitancy whatever in recommending that we support Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName>'s position
                            on the <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235 request. The technical
                            finding is well-supported, and the material would obviously be of little
                            or no real consequence to the French program. I see no benefit and
                            considerable potential harm in denying the request and thereby in French
                            eyes failing to live up to a government-to-government agreement.</p>
                        <p>As regards the computers, I am not convinced by the arguments in the
                            letter, and would like to know much more before recommending anything. I
                            therefore suggest a holding position on this.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mac:</p>
                        <p>I have received a copy of <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn
                                Seaborg</persName>'s letter to you of November 23, 1964,
                            which invites my comment on two cases involving exports to France.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">See <ref target="#d35">Document
                                35</ref>.</note> While the cases both require evaluation within the
                            terms of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294, I will comment on
                            them separately because somewhat different considerations are involved
                            in the two.</p>
                        <p>Let me first however state my understanding of the policy embodied in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294, as that policy bears on
                            France. For the purposes before us, I can perhaps best do this by
                            recalling that the policy has always had positive as well as negative
                            aspects. In negative terms, it was the intent of the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> that we take pains to deny to France
                            (1) whatever will significantly assist her in acquiring an independent
                            strategic nuclear capability, whether that capability be thought of in
                            terms of nuclear weapons or the means to deliver them or (2) whatever
                            will identify the U.S. as a major supplier or collaborator in the French
                            effort. In positive terms, it was the intent of the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> that we take equally great pains not
                            to deny to France things which would not so assist her, and that to the
                            extent possible we continue to cooperate with France as with any other
                            friend and ally. Finally, when <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294
                            was issued last April, it was not for the purpose of setting new policy,
                            but instead to clarify and re-affirm existent policy, with the aim of
                            furnishing the concerned Departments and agencies with an authoritative
                            expression of that policy to be used as a guide in their implementation
                            of it.</p>
                        <p>There have been numerous developments since last April in U.S.-French
                            relations and the world scene generally, not all of them favorable,
                            unfortunately. I do not however see in them anything to change the basic
                            evaluation given above, or to cause us on our own initiative to adopt a
                            more restrictive policy toward France in terms of implementing <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294.</p>
                        <p>As regards the pending French request for 63 kilograms of <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>-235, made under the 1959 Agreement for
                            Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes,<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">This
                                agreement was signed with France July 20, 1959. The text is
                                classified.</note> I have carefully considered the available
                            evidence. I accept the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> conclusion as
                            to the marginal importance to the French program <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0096"/>of the requested amount, and it seems
                            quite clear that U.S. denial of the request would cause the French only
                            minor technical inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>In political terms, on the other hand, the consequences of denial could
                            be very serious. We do have an agreement, made in 1959 in good faith. We
                            are already publicly associated with this particular program, by virtue
                            of the agreement made in accordance with U.S. law and regulations, and
                            by virtue of deliveries previously made under that agreement. To deny
                            the pending request could and probably would be viewed by the French
                            Government as reneging by the U.S. on a firm commitment, and in view of
                            the determination that must necessarily be made in event of denial, as a
                            deliberate U.S. intimation that France is no longer contributing to the
                            common defense.</p>
                        <p>As is only too obvious, we have a sufficiency of serious problems with
                            the French Government already. I do not believe it is in our basic
                            interest to add to the list by denying this request, or by delaying
                            further in deciding it. It has been pending since June, and to delay
                            much longer would be tantamount to refusal, since the French must
                            proceed within the next few weeks to take action of one kind or another.
                            I therefore urge a quick affirmative decision.</p>
                        <p>As regards the computer cases, there is no comparable political aspect,
                            of course, since no government-to-government agreement is involved, and
                            the issue is largely that of deciding whether the inhibiting effect on
                            the French program would be great enough to justify governmental
                            intervention in U.S.-French trading relationships by blocking the two
                            sales. This is not the sole issue, however, since an evaluation must be
                            made also of the extent to which providing either or both these
                            computers would identify the U.S. as a major supplier or collaborator in
                            the French weapons program. The whole matter is a complex and difficult
                            one, in which I would like to sort things out somewhat further before
                            putting a recommendation of any kind to you.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn Seaborg</persName>'s letter
                            of November 23, 1964<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> raises basic issues about that aspect
                            of U.S. policy against proliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery
                            systems which is represented by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>
                            294.</p>
                        <p>I cannot agree with the position taken by <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> on the export of certain advanced computers and
                            enriched U-235 to France. It suggests that <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 and over-all U.S. policy calls for the denial of
                            assistance to France only if each denial action involves an item of
                            equipment or technology that is in itself a controlling, critical or
                            essential item in the French program. This position, in my judgment, is
                            unrealistic and self-defeating if the U.S. seriously intends to follow
                            the intent of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 “not
                            to contribute or assist” in the development of national
                            nuclear capabilities.</p>
                        <p>We all recognize, of course, that France or any other technologically
                            advanced nation has the capability to develop nuclear weapons and
                            delivery systems, and that the impact of U.S. denial of equipment and
                            technology may in many cases not be determinative. Nevertheless, export
                            controls, as one of several means of carrying out the anti-proliferation
                            policy, will—by cumulative effect—retard, increase
                            the cost of, or discourage French and other national efforts. In my
                            judgment, therefore, the U.S. should be firm and consistent in denying
                            whatever would measurably assist the program of any nation that aspires
                            to a nuclear weapons capability, unless such assistance would be clearly
                            insignificant. The approach taken by the AEC would, I suggest,
                            unnecessarily weaken such an export control policy and make that policy
                            inconsistent with the over-all U.S. anti-proliferation objective.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Computer Cases.</hi> I disagree with the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> recommendation that export be
                            permitted. These computers are designed admirably for atomic research,
                            and provide greatly enhanced ability for development of French nuclear
                            weapons and strategic delivery systems (although they of course have
                            other uses). One computer, the IBM 360-92, will be the largest and most
                            advanced model ever produced. Its acquisition by France in about two
                            years certainly would be an important, though <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0098"/>perhaps not an immediately decisive factor in the
                            long-range French nuclear weapons effort. The CDC 3600, the second
                            computer, is one of the most advanced currently in use. Its proposed
                            delivery directly to a French nuclear weapons facility convinces me that
                            export should be denied.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that the U.S. deny the export of these computers
                            under <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 and export of any others
                            that would make a similar significant contribution to nuclear weapons or
                            delivery systems development. The only condition under which I would
                            agree to approve such items for export is a firm assurance by the French
                            Government that they would not be so used.</p>
                        <p>I have the following additional comments on the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> memorandum attached to <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Glenn Seaborg</persName>'s letter:</p>
                        <p>a. Paragraph C (Memo, p. 1) suggests that the advanced computers are not
                            absolutely required by the French, pointing to the fact that a U.S.
                            thermonuclear device was developed without such a computer capability.
                            This is true, but our first device was very awkward and heavy, weighing
                            42,000 lbs. The French can develop thermonuclear explosives of this type
                            without the very large advanced computers involved here, but they cannot
                            design a small deliverable warhead. We do not want to provide them the
                            ability in the next few years to reduce, say, a 10,000 lb thermonuclear
                            device to a missile warhead of 750 lbs. This difference is vital.</p>
                        <p>b. Paragraph C also highlights what most disturbs me about the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> view of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294. The question is not whether the French are <hi rend="italic">“dependent upon”</hi> the item
                            sought to be exported (i.e., “but for” securing
                            that item their program will founder), but rather whether the item will
                            significantly assist their program. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> apparently does not dispute that the computers involved
                            meet the latter standard. Indeed, both <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> today rely
                            heavily upon comparable equipment in U.S. nuclear weapons and delivery
                            system programs, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> military uses
                            being interchangeable with peaceful uses.</p>
                        <p>c. The acknowledgment in paragraph D that these computers would assist
                            the French program “after 1969” should in itself
                            be sufficient to require denial under <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294. Had the U.S. been foresighted enough to act more
                            energetically only a few years ago along the lines <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 now calls for, we might today be
                            confronted with far fewer problems stemming from French nuclear
                            proliferation.</p>
                        <p>d. The statement is made at page 2 that the French would construe denial
                            to mean that the U.S. is refusing “to cooperate with them in
                            an area of fundamental and unclassified technology.” Of
                            course, the computers are “unclassified” but they
                            will be used for highly classified nuclear weapons research programs,
                            and can provide a significantly improved base for strategic delivery
                            system development as well <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0099"/>(submarine hull design, missile performance simulation, etc.).
                            Admittedly, the French may be unhappy, and their reaction will be
                            understandable. This is a risk, and a predictable result of applying
                                <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294. The real issue is whether
                            or not the U.S. seriously intends to retard the French program, knowing
                            that they will disapprove of our actions. Moreover, I question whether
                            the French adverse reaction is not being stressed too much. They have
                            known of our anti-proliferation policy for some time now.</p>
                        <p>e. At page 2, an inordinate stress is placed on the dollar value of the
                            sales involved. The dollar value for export of the many, many types of
                            computers (about 150) not falling within <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 is far greater than the value of the small number
                            of types of advanced computers (about 12) comparable to those at issue
                            here. Obviously I do not oppose the export of the 150 other types which
                            have many research, industrial, and commercial applications (as well as
                            substantial utility in nuclear weapons programs). As a rough estimate,
                            these 150 other types comprise about 95% of the dollar value of the
                            total market.</p>
                        <p>f. The reference at page 2 to the Ferranti capability is probably
                            incorrect in part. Information from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> staff indicates that neither this U.K. firm, nor the
                            company to which it apparently recently sold its large-computer
                            production facilities (ICT), plans to produce a computer comparable to
                            the IBM 360-92. As a result, the largest computer developed or known to
                            be under development outside the U.S. has been estimated to have only
                            5%-15% of the capability of the 360-92. Even this limited capability may
                            be important enough to call for discussion with the source country
                            (U.K.) to influence it to withhold any such computers under an
                            anti-proliferation policy akin to our own. The results of such efforts
                            should not be prejudged.</p>
                        <p>g. I question the suggestion at page 2, third paragraph, that existing
                            French computer capability devoted to non-weapons research could be
                            harnessed to assist significantly their nuclear weapons effort, thereby
                            obviating the need for the advanced computers at issue. Pooling a number
                            of large computers does not provide a substitute for a single advanced
                            machine such as the IBM 360-92. Certain sophisticated problems of
                            extreme size and complexity do not lend themselves to piecemeal
                            solution; in other instances the time required for solution makes
                            pooling unrealistic. For the volume of work which could be processed,
                            scheduling and central programming would be quite difficult; there would
                            be inefficient fragmenting of many computing jobs; and the computer time
                            required for much of the necessary work would be increased. Further,
                            diverting existing French computers into the pool would starve other
                            segments of their industry. Even with this pooling effort, the French
                            nuclear weapons program would in all probability be held back; at least
                            it would not be speeded up, as it would be with the advanced computers
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> would permit to be exported.</p>

                            Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Atomic Energy). (A copy is

                            is basically that the export license should be denied because the

                        <p>For the above reasons, I reaffirm the stated <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> position in opposition to the export and would be most
                            disinclined to certify, as the 1959 Agreement requires, that the
                            transfer of enriched uranium to France at this time will promote, and
                            will not constitute an unreasonable risk to U.S. defense and security.
                            As Mr. Howard's letter of November 6 indicates, there are
                            adequate grounds under the 1959 Agreement to support denial.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the U-235 export, I note that the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> memorandum (page 4, paragraph D) cites
                            as a reason for favorable action the fact that denial would have only a
                            short-range (“limited to the next two years”)
                            effect. In the computer cases, the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                            spoke in favor of export because denial would have only a long-range
                            (post-1969) effect. Somewhat questionably both grounds are urged
                            concurrently in support of permitting the exports.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I am hopeful that the differences of interpretation which
                            the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> letter has usefully brought to
                            your attention regarding the computer and U-235 transactions can be
                            quickly resolved. This should eliminate a major obstacle to implementing
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 policy effectively.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began by extending his congratulations, which he said were
                            belated, for the successful Common Market negotiations in which Couve
                            had been involved, adding that they could now look forward to the
                            Kennedy Round. He remarked that the U.S. had considered it would be
                            helpful to urge the Germans on this matter and we had done so and it
                            possibly had been helpful.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> made a suitable
                            response.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had come to see Couve on the question of the
                            intentions of Hanoi which had been mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> the other day;<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported on this
                                discussion in telegram Secto 15 from Paris, December 15. (National
                                Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> FR-US)</note> French estimates of these intentions
                            seemed to be somewhat different from those which we attributed to
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> replied that, in the last
                            conversation, the Secretary had concentrated on North Vietnam. The
                            French, however, felt that, rather like the European satellites and the
                            Soviet Union, it was impossible to ignore China, although they recognize
                            that North Vietnam did not have the same interests as China since the
                            former wished to retain its independence. It was as if South Vietnam
                            wished to negotiate without the U.S. He said he did not know what we
                            wished to find out. He said their information was that there were
                            considerable economic difficulties in North Vietnam although it
                            constituted no threat to the stability of the Ho Chi Minh regime. This
                            had been confirmed in a conversation between the Cambodian Foreign
                            Minister and Seydoux in New York. The Foreign Minister had said that the
                            regime was very solid and enjoyed the support of the people, but that
                            from an economic point of view life was very drab. He also reported that
                            there seemed to be general expectation of a U.S. attack and that there
                            were machine guns, etc., on the roofs of the houses. It was the French
                            impression that the government <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0102"/>of
                            North Vietnam had no intention of taking over South Vietnam for at least
                            the next ten years and that its main objective at the present time was a
                            return to the '54 agreements. He did not deny their belief in
                            ultimate reunification.</p>
                        <p>The Cambodian Foreign Minister had remarked about the importance of
                            helping South Vietnam, if the fighting could be brought to an end, in
                            order to show a better system than Communism. <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said that he felt the North
                            Vietnamese were between two elements, the United States in the south and
                            the Chinese in the north, and did not wish to give in to either.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he did not believe that the North Vietnamese
                            could think that the south wanted to take over the north and that all
                            that was needed was for the north to stop the guerrilla action.</p>
                        <p>Couve replied there was no point of arguing as to who had begun the
                            present situation. He said the U.S. now had some 22,000 men in there and
                            the north was sending in guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that who began it and when was a point of
                            considerable importance.</p>
                        <p>Couve answered that there was a question as to whether the Viet Cong had
                            intervened because of U.S. takeover from the French in South Vietnam or
                            whether the U.S. had begun it following intervention by the Viet Cong.
                            He said he would not like to enter into this discussion. There were
                            psychological and reciprocal fears to be considered. The fact, however,
                            was that now a situation exists which could only be solved by
                            simultaneous disengagement, which they felt could only be brought about
                            by negotiation.</p>
                        <p>He said also the Chinese had no military combat forces in Vietnam, to
                            which the Secretary agreed, saying they only had some training troops
                            and forces along the border.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, turning to Laos, remarked that in yesterday's
                            conversation President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            had said that Souphanouvong had never questioned the status of Souvanna
                            Phouma as Prime Minister of Laos.<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">Reported in
                                telegram Secto 26 from Paris, December 16. (Ibid., Conference Files:
                                Lot 66 D 110, CF 2534)</note> According to our information this was
                            precisely what he had challenged for the purpose of going to a
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said that according to the
                            French understanding Souphanouvong accepted Souvanna Phouma as Prime
                            Minister but only in the sense that he was the chairman, as it were, of
                            the three factions in Laos. He added that if Souvanna Phouma were able
                            to be Prime Minister on his own, and if there were no three factions in
                            Laos there would be no Laotian problem.</p>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that it was one thing to say that the Prime
                            Minister required the concurrence of the three factions. It was another
                            thing when the writ of the Prime Minister does not run in Pathet Lao, as
                            has been the case in Laos since the entry into force of the present
                            government. Because of this there has been no possibility of controlling
                            the 6,000 Viet Minh and the use of Laos as a corridor to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said there were difficulties
                            on both sides of this question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not think that one could present the situation
                            in South Vietnam as though it was an evenly balanced affair with wrong
                            on both sides.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said they did not pretend it
                            was evenly balanced, but there were difficulties on both sides.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then remarked that agreement in Laos had never been
                            conditioned on the situation in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> agreed, but said the purpose
                            of the agreement was to keep Laos as calm as possible. In fact, however,
                            he recognized that Vietnam did have an effect on the Laotian situation.
                            He said in a sense the '62 agreement had been successful, but
                            now the war had begun again and the situation had returned to the
                            pre-Geneva stage with Souvanna Phouma in the same situation as General
                            Phoumi had been in 1961.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the position of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> was the result of direct fraud on the
                            part of the Russians. In Geneva it had been understood that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would, by two-thirds vote, have the
                            right to investigate developments in any region of the country. The
                            English wording implied that such a vote would be with the consent of
                            the Laotian Government, that is, with the consent already granted by the
                            Geneva Agreement. The French wording was somewhat less clear. This had
                            been pointed out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            to Pushkin, but Pushkin had confirmed the meaning of the English text.
                            However, in practice the Polish member had invoked the Pathet Lao veto
                            as a reason for not carrying out this agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> then inquired what could be
                            done in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            had suggested that they should see what the three Laotian factions could
                            do together, and he understood that Souvanna Phouma had proposed a
                            meeting in Laos but that he had not heard whether there had been an
                            answer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> agreed and said he
                            understood the meeting place suggested was Luang Prabang.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName>, in reply to a question, said
                            that there were still lower representatives of the Laotian factions in
                            Paris but there were no meetings.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said he agreed that the best
                            thing would be for them to meet and that he did not know about the
                            prospects.</p>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0104"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether or not they had had anything from
                            Hanoi on the subject of Laos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> replied they have not, but
                            pointed out that they had no real representatives in Hanoi, and there
                            was only a low-level trade delegation from Hanoi in Paris.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had had some indirect contacts with Hanoi but
                            there had been nothing serious.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that the North
                            Vietnamese would never tell us anything except to express their concern
                            for future American intentions. They could not say anything
                            constructive. They could only tell us to get out just the way we told
                            them to get out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that we have always said if they got out we would get
                            out.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said this is what they say,
                            but suppose both sides get out—what would then happen?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that with the Viet Cong out it would be much
                            easier for the South Vietnamese, and particularly the army, to organize
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said the French did not
                            agree and he did not think that ten or twelve generals squabbling among
                            themselves could organize the country with the Buddhists, the sects, and
                            the mountain people all in disagreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the absence of the Viet Cong would make it a new
                            and easier situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said this was true but it
                            would be impossible to foresee what would be the outcome. The present
                            rulers were old men and they were not bad but it was obvious that they
                            were not going to last. What was needed was time, with no fighting and
                            no foreign intervention. A national movement was needed. He added that
                            the French aim was to avoid a Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he had received that impression from his talk
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, who had
                            said that despite the consequences, even Communism, he preferred peace
                            in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said they should work to
                            avoid a Communist regime. He then inquired specifically what the U.S.
                            would like to find out from the North Vietnamese. Was it that we wished
                            South Vietnam to be independent and to stop interference from the
                            north?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied there were many complications, and that perhaps an
                            important indicator of Communist intentions would be the Laos Agreement
                            of 1962. It might be possible, for example, to inquire of Souphanouvong
                            exactly what his attitude was in regard to Souvanna Phouma as Prime
                            Minister at the conference, to which Couve agreed. He also wondered
                            whether it might not be possible to inquire as to the <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0105"/>reaction of Souphanouvong in regard to
                            the Polish proposal for a preliminary meeting attended by the two
                            co-chairmen, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, and the Government
                            of Laos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said it was not easy now,
                            but the Secretary said it might be possible to ascertain prospects of
                            success before proceeding to a formal conference and it might give the
                            Russians a chance to do something without the presence of the Chinese or
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> then asked if it would be
                            possible to say that the U.S. would be satisfied if Souphanouvong agreed
                            that Souvanna Phouma would be Prime Minister but, at the same time, on
                            the basis of an agreement of the three parties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this would depend on whether this meant that Souvanna
                            Phouma could only act as the Pathet Lao wished at the conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said this would seem to him
                            to be a matter of procedure, which the Laotians could agree among
                            themselves. He did recall how it had worked at the Geneva Conference in
                                1961-62.<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">Documentation on the Geneva
                                Conference on Laos is in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                                1961-1963, volume XXIV.</note> He asked what would happen if the
                            Russians or Chinese should refer to the U.S. or Thailand military
                            personnel in Laos at a conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that this would be quite all right with us. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could look at anything provided
                            it is not one-sided. The original agreement in '62 had
                            provided for elimination of all foreign troops except a certain number
                            of French. This had been our objective, and Couve agreed that it still
                            was.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> then said that under the
                            agreement the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had the right to
                            inspect, which the Secretary confirmed was by a two-thirds vote.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then suggested that it might be useful for the French to
                            make the contact with South Vietnam rather than Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Secretary suggested that the French might wish to make
                            a check on a number of North Vietnamese statements in 1959-60, which he
                            said had gone very far in calling for the conquest of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said he had always
                            understood that the position of the north had been to return to
                            '54 but that the statements referred to seemed to go
                            further.</p>

                        <p>3642. Following Secretary's departure and extensive
                            Franco-American conversations this week in which he participated,
                            following are Embassy's preliminary comment on results this
                            week's activities in Paris insofar as our relations with
                            France are concerned:</p>
                        <p>1) Secretary's extensive program of talks with French leaders
                            including two sessions with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">See <ref target="#d38fn3">footnote 3,

                            press argument to effect U.S. not maintaining dialogue with French.
                            Press and public opinion has alleged U.S. policies as well. This
                            argument has disappeared as of now, and we are in position take line
                            with French publicly and privately that every effort being made explain
                            in fullest detail our positions on outstanding issues to French. Couve
                            visit to Washington next month would further strengthen this
                            argument.</p>
                        <p>2) Press has also stressed that Secretary took position with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that neither <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> nor any other U.S. policy directed
                            against France or at French encirclement. This has likewise had helpful
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>3) Fact all talks were held in atmosphere cordiality likewise helpful in
                            refuting argument that U.S.-French relations acrimonious. This position
                            already refuted directly by Secretary and we will obviously continue
                            maintain this line here. French in their briefings on these talks also
                            apparently taking position that everything passed most cordially.</p>
                        <p>4) Positive results <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>-Messmer talk<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">No record

                            given considerable attention to conclusions that U.S. and France will
                            coordinate their independent nuclear forces. Although there is some
                            difference of opinion as to specifics of outcome of meeting, in general
                            it is interpreted as promising sign U.S.-French cooperation for future
                            even though it is realized this will not be immediate.</p>
                        <p>5) While there is general understanding that Franco-American differences
                            over <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss> not resolved and
                            indeed no negotiations as such occurred, there is, nevertheless, opinion

                            moment. Embassy has previously reported French apparent plan relax

                            Fundamental French attitudes have not changed (and some observers remain
                            very pessimistic) but events of past week have certainly served to

                                4)</note> the elements of a solution satisfactory to the United
                            States appeared regarding the method of gold payment in connection with
                            the forthcoming general increase of quotas in the International Monetary
                            Fund. The next day a detailed agreement was reached by the Deputies of
                            the Ministers which Mr. Roosa has reduced to writing and sent to his
                            colleagues for confirmation of their agreement. The essence of the
                            agreement is that arrangements will be made so that the United States
                            will not suffer any gold loss as a result of the increase in quotas
                            except for our own gold payment to the Fund. This payment is offset by
                            equivalent automatic drawing rights in the Fund so it does not reduce
                            our readily available reserves. If this agreement sticks, as it should,
                            the whole matter of quota increases should be settled within a month or
                            six weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. My bilateral talks with the French Finance Minister were not as
                            promising. After some delay he informed me, in a private meeting at <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0108"/>my apartment, that the French
                            government had turned down his suggestion to make a $342 million
                            prepayment of debt to the United States accompanied by a $150 million
                            purchase of gold. The government had decided it would make no prepayment
                            and no exceptional purchase of gold. However, in order to reduce their
                            excess holding of dollars, they would approximately double their regular
                            monthly taking of gold from the United States, increasing the figure to
                            about $65 million. The French Minister said that this matter could be
                            reviewed again in about six months in light of the situation at that
                            time, and that he would continue his efforts within the French
                            government to achieve agreement on a debt prepayment. It is most
                            important that knowledge of this French decision be held in complete
                            confidence in order to protect the French Finance Minister's
                            position. He has been, and continues to be, helpful and friendly in all
                            his dealings with the U.S.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum has been prepared in response to your recent request for
                            detailed information on denials under our policy of not assisting France
                            in her nuclear weapons effort, and on French probing of that policy.</p>
                        <p>In addressing the subject of U.S.-French nuclear relationships, it is
                            important to recall that neither General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> nor any other high-level French official has ever
                            specifically asked for U.S. Government cooperation with France in
                            achieving a nuclear weapons capability. <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0109"/>This is not to say that General de Gaulle is opposed to
                            such cooperation and would reject it if offered; it is only to say that
                            there has been no U.S.-French dialogue at any high political level which
                            could reasonably be termed a French request for help met with U.S.
                            denial.</p>
                        <p>Our policy vis-á-visthe French or any other independent
                            nuclear weapons effort has been expressed principally in general
                            statements made in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context or
                            elsewhere. The French have not overtly challenged or even discussed with
                            us this policy as such; their probing has come principally in the form
                            of requests to buy specific items of equipment or technology. The French
                            approach has been a pragmatic and generally quite honest and above-board
                            one, which could be described as follows: General de Gaulle has decided
                            that France should press on with an independent program, getting
                            whatever items of practical assistance may be needed and available, but
                            persisting with the program irrespective of the availability of this
                            assistance, and working toward self-sufficiency in all important
                            aspects.</p>
                        <p>The French officials responsible for implementing the program have of
                            course been well aware of the general U.S. policy and have not even
                            approached us with requests for direct weapons
                            assistance—warheads, design data, fissionable material for
                            weapons, etc. There have been many requests for marginal or contributory
                            assistance of various kinds, especially on the delivery vehicle as
                            contrasted to the warhead side of a national nuclear weapons capability.
                            In this connection, it should be noted that during the first few years
                            of the French program, we were comparatively more concerned with
                            controlling warhead assistance than delivery assistance, whereas we now
                            give close attention to both.</p>
                        <p>The attached annexes compiled by State's Office of Munitions
                            Control, and including contributions from the Department of Defense and
                            the three Services, furnish details on specific denials since 1958 of
                            items coming within the purview of the policy currently expressed by
                            <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">The annexes are not printed. <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No.

                            They show that there have
                            been denied to the French over the years in question a substantial
                            variety of hardware, information, and technological data.</p>
                        <p>The Atomic Energy Commission played an important contributory role in
                            many of these cases, and in others mentioned below which did not involve
                            direct denials. The <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has also denied
                            access to its facilities by French <gloss target="#t_CEA1">CEA</gloss>
                            representatives upon occasion. Records available at this time show 21
                            such <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> denials since 1961. Commerce
                            has played virtually no role in this area as yet, but is expected to do
                            so increasingly in the future because of our Test Ban Treaty
                                obligations.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">For text of the Nuclear Test

                            for export to France have been denied by Commerce. They were for boron
                            trifluoride, lithium, gallium, synthetic rubber products, and high-speed
                            camera parts. Both <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 294 and Test
                            Ban Treaty considerations were involved.</p>
                        <p>Study of the annexes will give a good over-view of the practical results
                            of our policy in terms of specific items the French sought and failed to
                            obtain from the U.S. in the 1958-64 period. In addition, it is useful to
                            summarize some key approach-response situations over the years, because
                            they give a flavor of French “probing” and U.S.
                            response, even though formal denials may not have been involved. It is
                            also useful to sketch the relationship to the problem of the Test Ban
                            Treaty, since it introduced a new factor into the situation.</p>

                        <p>French interest in nuclear propulsion for submarines antedates <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s return to power
                            and stems in part from a U.S. offer of general assistance in this field
                            made in the context of the 1957 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Heads of Government meeting, and thereafter repeated specifically to
                            France. Nothing came of this, for reasons of both a policy and security
                            nature, and the 1959 agreement under which we undertook to furnish fuel
                            for a land-based prototype reactor was a “consolation
                            prize” to the French, inasmuch as no U.S. technology is
                            involved, and the French are entirely on their own in developing the
                            reactor.</p>
                        <p>In late 1961, the French indicated to <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>
                            Chairman Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> an interest
                            in acquiring fuel for an operating submarine. Preliminary consideration
                            was given this matter within the U.S. Government and a decision was
                            reached in early 1962 that while it would be necessary to know more of
                            French plans before seriously addressing the subject, it would be
                            undesirable to engage in any detailed discussion with the French unless
                            and until we were prepared to imply that we might be willing to supply
                            fuel under some circumstances. This we were not willing to do, and this
                            particular French probe was therefore turned off with a
                            “no-response” tantamount to denial.</p>
                        <p>In 1962 an Administration spokesman indicated to the French that it might
                            be possible to sell them a nuclear submarine of the Skipjack
                            (hunter-killer) class, indicating at the same time that it would be
                            necessary to secure approval of the Congressional Joint Committee on
                            Atomic Energy. The French were definitely interested, and preliminary
                            discussions with JCAE had been held when the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> press conference of January 14, 1963 took

                            later, they were told that the events of January made it impracticable
                            to pursue the matter.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Gaseous Diffusion Plant</p>
                        <p>The French also expressed to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SGT1">Seaborg</persName> in 1961 an interest in acquiring unclassified
                            conventional equipment for use in their gaseous diffusion plant. They
                            were told that there would be no objection to their purchasing such
                            equipment from commercial suppliers, provided the sale and transfer
                            would not involve in any way the communication of Restricted Data.</p>
                        <p>The actual French shopping list when received called principally for
                            compressors and regulators, items of very considerable importance to the
                            operation of a gaseous diffusion plant. The final outcome was that while
                            a flat “no” was never given the French, a response
                            in early 1962 imposed conditions and qualifications of such a nature
                            that the French dropped the subject.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Request for Information on Joint Task Force 8</p>
                        <p>In 1963, on a Navy-to-Navy basis, the French requested information on the
                            detailed composition and methods of operation of Joint Task Force 8,
                            which had provided the logistic and instrumentation support for our
                            Pacific test operations in 1962. The French were candid in stating they
                            wanted the information because it would be helpful to their Navy in
                            participating in French nuclear tests.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. decision was that while complying with the request would
                            probably not mean giving the French any information of significance, to
                            comply fully would only encourage further and more difficult requests.
                            The response was, therefore, confined to referring the French Navy to
                            published information.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Observation of U.S. Underground Tests</p>
                        <p>In addition to routine requests for visits to <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> facilities which the French have made from time to
                            time, and which, as indicated above, have resulted in 21 turndowns over
                            the past few years, they asked to send observers to the 1962 weapons
                            test series in Nevada. Since access to the test site during operations
                            might have compromised weapons information, this request was not
                            granted. In response to a related inquiry, however, the French were told
                            that we did not propose to discontinue the practice of permitting sale
                            to France of unclassified instruments useful in weapons tests. (See
                            below for bearing on this position of Test Ban Treaty subsequently
                            concluded.)</p>

                            Lavaud submitted an extensive shopping list including items <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0112"/>of importance in guidance, propulsion,
                            and general design aspects of missile development. It was made known to
                            the French that these could not be considered favorably and this request
                            was not pushed. (The compressor-regulator order described above was also
                            connected with the Lavaud Mission.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Participation in Plutonium Effects Tests</p>
                        <p>In May, 1963 the French informally requested permission to participate in
                            plutonium effects tests at our Nevada Test Site. No response was given
                            and after the French learned that combined US-UK tests were in progress
                            they did not raise the matter again.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Test Ban Treaty</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of the Test Ban Treaty introduced a new factor into
                            U.S.-French nuclear relationships, particularly with respect to
                            furnishing equipment which might be used in French tests. After
                            consideration of our obligations under the Treaty, we provided the
                            French Government last February with the attached
                            Aide-Mémoire, expressing a U.S. intention to deny to France
                            any material, equipment or technology which would be used in the
                            devising, carrying out, or evaluation of tests, as long as France
                            contemplated conduct of tests in environments prohibited by the
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In October, 1964 an important test case was decided when Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> approved a recommendation
                            for denial of export of unclassified equipment intended for
                            instrumentation of French underground testing. This equipment was of a
                            type which the French had previously purchased with U.S. Government
                            knowledge and approval. Steps are now under way which will enable us to
                            bring our policy and intentions on export control under the Test Ban
                            Treaty to the attention of American manufacturers and exporters
                            generally, since some items may be involved which have not previously
                            been controlled by either State or Commerce.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary Evaluation</p>
                        <p>The policy currently expressed by <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss>
                            294 has in large part been in effect for several years. While the French
                            have never overtly challenged it, it is clear, from the cases sketched
                            above and from the detailed annexes, that they have extensively and
                            systematically probed U.S. implementation of that policy by attempting
                            to secure from U.S. sources a variety of hardware, information and
                            technological data that they presumably considered would be of value in
                            achieving their program goals.</p>
                        <p>Our denials have undoubtedly been troublesome to those charged with
                            carrying out the French program, and it is a reasonable assumption that
                            the cumulative effect of our denial policy has been to delay <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0113"/>attainment of program goals. It is also
                            a reasonable assumption that another effect has been to force an
                            increased degree of French self-sufficiency, given their intention,
                            which has so far prevailed, of carrying out the program irrespective of
                            the availability of outside assistance. These two offsetting factors
                            require careful assessment against a background evaluation of just where
                            the French stand in their program as of end-1964, in order to determine
                            those areas in which a U.S. denial policy can operate effectively
                            against French purposes in future.</p>

                        <p>3798. It occurred to me it might be useful at this time to give a summary
                            of available information concerning France's position on the
                            related subjects of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, nuclear
                            affairs, and the US position in Europe, which are of particular interest
                            to the United States. Other aspects of French policy, i.e. Southeast
                            Asia, Congo, and other questions not discussed here will be covered in a
                            subsequent message.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">Telegram 3858 from Paris,

                        <p>In most cases the information and analysis have been already submitted on
                            the separate subjects concerned, but it might help a general
                            understanding of current French policy if they were placed together as a
                            connected whole.</p>
                        <p>During 1964 certain aspects of French policy became more definite and
                            moved from the realm of speculation into that of quasi-certainty. In
                            cases where feasible I have endeavored to put down probable lines of
                            French action in relation to any given subject.</p>
                        <p>1. French Attitude Towards <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>During 1964 it became increasingly apparent that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s often repeated
                            desire to bring about structural changes in the North Atlantic <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0114"/>Treaty Organization—as
                            distinct from the Alliance—really involved a destruction of
                            the existing structural organization of the Treaty, including <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and all its varied functions, the
                            command structure, the assignment of forces, infrastructure, and in
                            short any aspect of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which
                            contained elements of integration. How and at what date this will be
                            done remains unseen and it is always possible that the distinction will
                            not be complete.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wants the Alliance
                            relationships probably in bilateral form after 1969. He apparently has
                            the old-fashioned idea that all that is required to make an alliance
                            effective in time of peace is occasional conversations with reciprocal
                            exchange of war plans between general staffs to go into effect in the
                            event of hostilities. This impression, which may seem exaggerated, is
                            based upon a number of conversations which I have had with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, or at which I have been
                            present when he has talked with the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>In part this view of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                            based upon his general historical analysis of the trends of events in
                            the future. He unquestionably believes that the Soviet menace will
                            progressively diminish, and that the sharp differences which exist in
                            the ideological and organizational field between Communist states of
                            Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union on the one hand and the
                            nations of Western Europe on the other, will tend to disappear. He
                            believes the danger of general warfare, that is war between major
                            powers, will not arise in Europe but will more likely occur in regard to
                            Communist China in Asia, but not for at least fifty years or so, unless
                            the US and China get out of hand in the Far East over Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does not plan to move in
                            this field in regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> until
                            close to the 1969 date when it is possible for any signatory to
                            withdraw. His apparent present intention is to hold down
                            France's participation in NATO to a minimum but in a formal
                            sense to let things go on until 1969 unless, as he has stated on a
                            number of occasions, there is a “crisis” or a
                            “drama” which would force him to consider earlier
                            action. In this connection, it should be noted that de Gaulle, in his
                            talk with the Secretary this December, referred to his memorandum of
                            September 1958<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">For text, see <ref target="frus1958-60v07p2">

                                    VII</ref>, Part 2, pp. 81-83.</note> as an attempt on his part
                            to bring about necessary changes in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which however met with no response. It can be deduced
                            from this that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s chief objection to the current structure
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is that it does not give ample
                            place to France and is too dominated in his eyes by the US.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, for the immediate future there is not much ground for
                            anticipating any sudden French move in regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> short of what <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0115"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> would call a crisis or a drama, terms which, when
                            he used them, he obviously meant to indicate a particular development
                            such as the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or even the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. Short of this he will undoubtedly wait
                            until (A) the French nuclear force is really operational and (B) until
                            close to 1969 North Atlantic Treaty date.</p>
                        <p>2. French Attitude Toward <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, or any Comparable Collective Nuclear
                            Project in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>French attitude on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> when it was
                            first broached some two years ago was very specific. The French said to
                            us on a number of occasions, and told the same to other members of the
                            Alliance, that France would not participate presumably because all of
                            its resources in this regard were fully utilized by its own Force de
                            Dissuasion, but it had no objection to the project as outlined nor any
                            objection to any other member of the Alliance participating.</p>
                        <p>In October 1964 this attitude changed radically. While the exact cause is
                            speculation, the French themselves tell us that initially they did not
                            believe that the idea would ever approach reality, but it is probable
                            that Erhard's press conference, and particularly his
                            reference to the possibility of a German-American bilateral arrangement
                            in this field, was what triggered off the new French opposition. The
                            first overt manifestations of the current French position were the
                            speech of <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> in
                            the National Assembly and the speeches of Pompidou to the parliamentary
                            journalists and to the Assembly. Pompidou gave considerable emphasis to
                            the bilateral aspects of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In any event, since about the end of October, French policy has hardened
                            into outright and open opposition to the whole concept of the
                            participation of any European allies with the US in a mixed-manned or
                            other joint nuclear venture in which the US would hold the crucial
                            control. At the moment of writing the exact future of the <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>, as it is now known, is not too clear.
                            Despite the amicable nature of the conversations the Secretary had in
                            Paris in December on the subject with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and with <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">See <ref target="#d38">Documents 38</ref> and <ref target="#d39">39</ref>.</note> French opposition remains just as
                            strong as it ever was and this opposition must be kept in mind in any
                            future plans for the atomic force. It does not in any sense mean that it
                            should be abandoned, but it merely means that French opposition cannot
                            be dismissed or ignored or expect to change, at least as long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is in power.</p>
                        <p>From the nature of the objections which the French have brought forward
                            to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> it would appear to me that
                            the real French objection is the recognition that any form of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (or outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) nuclear force in which some continental Europeans
                            would participate <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0116"/>would
                            inevitably do away with the French monopoly of European nuclear weapons
                            and would, in <hi rend="italic">de Gaulle</hi>'s view,
                            subject European defense to American veto and American control rather
                            than French. The French undoubtedly feel that given the difficulties
                            which the Germans would encounter (the WEU treaties, the lack of place
                            of test, shortage of raw material), France could easily retain in the
                            future under any circumstances the advance she has over Germany in this
                            field. Parenthetically it is probable that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> overestimates the value in peace time of a
                            monopoly of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>This central aim of French policy has rarely been enunciated and does not
                            figure among the public chief objections to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, but it is what lies behind the charge that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> is divisive. It is of course not in
                            reality divisive at all, since through the European clause the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> could become a purely European force if
                            and when Europe ever organized itself.</p>
                        <p>France will probably not take any action in this field unless the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> once again becomes a reality. It is,
                            however, extremely possible that the publicity attending the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> may well force France to take further
                            steps in the direction of European unification, or at least to make
                            certain gestures in that direction for the sake of appearance. It is
                            also probable that in any future discussion for the unification of
                            Europe, France, in accordance with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s Strasbourg speech, will insist upon
                            putting unification in the defense field on the agenda for immediate
                            discussion. It is not too difficult to imagine what use France would
                            make of any such agenda item for European discussion in the event that
                            any one of the members attempted to go in for the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. US Presence in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to much opinion <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            is not working to bring about any withdrawal of US forces from Europe in
                            the relatively near future. He does hopefully envisage over a long
                            period of time, according to his estimate of future international
                            trends, the emergence of a situation in Europe when US forces will no
                            longer be necessary for the defense of Europe. He is too realistic to
                            wish for any withdrawal too soon or too abruptly which might imperil
                            European security. What, however, he is trying to prevent is the
                            political or military institutionalization of US presence in Europe
                            after the military necessity has disappeared and consequently the forces
                            themselves withdrawn. This is the real basis for his often asserted
                            opposition in general to the present <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> structure and in part to his opposition to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or any other integrated nuclear
                            organization, including the US and some European countries.</p>
                        <p>But I repeat that at the present time, and for at least five years, there
                            would seem to be no possibility that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> would deliberately make any move designed to force
                            US withdrawal from Europe.</p>
                        <p>There is, particularly in the defense and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> field, a characteristic, logical sequence in French
                            policy quite independent of whether <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0117"/>or not the premise is sound. For example, once the
                            premise of the necessity of France having completely national nuclear
                            deterrent is accepted any logical consequences become apparent. For
                            example, it is necessary for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> periodically to voice doubts as to US intention to
                            use nuclear weapons with the risk of its own cities in the defense of
                            Europe. For if there were no question about American nuclear willingness
                            to defend Europe there would be no need for the Force de Dissuasion and
                            consequently no need for the financial burden on the French tax payers.
                            Also, the French strategy of immediate nuclear response of the so-called
                            trip wire theory is another logical consequence of the Force de Frappe.
                            Since France does not have the resources to spend on nuclear armament
                            and conventional forces, conventional forces have been and will be
                            further starved for funds. It follows that France would not be in a
                            position, even if it desired, to fight a conventional war on the soil of
                            Europe. While some of the foregoing considerations are obviously
                            speculative in character and cannot be exactly proven, I believe on the
                            other hand they provide a reasonably accurate account of current French
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>I would like to close this message by stating that I see no possibility
                            of any US diplomatic or political action directed specifically at France
                            which would significantly change French attitudes or policy in any of
                            these fields. Only external events, by changing basic circumstances,
                            might be expected to bring about serious modification of current French
                            attitude. While it is therefore unquestionably true that diplomacy has
                            very little chance of success in modifying France's
                            intransigent position, it is nevertheless in my opinion extremely
                            important that we should always hold out to the public the impression
                            that we believe that there is some hope in this regard since this would
                            permit us to maintain, as we have endeavored to do virtually ever since
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> came to power,
                            friendly relations without entertaining any naive hope of changing any
                            French basic positions. It is also very important to this to maintain
                            the current dialogue.</p>

                            being able to get away with few press conferences. He himself had held
                            forty-six of them, whereas President Kennedy had held twenty-one, and
                            yet he had been told that wasn't enough.</p>

                            just come back from Peiping. After the usual accusations against the
                            United States, he had said that the thing to do in Southeast Asia was to

                            exactly that he agreed, which would have been asking too much. However,
                            as the Ambassador left, Couve had summarized their talk according to his
                            own understanding, and had asked if the Ambassador objected to any part
                            of it, to which the Ambassador had replied in the negative. Couve said
                            that France had some commercial relations with North Vietnam but no
                            political relations, since France had diplomatic relations with South
                            Vietnam. He said the French government did not see any difference
                            between the North Vietnamese and the Chinese, except that the former are
                            more anxious to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The President said our information on what was happening in Southeast
                            Asia was limited. He said we did not have the best sources available. We
                            had always felt that in order to have useful negotiations, the other
                            side must want to negotiate. We had not seen any sign of this, in fact
                            our information reflected quite the contrary. (At this point the
                            President read several passages from an intelligence report on the
                            attitude of the North Vietnamese government which we had received
                            through a private source.)<note n="5" xml:id="d43fn5">Not found.</note>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said it was normal that
                            Hanoi should speak in this vein for propaganda purposes, but he did not
                            think that this was the real position.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in the last fourteen months he had watched
                            problems of concern to our allies very closely and very carefully, and
                            that he had always been very cautious and had taken care not to throw
                            our weight around. Illustrating his point with reference to an
                            occasional bean ball thrown in a baseball game, he said that when these
                            had come his way he had moved his head out of the line of fire and had
                            refused to engage in quarrels with people. He had always told our own
                            people that we didn't want to get into fights needlessly. The
                            President pointed out that President Eisenhower and President Kennedy
                            had told the people of South Vietnam that we wanted to help them help
                            themselves. This had always been our position and he wasn't
                            about to run out on our commitment. There were two or three thousand
                            incidents a month in South Vietnam and he didn't have to tell
                            the French what this meant as they had had plenty of experience out
                            there themselves. As the character of these incidents gets more serious
                            we respond in kind in order to make our purpose clear, e.g.: when the
                            North Vietnamese PT boats had been sent out against our destroyers, we
                            had bombed their bases on the North Vietnamese coast. We had also
                            shelled <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0120"/>the attacking craft with
                            our ships. Then the Viet Cong had been sent into a US compound and had
                            killed a number of our boys. The President was not going to write them a
                            thank-you note for this. There had been up to 78 such incidents. The
                            President wondered what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            or Erhard or <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> would do in
                            similar circumstances. What we had done was to bomb certain of their
                            staging and assembly points. Then the following night they had come and
                            blown up a hotel and killed some more of our soldiers. So our planes
                            went back and “sprinkled them a little.” The
                            President said he didn't think we had killed many of them. In
                            fact he thought that our action had probably caused more concern in
                            certain other parts of the world than it had in North Vietnam. The
                            President said that whenever <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> says something on the Vietnamese problem, the
                            President asks the Secretary of State or Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> to go and find out exactly what
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said. Then he is
                            told that the suggestion is that we ought to have a political solution.
                            The President said that he was all in favor of this but the question was
                            how to bring it about. The President said that the press would like him
                            to talk more than he does but he didn't want to. He noticed
                            that some of his colleagues talked to the press and he could tell which
                            ones had done so from little lines here and there in the articles. The
                            President repeated that our policy was to help the people of South
                            Vietnam to help themselves. We would leave tomorrow if anyone would
                            provide effective guarantees of the independence of South Vietnam. He
                            said we would pull our men out tonight if we could achieve this. The
                            President said that we were not going to give the other side a
                            privileged sanctuary as in Korea, or tell them what weapons we would use
                            or not use against them. We were going to keep them guessing and use
                            appropriate means in response to their aggression. We don't
                            want to move to escalation, but if the others do it, we will do whatever
                            is required on the basis of the wisest military judgment. We would like
                            to have everybody else's help in our efforts and we
                            haven't had much help from others. The President said that he
                            had greatly valued President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s stand and help at the time of the
                            Cuba crisis, and he had taken it into account in our relations with
                            France. He said that until we get support we will never be able to
                            explain our alliances satisfactorily to the American people. He said
                            that we might have to leave South Vietnam for some reason but we hoped
                            not. We welcomed the help and the counsel of everyone. If the North
                            Vietnamese think that they hold all the trump cards and that they have
                            the backing of world opinion, then they are misjudging the situation and
                            us, just like Hitler and the Japanese misjudged us. We have no
                            ambitions, but if we were to abandon Vietnam, we would be forced to give
                            up Laos, Thailand, Burma, and would be back to Hawaii and San Francisco.
                            He said that we ask for nothing for ourselves in Vietnam, we just want
                            the Vietminh to leave South Vietnam alone. The President said we wanted
                            a <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0121"/>solution, and we would rather
                            have a solution than the death of a single American or Vietnamese. The
                            President said that when people talk about a political solution they
                            always seem to come back to the thought that we haven't used
                            our strength properly. The President said that we intended to stay out
                            there as long as necessary and we didn't see what other
                            courses we could follow. He said that we would continue to exercise
                            prayer and caution, “waiting, praying and hoping that others
                            more experienced than ourselves could come up with some good
                            ideas.” The President said that he had not been too sensitive
                            to demands for stronger action from people in this country. In this
                            connection he specifically mentioned Goldwater, Nixon, Scranton,
                            Rockefeller and Lodge, who had all asked for greater military
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he fully understood the feelings expressed by
                            the President. The essential problem was: how to get out. He felt that
                            there was a complete contradiction between our respective information on
                            the thinking of the Chinese and North Vietnamese. The French
                            Government's information differed from ours. </p>
                        <p>The President said he had heard that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> says what we ought to do. He said de Gaulle is
                            a great man, and that we are grateful that there are not as many changes
                            of government in France as in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The
                            President said he would like to hear from him what he thinks we ought to
                            do, with points a., b., c.</p>
                        <p>(At this point there was some comment by the President on what General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> really recommended
                            with regard to the use of strength. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> explained this point to the
                            President.)</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the statement which the President had read
                            was pure propaganda, and was too stupid.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said the French government believed in a political
                            solution. According to its information, the other side wants to
                            negotiate. On the other hand, US information is that they
                            don't.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy asked whether the position of the other side was that the
                            United States should withdraw first and then negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied in the negative. He said that US withdrawal
                            was their ultimate objective, but they said that we should all go back
                            to the 1954 Geneva agreements first, in order to negotiate. They did not
                            ask for withdrawal as the first step. The Foreign Minister said that the
                            role of the Chicoms was far more important than that of the DRV.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it was the feeling of the Foreign Minister that if
                            we got an agreement it would be worth anything.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister answered that the most important factor was what
                            kind of a government there would be in South Vietnam. He admitted that
                            this was a risk which one would probably have to take. It was not
                            possible to tell what the nature of a South Vietnamese government would
                            be.</p>
                        <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0122"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked whether France felt
                            that any government likely to emerge would be dominated by Hanoi. </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that nobody could say.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> interjected that
                            Belgrade was not Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to the problem
                            of the other states in the general area of Southeast Asia: Laos,
                            Thailand, Burma, Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>The President said that success by the Chinese would be likely to
                            increase their appetite.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the main issue was the question of
                            relations between the United States and China. China could not fail to
                            be impressed by the immense power of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to his talk with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on June 5,
                                1964.<note n="6" xml:id="d43fn6">See <ref target="#d32fn4">footnote
                                    4, Document 32</ref>.</note> He thought that a major difference
                            between our two governments was in our respective assessment of the
                            intentions of Communist China. France thought that it was preoccupied
                            with major internal problems and thus looked inward on itself, whereas
                            we think that the Chinese are aggressive and land hungry.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy said that another difference was that France seems to think
                            that there can be no solution to the problem of stable government in
                            South Vietnam while the United States remains there, while we think that
                            there can be no solution if we leave.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that government stability was impossible to
                            achieve in a period of hostilities, but that if a cease fire could be
                            achieved, then, with the US staying in South Vietnam, internal
                            conditions could be expected to change.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> commented that
                            another difference was that France thinks that negotiations would last a
                            very long time, whereas we thought that a conference would be likely to
                            break up. </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that in estimating the probable course which
                            the Communist Chinese government would take, it was useful to look at
                            the Soviet example. He recalled that the Soviet Union had stayed quiet
                            until World War II and had only started its expansionist policies at
                            that time. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that Chinese
                            expansionism had already been active in Africa. The Foreign Minister
                            said this was different: before the war there had been activity in other
                            countries by the Communist parties. </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> said that
                            Communist China proclaimed its belief in militant support of indigenous
                            movements, and that this raised the question of how it could be expected
                            to retreat.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that if the Chinese once agreed to come to the
                            negotiating table, it would then be harder for them to resume
                            fighting.</p>

                        <p>The President asked what was the French evaluation of the Soviet thinking
                            on these matters.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister answered that the Russians had the same evaluation
                            as the French, and that they constituted a moderating element. The
                            Russians didn't want to see the Communist Chinese expand, and
                            would support North Vietnam against China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy said that unless the President had any special subject he
                            wanted to raise, he thought there was nothing in particular to be
                            discussed further except perhaps the question of gold. He said the
                            Foreign Minister was one of the few friends gold has, to which the
                            Foreign Minister rejoined: “Except for those who own
                            gold.”</p>
                        <p>There was some mention of the President's session yesterday

                            suasion would succeed. </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that if the President succeeded, this would be
                            a great achievement.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he personally had his own doubts about
                            success.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that after all the United States was a very
                            wealthy country.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the current dock strike which was still tying
                            up some of our southern ports. He said that New York and Baltimore and
                            Philadelphia were free again but that the Japanese were now buying grain
                            from Red China while our own grain was lying on the piers in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister mentioned some sales to Japan by Australia and New
                            Zealand, and some by France. In conclusion, the question of press
                            guidance was discussed, and it was agreed that the Foreign Minister
                            would say that he had talked about various subjects with the President,
                            including South Vietnam. The Foreign Minister said that in reply to any
                            further questions he would refer the press to the White House.</p>

                        <p>I thought you might like to have a record of my luncheon conversation
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, although nothing
                            very startling occurred.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Treatment of France.</hi> McNamara completely agreed
                            with me that the decision in regard to the supplying of U-235 to France
                            was not a question of the agreement per se, but was a policy decision
                            which could interpret the agreement in the desired light. He also agreed
                            that what we were talking about affected basic policy towards France and
                            that there should not be a refusal of the U-235 except in connection
                            with a basic examination of our attitude towards France. We speculated
                            somewhat on the possibility of utilizing the U-235 question as a means
                            for inducing France to accept some of the expeditions, particularly the
                            Gemini recovery unit in the Pacific, which the French had turned down. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that if this were
                            to be done, it should be done very subtly and at a relatively low level,
                            since <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was notoriously
                            adverse to any attempts to use direct pressure on him.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, John McNaughton, whom I saw over there before lunch with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, said that he stood
                            one hundred percent for refusal to the French of the U-235 on the
                            grounds that he was completely opposed to giving any material or
                            information to any country which would help it develop nuclear strategic
                            capability. He said his position was based on the desire to prevent the
                            spread of nuclear weapons. He also told me, in reply to my question,
                            that he was in favor of changing the McMahon Act<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">The McMahon Act, P.L. 585, formally the Atomic
                                Energy Act of 1946, approved August 1, 1946, forbade all exchange of
                                atomic energy information with other nations, even in areas having
                                no perceptible military bearing. (60 Stat. 755)</note> so as to
                            exclude Great Britain in the future. When I asked him how he thought
                            that would prevent the Chinese, or, conceivably the Indians, he admitted
                            that he didn't see how it would, but insisted on his main
                            position.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Strategy</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with me that there was really very
                            little substance to the difference in French and American strategy but
                            agreed that the French would certainly try and utilize this to prevent
                                <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0125"/>certain <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> exercises on its soil, asserting,
                            however, that what she was defending was previous <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy from amendment or change. I
                            told <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that I could only
                            see three contingencies in Europe on which the issue of conventional
                            forces versus nuclear were derived:</p>
                        <p>a) Berlin</p>
                        <p>b) A revolt in East Germany or other Communist country in Europe</p>
                        <p>c) A Communist coup or revolt in a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I said that aside from these, I could not agree that the Soviets would
                            contemplate an invasion of Western Europe without having first taken us
                            out or attempted to in a nuclear strike. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> seemed to agree with me but said that he
                            thought that the three contingencies I had mentioned were sufficient to
                            justify the development of a strategy, as he saw it. I told him that
                            while I had always understood that his strategy would not refuse to use
                            nuclear weapons in the event that this became necessary to protect
                            Europe, to which he agreed, it had nevertheless been interpreted in
                            Europe and exploited by de Gaulle as an indication of American
                            reluctance to risk her cities to the defense of Europe. I told him that
                            I thought that a clarification from some authentic American voice might
                            be worthwhile considering for the future. I merely submit this
                            memorandum for the record in case the subject comes up in my
                            absence.</p>

                        <p>5144. Three weeks after Foreign Minister's return from US, it
                            might be worthwhile take stock present status US-French relations as
                            seen from here. Unfortunately despite all-out effort which was made in
                            Washington to discuss matters in fullest spirit friendship with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>, French Government has
                            not behaved in fashion befitting an old ally in recent weeks and there
                            are abundant signs both latent and apparent of stress in our official
                            relations.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>In view its role as number one topic among our foreign problems, Vietnam
                            has held special significance in our relations with France recently. We
                            will not repeat here abundant evidences of Franco-American differences
                            on Vietnam as these have been repeatedly reported by Embassy.
                            Furthermore it is not so much fact French policy differs from ours that
                            causes us concern but particularly exasperating way in which French keep
                            reiterating their call for an international conference without
                            preconditions and apparently deliberately misunderstanding our
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that within matter of hours following
                            Couve's return from US on February 24 Information Minister
                            Peyrefitte issued call for Franco-Soviet “concert”
                            of policy on Vietnam. On subject Franco-Soviet relations incidentally
                            Paris is, of course, full of rumors of impending closer ties between two
                            continental states whose interests parallel in some instances (see
                            Embassy Airgram 2008, March 10, 1965).<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Not

                            evidence of any sharp alteration in these relations except appointment
                            Zorin to Paris seems indicate tendency on part Soviets get French to
                            “put up or shut up” particularly on European and
                            German matters and to some extent responds to French nibbles.</p>
                        <p>Effect of French attitudes towards Soviets inevitably has repercussions
                            on relation with US and impression is widespread in Paris that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> policy towards Soviets
                            intended annoy US as much as anything. Embassy does not believe
                            situation calls for alarm on our part or indeed any special notice of
                            French flirtation with East at all beyond occasional reminders this is
                            not passing unnoticed, especially since French do not seem to be getting
                            anywhere. However, indubitably impression is left here that de Gaulle
                            policy of increasing independence from US is furthered by recent
                            developments in French policy towards Soviet Union. Thus net effect
                            despite fact French have made relatively little headway is to give
                            impression further deterioration US-French relations.</p>

                        <p>In other European fields our relations with French less tense. French
                            have retreated from de Gaulle press conference implication that US (and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) should not be concerned with
                            German problem. This is probably tactical move however and appointment

                            encouraging noises made at Rambouillet by de Gaulle, French do not
                            intend to take initiative on tentative agreements reached there towards
                            calling series of meetings at high levels during spring and summer to

                            we have here is to effect French, while ostensibly ready to listen to

                            totally erroneous impression. Curiously enough atmosphere and attitudes
                            French public generally appears more friendly than during difficult days
                            of Fourth Republic through which France passed. Present French outlook
                            seems one of self-confidence and self-reliance (partially of course
                            caused by Fifth Republic) in which dependence on US has disappeared. As
                            result anti-American attitudes among French public seem to have waned,
                            perhaps partially as reaction to Gaullist policies. Difficulties
                            reported above are almost entirely on government-to-government level and

                            finally it should not be concluded that our problems with France are
                            nearer to solution because French public remains almost entirely
                            friendly to US. </p>

                            realities of Franco-Soviet relations. Neither side can go very far
                            without creating unpredictable and dangerous consequences to their rear:
                            for the Soviets, too much truck with Gaullist ideas about
                            “greater” Europe could have unsettling influence
                            on Soviet position in Eastern Europe; for the French there are the
                            obvious dangers of undermining French influence in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and French leading position in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. We therefore think that talk about
                            reversal of alliances and a Franco-Soviet “deal,”
                            prevalent in much opposition press speculation, seriously misses the

                            they can get French to accept language more favorable to GDR than

                            believe, however, that French are fully aware of possible adverse
                            consequences this might have in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,

                            visit:</p>
                        <p>1) Germany. The French have made no effort to disguise that Western
                            security and/or Germany will be main item on agenda. From <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s standpoint, it
                            would be risky to jettison all prospects for his continued popularity
                            with certain sectors of German opinion by overt indications of his
                            presumed desire to see Germany indefinitely divided. However, his Feb 4
                            press conference placed German reunification in realm of distant future
                            where this could be acceptable to Germany's eastern as well
                            as western neighbors. Numerous statements recently made on formal
                            occasions by Ambassadors Vinogradov and Zorin here in Paris to effect
                            that France and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are primarily
                            responsible for European security, and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s happy acquiescence of this echo to
                            his own thesis, suggest this may constitute basis for expressing
                            “common views” or “mutual
                            interest” in joint communiquéwhich doubtlessly
                            will be issued. Absence or tardiness of public concern in German
                            quarters (at least as far as we can judge from here) over implications
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s Feb 4
                            press conference, would, we would imagine, encourage <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to pursue theme that German
                            reunification is exclusively concern of European countries, rather than
                            matter also primarily affecting US or even <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. On other hand Quai publicly denied any French intention
                            depart from quadripartite responsibility for settling German problem
                            after Feb 4 press conference and same assurance was given to Secretary
                            by Couve during latter's visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>2) Vietnam. Here seems to be even less basis for genuine dialogue,
                            despite previous French expressions of readiness to concert policy with
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to end hostilities. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> doubtless would be
                            delighted to claim or jointly share with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> credit for moves leading to an international
                            settlement over Vietnam or better yet a “great
                            power” concord on Southeast Asia, this vision of glory
                            apparently has shrunk as events have escalated far beyond the possible
                            diplomatic impact of communiqués issued by MinInfo Peyrefitte
                            after Elysee Council of Ministers' meetings. Nevertheless, it
                            possible that Kremlin and Elysee will try to agree on some vague
                            language expressing desire for a negotiated
                            settlement—fuzzing over issue of what conditions, if any,
                            should precede them. On this matter Russians also operate under obvious
                            limits imposed by other members of socialist camp.</p>
                        <p>3) Eastern Europe. Although it safe bet that future status of Eastern
                            Europe will be omitted from communiqué, and probably even
                            from forthright private discussion, this problem will remain in
                            background as reminder of wide gulf that really exists between France
                            and Russia regarding Western security. Sore point with Communists, which
                            we sensed from Soviet diplomats here and which has been strongly
                            registered <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0131"/>by French Communists,
                            is Gaullist theme that Eastern European countries, not to mention <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, must “evolve”
                            out of Communism to merit inclusion in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s “enlarged
                            Europe.” Such evolution is quite fundamental to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s concept of a
                            Europe free from US “hegemony.” Although former
                            Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov apparently succeeded in getting some
                            influential French circles to believe that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has changed sufficiently to permit early consideration
                            of Franco-Soviet cooperation in place of France's present
                            reliance on its Western allies for security, we doubt that when it comes
                            down to discussing brass tacks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Zorin, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                        <p>One related but not unimportant factor which may also influence de Gaulle
                            in his flirtation with Soviets is effect which ostensible rapprochement
                            with Soviet Union may have on French Communist Party in connection with
                            presidential election this December. De Gaulle undoubtedly hopes that
                            some <gloss target="#t_PCF1">PCF</gloss> voters will vote for him (or
                            his heir) and partial justification for such vote could be provided

                        <p>6237. Germany and Europe: I told General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> that I thought some clarification from him as to
                            what particular differences he saw between France and the United States
                            in regard to Europe might be useful if he would give them to me. He
                            immediately said that he did not think that our differences were really
                            very much a matter of principle; he thought more a matter of time and he
                            emphasized in this connection that when he said reunification of Germany
                            would result from the evolution of Europe he did not in any sense
                            envisage that the U.S. would not participate in and be a party to any
                            final arrangements for <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0132"/>the
                            unification of Germany. He did think however that any unification would
                            require the consent of the neighboring states as to frontiers, which was
                            obvious, and also, he felt, a prior agreement somewhat like the Paris
                            Agreements in regard to the prohibition of nuclear weapons. He said in
                            this connection Germany lost the war and should be expected to pay for
                            it.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of Europe he made the interesting comment or charge that
                            the other members of the Six, Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium,
                            Luxembourg, were not in favor of the unification of Europe because it
                            was very convenient for them to have America assure their security and
                            conduct their foreign policy. I told de Gaulle that I had understood
                            that the Germans in particular were pressing for action in regard to
                            European unification, which he dismissed with a wave of his hand on the
                            ground that Erhard was in an election year and would make these gestures
                            but really didn't mean them very much.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> however did not seem

                            tell him that this had no relation to reality whatsoever and that the

                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said he thought he would

                            to which I replied that the General knew full well that I had been at
                            Yalta and I felt it would do no good.</p>
                        <p>Further on in the conversation I told <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> that I was really concerned that the current line
                            of French policy would begin to have a very serious effect on American
                            public opinion as distinct from the government. I said that when there
                            was military action and losses began to come in the people who had lost
                            a son, brother or other relative would not go into the nuances of
                            political positions but would simply ask the question who was with us
                            and who against.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName> said he realized the danger
                            on this score and said he understood the particular role of public
                            opinion in foreign relations and execution of American policy. He made
                            no offer, and I did not seek any, to do anything about this but I do
                            believe the thought was registered with him.</p>

                            “poor relations between France and America are a figment of
                            the journalists in both Washington and Paris.” He says that
                            among the people, outside Government, he finds no anti-American
                            sentiment in France and little other than pro-France sentiment among
                            Americans. “All of this,” he says, “is
                            salon talk among a limited number of people in or on the fringes of our
                            Governments.”</p>

                            when we are needed. The average Frenchman knows this, just as the
                            average American knows it. Your President is being misrepresented by his

                            either country. The journalists want to keep alive the fight that was

                                return to the gold standard, or the delegation of monetary policy to
                                an international agency. A summary of his remarks is in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, June 2, 1965.</note> If
                            you will read it carefully, he is only saying that the Western countries
                            should look at the international monetary situation and its problems and
                            do some things about that which have not been done all through these
                            post-war years. What Mr. Martin says—if you forget his
                            remarks about 1929—is only the same thing that General
                            DeGaulle and Mr. Rueff have been saying too. When General DeGaulle talks
                            about gold standards, he doesn't have a Council of Economic
                            Advisors guiding him on what he says—he just has Mr. Rueff.
                            The General does not know much about gold or international monetary
                            matters. What he has asked for, I believe, is not a return to the Gold
                            Standard as much as he has asked the allies to look for a better
                            standard than what we have now. I think many people in your Government
                            feel the same way, although they would not follow the same way that
                            General DeGaulle suggests. President Johnson has a fine opportunity to
                            take leadership in this field that has been neglected by too many people
                            in my Capital and your Capital, too.”</p>

                            opened the conversation with the remark that he had seen somewhere a
                            report that Secretary Fowler would be coming to Europe later in the
                            summer. He asked whether this was correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> replied that while it
                            was possible the Secretary might make such a trip before the Bank and
                            Fund meetings, the chances were rather against it.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Fowler attended the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meetings. Deming reported on his talks with Giscard
                                in telegram 1091 from Paris, August 31. (Ibid.)</note> However, as
                            it had been pointed out in the press communiquéon the
                            Fowler-Callaghan talks,<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">Not found. A

                            d'Estaing. The Bank and Fund meetings would provide one
                            opportunity for such discussions, and we had been glad to learn from Mr.
                            Larre that the Minister was planning to attend those meetings. On his
                            side, the Secretary was hoping he would be able to make a trip to Europe
                            for further discussions with some of his European colleagues sometime
                            later in the year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said, apropos of the Fowler-Callaghan talks, that there had seemed to
                            the French to be some contradiction between the impression given by the
                            communiquéand the remarks made by Chancellor Callaghan
                            following his return to London on the question of international
                            liquidity and the reform of the monetary system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said there had been
                            some discussion during the talks of the liquidity problem, but it had
                            been one among several items on the agenda, and had not consumed a
                            disproportionate amount of time. Much of the discussion had been devoted
                            to specific problems: e.g., the action being taken by the British to
                            liquify their official portfolio of U.S. <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0136"/>securities and its effects on the U.S. balance of
                            payments, and the revision that would be needed in the Anglo-American
                            Tax Treaty as a result of the reform which the British had undertaken of
                            their corporate tax law. The communiquéwas a fairly accurate
                            summary of the talks, naturally not going into the details of the
                            discussion, but reflecting quite well the amount of time devoted to the
                            various topics discussed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said he had two points which he wished to discuss with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName>: the current international
                            payments situation, as reflected in the position of France herself, and
                            the problem of international monetary reform. On the first topic, the
                            French were continuing to experience heavy inflows of foreign exchange.
                            In June, French reserves had, it is true, increased by only $9 million.
                            However, after adjusting for the scheduled payments of $33 million in
                            principal and interest on the debt to the U.S. and Canada, and for the
                            purchase by the British of $100 million against francs received in the
                            IMF drawing, the real inflow had been $142 million. On last Wednesday
                            (July 7)—the day of the week on which foreign exchange
                            receipts are concentrated—they had taken in $19 million. Thus
                            the trend seemed to be continuing in July. The impression of the French
                            authorities is that this continued inflow is the counterpart of the
                            weakness of sterling. For their part, they have done what they could to
                            discourage the movement of foreign money to Paris: They have reduced
                            their interest rate levels, forbidden the payment of interest on
                            foreign-owned franc balances and taken steps to curb foreign investment
                            operations in France. They do not feel that the problem of the
                            persistent payments imbalance is their concern. But they continue to be
                            aware of its existence through the growth of their reserves, and the
                            Minister wanted to flag this point for his American friends.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said on the subject of
                            the growth of French reserves there was one technical point which he
                            would like to raise. We understand the reasons behind the French policy
                            of converting all reserve increases into gold. Thus the present question
                            is not directed at the rationale of that policy; we would, however,
                            appreciate knowing whether the French authorities, in deciding each
                            month on how much to convert, make their calculations of reserve
                            increases on a gross or a net basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said this was indeed an important point. In the case of the June
                            figures, if the calculations were made on a gross basis, the conversion
                            would be $109 million, whereas, calculating on a net basis, it would be
                            only $33 million. On this point, the Minister continued, his staff
                            favored using the net basis, whereas in theory he felt the gross basis
                            was the proper one. After all, the gross figure represented the amounts
                            of reserve currency which France had received as a result of its
                            external economic and financial operations during any given month. It
                            was a point to which the French authorities would have <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0137"/>to devote a little further thought. In
                            the case of June, however, to convert on a gross basis would mean losing
                            the good effects of the $178 million debt prepayment. For this reason it
                            seemed likely that the July conversion would be effected on a net basis
                            and would thus amount to $33 million. In other words, the French
                            authorities were leaning towards the net basis for practical rather than
                            theoretical considerations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> recalled the
                            Minister's earlier comment that on a net basis, the growth of
                            French reserves in June had been only about $9 million. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said that while this was true, it had been decided at the beginning of
                            the year, as we knew, that the Bank of France would continue, as in
                            1964, to purchase 30 tons of gold every month and then in the following
                            month would adjust its purchase to make up the difference between the
                            30-ton minimum and the actual growth of reserves during the month in
                            question. Thus the monthly conversion figure for July would be 30 tons,
                            or about $33 million, rather than $9 million. Moreover, it was certain
                            that the inflow of foreign exchange during July, even if it continued to
                            be heavy, would not exceed the $178 million outflow represented by the
                            debt prepayment, so that in August the conversion would also be $33
                            million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            then turned to the question of the international monetary system. He
                            recalled that the French experts had put forward certain ideas
                            concerning how this reform might be accomplished. It was not the
                            intention of the French monetary authorities to continue pressing any
                            specific scheme, however. What they would continue to do was to point
                            out the need for reform, for they were convinced that the events of
                            recent days had not made that need any less urgent—indeed,
                            quite the contrary. They continued to be concerned regarding the
                            weakness of the British position from both an economic and a political
                            viewpoint. The timid deflationary measures taken by the British
                            authorities would probably have whatever effects they would be going to
                            on the British internal economic situation during the present third
                            quarter of the year. Seasonally this quarter was the least favorable for
                            the British balance of payments. Thus the prospects were for the
                            conjunction of an unfavorable domestic economic performance and poor
                            balance of payments results. This could very well produce a new currency
                            crisis of a considerable magnitude before the end of the year. In the
                            French view, such an outcome would be a real pity, for a reform of the
                            international monetary system could not be carried out in such an
                            atmosphere. No matter what was said, public opinion would interpret any
                            “reform” undertaken in the wake of a currency
                            crisis as merely a camouflage of a new set of measures taken to shore up
                            the British position. The French authorities recognized that it was not
                            for them to initiate the necessary action to deal with the unhealthy <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0138"/>situation. They had done what
                            they could to call attention to the problem. Now it was up to those upon
                            whom fell the major responsibility for the functioning of the present
                            system—namely, the reserve currency countries—to
                            accept that responsibility and decide how they wanted to deal with the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said that he was
                            pleased to hear the Minister say that the French did not intend to press
                            for the acceptance full-blown of their particular proposals. In the U.S.
                            view, the fastest and best way to make progress in considering
                            international monetary problems was for all those participating in
                            discussion of the matter to keep an open mind. For its part, the U.S.
                            Government had no specific “plan” for reforming
                            the monetary system. We had been considering the problem, and we felt
                            that by continuing the exchange of views with the other countries
                            principally concerned, we could during the months ahead move closer to a
                            meeting of the minds than might seem possible today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said that as for the
                            British problem,<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">Reference is to the third

                            Minister's forebodings. He expected that the measures already
                            taken by the British authorities, together with such additional measures
                            as they might see fit to take in the period ahead to reinforce their
                            program, would begin to show results in the near future. If one agreed
                            with the analysis that the problem of sterling was to a considerable
                            extent a matter of confidence, the evidence that the British authorities
                            were succeeding in their efforts to bring the economy under control
                            could result in a substantial turn-around in their foreign exchange
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said that he nevertheless feared a new crisis of confidence in sterling
                            and he did not know how it could be handled. The British had now
                            exhausted their drawing rights on the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Moreover, even if there were someone willing to lend
                            them the means to weather the storm, they could not forever keep going
                            further into debt. They had already piled up more than $4 billion in
                            debts in the last two or three years, which it was clear they would have
                            a most difficult time paying off. They could turn to the United States
                            for some help, but the result would be to put additional dollars into
                            circulation which would flow, for example, to France, where it would be
                            necessary to convert them into gold. France did not, of course, feel
                            particularly troubled by the prospects of a crisis insofar as she
                            herself was concerned. She was not a disturbing element in the
                            international payments situation. Her trade account was in balance.
                            While her balance of payments was in surplus, this resulted not so much
                            from the current account as from the inflow of
                            investments—above all American <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0139"/>capital—and there was reason to hope that
                            that inflow had moderated since the first quarter. She had ample
                            reserves to carry her through the storm. The French authorities knew
                            they did not have the responsibility for the management of the system.
                            But they could not help regretting the failure of those who
                            did—the reserve currency countries—to grasp the
                            opportunity now presented to them to make reforms in the system and
                            thereby avert disaster.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> recalled that if a new
                            sterling crisis should arise, the British were not without the means to
                            cope with it. In addition to the official reserves of the Bank of
                            England in gold and foreign exchange, they had about $1.2 billion in
                            U.S. securities, which, as the Minister knew, they had been putting into
                            liquid form but none of which had yet been taken into their reserves.
                            Part of these liquifying operations had already affected the U.S.
                            balance of payments accounts, although it was true that the dollars in
                            question were still in the hands of the British and had not yet been put
                            into circulation. There were also the Anglo-American swap and the $250
                            million Export-Import Bank credit. We were of course aware that the use
                            by the British of these facilities would mean putting new amounts of
                            dollars into circulation, which might, as the Minister had suggested,
                            come into the hands of France and other countries that would feel called
                            upon to convert them into gold. At the same time, we were encouraged by
                            the evolution of our own balance of payments. Mr. Deming said he had
                            informed WP-3 and the Economic Policy Committee of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> that for the first half of the
                            current year we estimated a deficit of $500 million on a seasonally
                            adjusted basis, compared to about $1 billion in the first half of 1964
                            and $2 billion in the second half of last year. This $500 million did
                            not of course include the French debt prepayment of $178 million, which
                            we were glad the French had agreed should take place on July
                            1—that is, in the second half of the year. We had
                            deliberately avoided making any forecasts regarding our balance of
                            payments for the remainder of the year. In general terms, however, we
                            expected that despite the less favorable seasonal factors in the second
                            half, it would continue to show improvement as a result of the
                            President's program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> noted, with reference
                            to the Minister's comments on the French balance of payments,
                            that in the WP-3 and EPC meetings, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Secretariat had forecast a considerable increase of
                            the surplus, compared to 1964.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Perouse explained to the Minister that the forecast of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> Secretariat was for a surplus in 1965
                            of around $1 billion for the franc area as a whole. He said that the
                            French experts thought that figure was too high. He reiterated the
                            French analysis that the surplus arose less from the current account,
                            which he described as showing only a modest surplus, than from capital
                            inflows and from the overseas franc <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0140"/>area. He emphasized the efforts of the French
                            authorities to discourage capital inflows and labeled a part of the
                            capital account surplus as the counterpart of the continued weakness of
                            sterling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> asked the Minister what
                            he thought would be the outcome of the sterling crisis he foresaw.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            replied that, speaking frankly, he thought devaluation of the pound
                            would be inevitable if a crisis did in fact arise. The present Labor
                            Government would certainly not survive any such foreign exchange crisis.
                            Whatever the complexion of the Government that followed them, its first
                            act would certainly be an adjustment of the exchange rate in order to
                            get some breathing space in which to formulate its own economic program
                            and in order to pin the responsibility for the devaluation on its
                            predecessor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> asked what the Minister
                            thought would be the reaction of the Continent to a sterling
                            devaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            replied that without question the Scandinavian countries would follow
                            sterling to the full extent. The reaction of the Continent would depend
                            upon the state of its own economic situation at the time the British
                            move took place. If—as it seemed likely would be the
                            case—economic activity on the Continent were rather slow, the
                            tendency for most countries would be to follow the British.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> asked if the French
                            authorities wanted to see sterling devalued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            replied that they emphatically did not. However, they feared that the
                            consequences of a continued lack of confidence in the pound, both within
                            and outside the sterling area, would leave the British monetary
                            authorities no alternative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said that this seemed
                            to us to argue that the United States, France and other countries which
                            played an important role in the monetary system should do their best to
                            insure that the British were not forced into such a corner. He asked how
                            the Minister envisaged that reform of the international monetary system
                            could help the British out of their difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said he was convinced that the burden of the sterling balances was such
                            that confidence in sterling could never be restored, unless and until
                            the British external accounts were relieved of that burden. The only way
                            he saw to accomplish this objective was to
                            “multi-lateralize” the sterling balances by
                            consolidating them through some international institution and allowing
                            the British to pay them off over the long term. Such a consolidation
                            could be included as one feature of a reform of the international
                            monetary system. If this reform also included measures to deal with the
                            other problems of the present monetary system and was carried out in an
                            atmosphere of calm deliberation rather than one of crisis, the
                            consolidation would be <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0141"/>greeted
                            by the public as an important strengthening of the British position and
                            would do much to restore confidence in sterling. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> said he had read with
                            interest the account published in the Economist of a week or so ago on
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> talks. That article had
                            mentioned the possible consolidation of the sterling balances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Perouse interjected to say that while this possibility had been
                            touched upon in the <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName>
                            conversations, it had not been explored in any detail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName> expressed the view that
                            working out an agreement on international monetary reform would require
                            considerable time. He thought it very doubtful that anything could be
                            concluded quickly enough to be of any assistance to the British in
                            dealing with a new sterling crisis in the months ahead if that were
                            indeed what was going to take place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing
                            said that he had two points by way of conclusion. First, he had found
                            the present exchange of views extremely useful and he hoped they could
                            be continued on future occasions, either with Secretary Fowler or with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName>. Second, he wanted
                            again to make clear the position of France in these international
                            monetary matters. While she had done what she could to focus attention
                            on the dangers she saw in the present situation, she realized that she
                            did not have the responsibility for initiating and putting into effect a
                            program to ward off those dangers. That responsibility belonged to the
                            reserve currency countries. Now, they could attempt to consolidate the
                            present system, and that seemed to be the import of the
                            communiquéon the Fowler-Callaghan talks, or they could
                            undertake a reform of the system. There was nothing wrong with
                            consolidating the present system, provided it could be accomplished
                            successfully. For their part, the French authorities thought reform
                            would be the more prudent course. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Frederick

                        <p>1. All addressee agencies should take special measures to prevent U.S.
                            activities in France which could needlessly embarrass United States

                            the United States, whether covert, clandestine, or overt, that could be
                            regarded as illegal or that could cause embarrassment to the United
                            States if the French decided to make an issue of them. The report should
                            be sufficiently detailed as to the nature, frequency and scope of
                            operations, and personnel and equipment involved, to permit judgments to
                            be made as to the implications thereof on U.S. foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>3. An illustrative list of some of the kinds of activities that should be

                            presented his credentials on December 15 in the Yellow Oval Room, the
                            President expressed his great pleasure at having Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> in Washington and said he looked
                            forward to working with him. The President asked the Ambassador to

                            in the Treaty Room. In his remarks to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> on this occasion, the President
                            noted that he had just read General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s comments in this television interview
                            concerning his attitude toward the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Reference is to an interview with Michel Drost of

                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had said that he
                            was not anti-American in his views; the President was convinced that
                            this was the case and that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s position had been exaggerated and
                            misrepresented by the <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0144"/>press. He
                            thought that, while there were obviously differences between our two
                            countries and our approach to problems, these were caused by differing
                            appreciations of our national interests. The President was sure that
                            “when the chips were down” France would be with us
                            as, indeed, had been the case in the past. He recalled that France was
                            our oldest friend and ally, virtually from the time when the United
                            States was conceived, and he felt sure that we could continue to count
                            on this.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that he
                            welcomed the President's remarks and was most appreciative of

                            basis if success not achieved. Thus golden opportunity could be lost.
                            Lucet stated Paris is aware of this situation. In his view <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> is quite willing to go ahead with
                            Kennedy Round negotiations even though there may be many difficulties.
                            Secretary replied technical difficulties, of course, must be expected
                            but he hoped they would not be compounded by political ones on the
                            French side. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> reiterated
                            belief in French willingness to get on with Kennedy Round
                            discussions.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> intended to
                            denounce them. Later <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            will be prepared to discuss with U.S. arrangements for facilities in
                            France in the event of a war in which France would be willing to
                            participate. Timing is not yet established but <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said possibly rather quickly,
                            and certainly before his visit to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>While we have no reason to doubt authenticity of this information, which
                            was relayed to source by <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve</persName>
                            immediately on arrival at Quai from Elysee, it nevertheless is extremely
                            curious. It counter-acts specifically and definitely <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s own statement in
                            press conference that these changes would be accomplished progressively
                            and that French allies would not suddenly be inconvenienced, and would
                            seem to represent a sudden and abrupt change of his policy and tactics
                            in this respect for as yet undisclosed reasons. In fact source said de
                            Gaulle had changed his position in last five days, i.e., since press
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>Source added that after denunciation issued, method and timing of U.S.
                            withdrawal was less important to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> and presumably could be carried out in manner to
                            minimize difficulties for us. Source described these decisions as a
                            declaration of neutralism on the part of France. Will have further

                            suitable time to review US policy toward France. He is opposed to basic
                            US objectives, such as a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, a
                            unified Europe and US efforts to maintain freedom in South Vietnam.
                            These strongly held, personal views of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> are unlikely to change. They
                            are largely based on his messianic belief in the glory and importance of
                            France, and thus are not subject to reasoned argument. Attempts to
                            propitiate President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            are unlikely to succeed and would probably only serve to increase the
                            level of his demands.</p>
                        <p>Policy toward President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            cannot be considered in isolation. It is and must remain an integral
                            part of our over-all foreign policy. While it would be possible to
                            devise a US policy which could bring about an accommodation with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, this would
                            require abandonment or modification of major US objectives. Such a price
                            is far too high to pay, particularly in view of the recent evidence that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does not
                            presently have majority support in France for many of his policies. The
                            US should make no substantial concessions to the policies of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, but should pursue
                            whatever policies it finds appropriate, irrespective of his
                            position.</p>
                        <p>In arriving at decisions on overall US policy, little weight should be
                            given to Gaullist views. We should operate on the assumption that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            leadership of France is temporary, and that he will be succeeded by a
                            government more responsive to public opinion, <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0148"/>hence more favorable to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, to a United Europe and to the United
                            States. However, in arriving at important policy decisions we should
                            give due weight to basic French views and interests as opposed to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            personal predilections. It may be difficult to sort things out in this
                            manner, but we should make the attempt.</p>
                        <p>While continuing firmly on our course in spite of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s views, we should
                            lean over backward to be polite and friendly to France, to President <hi rend="italic">de Gaulle</hi> personally, and to all French
                            government officials. Backbiting, recriminations, attempts to downgrade
                            the importance of France as a nation, or attempts at reprisals should be
                            avoided no matter what the temptation. They cannot be effective, will
                            only irritate President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            and make him more difficult to deal with, and are likely to cause French
                            public opinion to rally to his side against the US.</p>
                        <p>If President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> insists on
                            the removal of US forces from French soil, we should accede gracefully
                            and should move promptly to consider repositioning our line of
                            communications elsewhere. Attempts to dissuade President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or to obtain various
                            concessions would seem to be unwise, although it would be helpful if
                            France would maintain the LOC in a caretaker status. If France should
                            decide to pull out of any active role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we should not replace our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> tie with France by any bilateral agreement. Any such
                            agreement would make it much more difficult for France to return to the
                            fold at a later date and might set a pattern that could undermine the
                            whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> structure. In the event of a
                            French withdrawal, we should support the continuation of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization without France.</p>
                        <p>We should maintain our support for the Common Market, taking care that we
                            do not seem to take the lead in any effort to isolate France. If France
                            is to be isolated, it should clearly be by her own doing and not as the
                            result of American efforts.</p>
                        <p>In the event of French withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Common Market or other international bodies, it
                            should be made very clear to French public opinion that there is an
                            empty chair always ready and waiting for France should she decide to
                            return. This could be of major importance in maintaining the friendship
                            and confidence of the French people as opposed to President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and his personal followers.
                            We should continually work to preserve this basic friendship despite any
                            annoyance with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> or his government.</p>
                        <p>Finally, President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s growing fear of Germany, plus his desire
                            to cast France in a leading world position, may induce him to go to
                            unusual lengths to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. This
                            would be particularly likely if France should withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or substantially loosen her ties to
                            the other Common Market countries. We should always bear this
                            possibility in mind. If it comes <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0149"/>about, we should react calmly and philosophically, based on
                            circumstances at the time.</p>
                        <p>In summary, we should continue quietly and firmly on our course, ignoring
                            Gaullist objections but always showing respect and friendship towards
                            him and the French people, while awaiting the day when a more friendly
                            and cooperative government comes to power in France.</p>

                        <p>5434. For Secretary from Ambassador. Ref: Dept Circular 1644.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">
                                <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> I have most serious
                            reservations in regard to the wisdom of the policy outlined in ref
                            Depcirc in the light of probable French actions against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and presence of American forces on
                            French soil. The views expressed in this circular accurately define the
                            U.S. policy towards France as it has been since I have been in Paris and
                            which I strongly supported. It is always dangerous to transfer intact
                            one policy into a totally different set of circumstances and I believe
                            the French actions as reported to us in regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will radically change the situation.
                            I shall endeavor briefly to summarize these points:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            intentions in regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and our
                            forces in France are so radical as to amount to a complete destruction
                            from the French point of view of the entire <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization and cooperative defense efforts.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> obviously wishes to
                            have the appearance of the Alliance preserved so that he will be able to
                            say to the French people that he has done no damage at all to French
                            security interests. As I have already reported I do not think we should
                            facilitate his achievement of this purpose.</p>
                        <p>2. It would seem to me that we should judge our reaction in the light of
                            its effect on (A) French domestic opinion and specifically on the 1967
                            parliamentary elections (if not earlier), and (B) on the effect on our
                            Allies and consequently on Alliance.</p>
                        <p>In regard to (A) I am convinced that if we should “accede
                            gracefully” to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s actions against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and against our forces in <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0150"/>France this attitude would have a very
                            chilling effect upon the opposition in France. As indicated in the
                            message under reference less than 50 percent of the French people
                            support <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. If we should
                            turn the other cheek and accept these measures I feel that French public
                            and electoral opinion will certainly come to the belief that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is right, that he has made
                            some unimportant organizational changes without affecting at all
                            France's alliance with the U.S. and security interests. This
                            is the opinion that we get from most of our friends in the French
                            Government and in French political life. In fact a rather high official
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            government, whose name I will not give, told me recently that in his
                            opinion if the ordinary Frenchman came to the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actions against
                            the organization were seriously undermining the alliance with the U.S.
                            and the consequent security for France, there would be
                            “panic” in French public opinion. This may be an
                            exaggeration but it is clear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s game is to convince the people that
                            there is no damage to the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>On (B) I am not qualified from here to pass any judgment on the effect on
                            our Allies (this could be done in various capitals where this message is
                            sent), but certainly we cannot expect any of our Allies to get out ahead
                            of the U.S. in regard to reaction to the French moves. If we should
                            adopt as minimal a position as indicated in this message it would seem
                            to me obvious that the Alliance would be very seriously shaken and
                            possibly rendered ineffective—which incidentally is what
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> expects.</p>
                        <p>3. I do not propose any polemics or name calling against France and I
                            think we should avoid in any statements which we will make referring to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> by name. We
                            should preferably use the term “French
                            Government.” To pretend, however, that our relations were
                            normal, after what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                            apparently planning to do, in the hope of avoiding
                            “irritating” <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> is illusory. In the first place, what is there
                            left to preserve after he has in effect destroyed the French
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which I had
                            always assumed was a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>We obviously should make no final determination of our attitude until
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actual
                            moves against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and our presence in
                            France have been fully conveyed to us, but I seriously fear that to
                            follow the line of policy outlined in this message might easily lay our
                            entire European policy in ruins.<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">In telegram

                                Lucet</persName>, French Ambassador, March 31, 1966. Also present:

                            Assistant to the Vice President; Ted Van Dyk, Assistant to the Vice

                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would be going to Paris on Monday and would
                            be seeing President DeGaulle at that time. The Vice President asked the
                            Ambassador to convey his good wishes to President DeGaulle. The Vice
                            President made reference to his frank and friendly discussion with the
                            French President last June in Paris<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> and two U.S.
                                astronauts visited Paris June 18-20, 1965, to attend the Paris Air
                                Show. He met with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                                for 80 minutes on June 20 to discuss U.S. policy in the Dominican
                                Republic. The Embassy reported on the <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                    Gaulle</persName> talks in telegram 7219 from Paris, June 21,
                                1965. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7
                                US/HUMPHREY)</note> and said that he had reported fully to President
                            Johnson on that discussion. The Vice President expressed hope that
                            Presidents Johnson and DeGaulle might at some future time be able to
                            meet again directly.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then, on his initiative, went directly to President
                            deGaulle's visit to the Soviet Union.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">June 20-July 1.</note> The Ambassador said that
                            France expected no great result from President DeGaulle's
                            visit. He said: “We see no need for a French-Russian alliance
                            or some kind of pact.”</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that such discussions were important. He said
                            that the United States government, for its part, had no feeling of
                            concern that such French-Russian contact should not be made. The Vice
                            President then alluded to previous meetings he had held with Khrushchev
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, making the point
                            that discussion was always useful.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that the
                            French impression of the present Communist Party Congress<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">The 23d Congress of the Communist Party of the
                                Soviet Union was held March 29-April 8.</note> was that the Soviet
                            Union was deeply concerned with domestic matters. The French saw
                            mildness in Brezhnev's opening statement to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that “President DeGaulle will speak
                            to the Soviets regarding German reunification. We believe there can be
                            no real peace in Europe with a divided Germany.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> indicated that he
                            felt the road to reunification was a long one, but that the subject
                            definitely needed opening.</p>
                        <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0152"/>
                        <p>The Vice President said that European initiatives in this regard were
                            helpful. Certainly, he said, difficult territorial problems could not be
                            solved easily. He agreed with the Ambassador that a divided Germany was
                            a threat to peace. He had, he said, talked to Khrushchev regarding this
                            during his visit to the Soviet Union, but the Chairman had refused to
                            even discuss the subject.</p>
                        <p>An “environment” must be constructed, the Vice
                            President said, in which discussion was possible, in which positive
                            forces could be set in motion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that, in
                            France's opinion, Poland and Czechoslovakia were highly
                            important factors in any discussion of German reunification. He repeated
                            this twice.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President recalled that, during a visit to Germany in 1961, he
                            had made barest mention of the Oder-Neisse question<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">June 1961. On June 30 Humphrey made a statement
                                backing Mayor Willy Brandt's comments on the terms of the
                                German peace settlement.</note> and public opinion in Germany had
                            been deeply stirred. He indicated that any American discussion of the
                            Oder-Neisse would likely be misinterpreted in Germany, but that
                            “Europeans can talk about borders more easily than
                            we.”</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed, as Chairman of the National Aeronautics and
                            Space Council, that he was greatly impressed with French efforts thus
                            far in space. He was particularly pleased with France's role
                            in ESRO. The United States, he said, was particularly interested in ESRO
                            as a multilateral organization which could bring the benefits of space
                            exploration to all members of the European community. The Vice President
                            emphasized that space efforts were quite costly for any one nation, and
                            that a pooling of resources was certainly necessary. He hoped to discuss
                            this further with French space officials. The Ambassador replied that
                            France was highly pleased with French-<gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                        <p>In closing, the Vice President complimented Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> on the good impression he had
                            created during his short time in Washington. He mentioned that a group
                            of French parliamentarians had recently visited Washington, without
                            visiting the Senate. He had spoken to the State Department, he said,
                            expressing his wish that all future parliamentary delegations be brought
                            to the Senate.</p>

                            request.</p>
                        <p>Secretary noted that French Aide-Mémoire of April 22<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">American
                                    Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1966</hi>, p. 336.</note>
                            proposed that US and France begin to discuss “practical
                            measures” that should be taken concerning our bilateral
                            agreements. US is prepared to discuss any matter raised by France,
                            subject, of course, to consultation with our Allies, and finds Paris an
                            entirely appropriate place for discussion. Secretary said that in order
                            to prepare for discussions, however, we must have further info on
                            precise proposals France wishes to discuss.</p>
                        <p>Secretary noted French have stated that their agreements with US are
                            incompatible with its desire to resume full exercise of its sovereignty
                            in French territory. He wished to make unmistakably clear that French
                            sovereignty over French land and air has never been questioned by US.
                            Indeed US has not failed in past and is now pledged to defend French
                            sovereignty over French territory against armed attack. Very facilities
                            in question, installed at express invitation and by permission of <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>, are an earnest of that pledge.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US is willing to discuss any changes in bilateral
                            agreements which France desires and arrangements for their termination,
                            if necessary. We have expressed our willingness to evacuate French
                            territory, if this is France's desire, as soon as this can be
                            done without prejudice to Allied security. US is prepared to discuss use
                            of facilities established in accordance with agreements in time of peace
                            or conflict as French Aide-Mémoire of March 29 suggests.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">For text, see ibid., pp. 324-326.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary said, however, a proper respect for international agreements
                            precludes our acceptance of a unilateral denunciation of them. US has
                            proposed a way of terminating these agreements by mutual consent, to
                            which <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> has not yet responded.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said that nevertheless certain specific questions arise under
                            bilateral agreements, as follows: ` <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0154"/>1. US Military Headquarters Agreement of June 17,
                                1953,<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">For text, see 17 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 1906.</note> authorized
                            installation and operation of headquarters of US European Command.
                            Inasmuch as France has denounced protocol on status of International
                            Military Headquarters, to take effect April 1, 1967, it is intention of
                            US to move <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> as soon as a suitable
                            location can be found and arrangements made. US will, therefore, be
                            prepared to discuss “practical measures” for this
                            move at an appropriate time. Meanwhile, we would like to know what
                            “practical measures” France wishes to discuss. We
                            are prepared to discuss any French proposals re US Military Headquarters
                            Agreement and we would like to know if it is desire of France that we
                            agree to its termination.</p>
                        <p>2. Under Pipeline Agreement of June 30, 1953,<note n="6" xml:id="d58fn6">For text, see 18 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 352.</note> an
                            oil pipeline has been laid at US expense across French territory and
                            operated by French company for both use by France and US in peacetime
                            and by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> in wartime. We would
                            like to know what changes in Agreement are desired by France. Does
                            France object to flow of oil in pipeline across France for use of US
                            forces in Germany? Does France object to present operation of
                            pipeline?</p>
                        <p>3. Chateauroux Agreement of February 27, 1951,<note n="7" xml:id="d58fn7">For text, see 17 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 1865.</note>
                            establishes an air depot at Deols and La Martinerie for supply of US Air
                            Forces in Europe. Air Bases Agreement of October 4, 1952,<note n="8" xml:id="d58fn8">For text, see 17 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss>
                                1873.</note> authorizes construction and use of certain airfields in
                            France for US Air Force missions in furtherance of common defense plans.
                            Both these Agreements require French approval before flights may be made
                            from these bases which are not in furtherance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> missions or in support of US forces
                            in Europe. It is intention of US in view of attitude of France to remove
                            air squadrons and supporting forces from these bases as soon as
                            practicable after consultation with its Allies. US will also be prepared
                            to discuss Agreements themselves. Does France request US to agree to
                            termination of these Agreements and evacuation of bases and depots? Are
                            these facilities among those referred to in French
                            Aide-Mémoire of March 29 as facilities “on which
                            the two governments could reach mutual agreement in the event of a
                            conflict in which both countries would participate under the Atlantic
                            Alliance.” Does this preclude use of such facilities in event
                            that France should not participate in a conflict arising from an armed
                            attack against a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> member?</p>
                        <p>4. System of Communications Agreement of December 8, 1958,<note n="9" xml:id="d58fn9">For text, see 17 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss>
                                1890.</note> authorizes a network of depots and other facilities for
                            supply of US <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0155"/>Army in Europe.
                            Under this Agreement France may propose a review or modification and, if
                            not satisfied with response, may give notice of termination in due
                            course. US is prepared to discuss any proposals France may have for
                            review or modification of Agreement and would put same questions as it
                            has put re Chateauroux and Air Bases Agreements.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Secretary said that since US is entirely willing to discuss our
                            bilateral agreements and practical measures relating thereto, we hope
                            that France will aid in preparation for early discussions by providing
                            clarification requested. In meantime we ask that French Govt designate
                            someone with whom we can be in contact on a number of working level
                            problems incident to moving of US military facilities out of France.</p>

                            amend the duration provision of four of the agreements to bring them
                            into line with the duration provisions of the System of Communications
                            Agreement. The two-year provision of the last agreement is
                            “too long” as it is in conflict, he said, with the
                            April 1, 1967 deadline.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary said (1) that we cannot accept a unilateral repudiation
                            of agreements to which we are a party, (2) that we had proposed one
                            possible method of reaching mutual agreement on termination (two-year
                            provision), (3) that we are not adopting a doctrinaire, dogmatic
                            position on the conditions for terminating these agreements, and (4)
                            that the U.S. is prepared to discuss the possibility of terminating the
                            five agreements in question by mutual consent. However, in order to have
                            a very clear understanding of the current French suggestion <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, referring to the earlier <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> decision that the five agreements must
                            terminate by April 1, 1967, asked: “May I take it then that
                            this latest French suggestion is not a decision as it has appeared to us
                            to be, but is now a proposal for terminating the agreements through
                            mutual consent?” <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName>
                            replied affirmatively. Continuing, Ball emphasized that we were prepared
                            to try to arrive at a solution through mutual consent, but that we could
                            not accept a solution by fiat. Lucet concurred.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding the US Military Headquarters Agreement (1953), the Air Bases
                            Agreement (1952), and the System of Communications Agreement (1958),
                                <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> did not expect any particular
                            negotiating problems with the US. Discussions on these three agreements
                            would concern primarily the practical measures to be taken for the
                            removal of US personnel and facilities between now and April 1,
                            1967.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was
                            prepared to consider this proposal for the April 1, 1967, date in order
                            to see if we could mutually agree on it.</p>
                        <p>4. Regarding the Chateauroux Depot Agreement (1951), <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> recognized that the problems involved in this agreement
                            were more complex than those related to the three just mentioned, and
                            was therefore fully prepared to discuss any US requirements for
                            “further delays.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it would be useful to discuss a practical
                            termination date.</p>
                        <p>5. Concerning the Pipeline Agreement, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said: “As for the Pipeline Agreement of
                            June 30, 1953, it is a question of defining the <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0157"/>new conditions under which it could
                            continue to operate, once the American personnel have been evacuated
                            between now and April 1, 1967.” In commenting on this part of
                            his instructions, Lucet said that there is no <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> intention to cut the pipeline now or after April 1,
                            1967, and that his Government welcomed discussions with the US on its
                            future use. He mentioned continued use of it to supply US troops in
                            Germany. Acting Secretary said that the US will be prepared to have
                            discussions on this matter.</p>
                        <p>6. Concerning 1952 Air Bases Agreement, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had mentioned our desire to move aircraft and
                            material out of France and asked that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> designate an individual with whom we could discuss this
                            matter. He stated that if the US would name an official to carry on such
                            discussions, the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> would do likewise.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed to provide such a
                            name.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to Secretary's question concerning the
                            facilities, mentioned in French aide-mémoire of March 29,
                            “on which the two Governments could reach mutual agreement in
                            the event of a conflict in which both countries would participate under
                            the Atlantic Alliance,” <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that these were logistical facilities that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may need in case of war, such as
                            ports, transport facilities, stockage and air bases—i.e.,
                            “the same type that is now available to US in
                            peacetime.” The <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>, he said,
                            is ready to discuss and to conclude an agreement on the use of these
                            facilities in wartime.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> continued: “As
                            a counterpart, we French would like to discuss the question of putting
                            tactical nuclear weapons at the disposal of French forces in wartime
                            under the conditions which have existed up to now.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the terms and
                            conditions under which French forces would remain in Germany would first
                            have to be determined. Depending on the achievement of a satisfactory
                            agreement regarding those terms and conditions, the United States would
                            then be prepared to discuss this subject with the <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> interjected that his instructions were not limited
                            to the provision of nuclear warheads for French forces in Germany.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the French
                            Government had never permitted United States nuclear warheads on French
                            soil. Lucet seemed confused at this point and indicated that he would
                            seek clarification of his instructions.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> hoped that US-French
                            discussions on the foregoing questions could be undertaken as soon as
                                possible.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">Telegram 3766, July 8,

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> seemed very relaxed and
                            in excellent health and humor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Soviet Union, Europe and Germany:</p>
                        <p>I asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> if he
                            could give me his estimate of the current Soviet problem and its future
                            evolution, particularly in regard to Europe and to Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said it was his feeling that
                            the Soviet Union at the present state of its development was not
                            bellicose, certainly did not wish any armed clash, and would avoid any
                            action which might provoke a crisis with the West. He hastened to
                            qualify his general remarks by saying that this could change and it was
                            for this reason that France was remaining in the Alliance while leaving
                            the organization. He said he thought that the Soviet leaders were
                            generally seeking a détente, obviously for their own
                            purposes, but that he personally felt it was to the advantage of the
                            West to support this position. He realized the Western attitude toward
                            France was to Russia's advantage, but he also felt that it
                            was to a certain extent to French advantage.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Europe, he thought that the Soviet Union at the present time
                            was interested in having a general détente with the West, but
                            in reply to my question admitted that what the Soviets were after
                            immediately was some recognition of the two Germanies, which, he
                            continued, was actually in effect at the present time, although he
                            hastened to add that he would not take any official action which would
                            appear to confirm it. He also said in regard to unification that this
                            was a very long process and the only thing that he might conceivably
                            obtain in Russia was some indication of reunification as a very long
                            range aim.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I thought we could all agree on the desirability of a
                            détente with Russia but that, as he knew, this had been a
                            constantly recurring theme in post-war relations. However, we recognized
                            the danger of trying to create a détente when there were
                            serious elements of instability caused by the Soviets on the European
                            scene, namely the division of Germany and Berlin.</p>
                        <p>This led to a discussion of Germany and its reunification, which I found
                            of some interest.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that as matters now
                            stood West Germany, although powerful economically, from a military and
                            political point of view constituted no danger to anybody, that the
                            reunification of Germany, for which the French stood in principle, if it
                            came about suddenly would result first of all in the consolidation of
                            Soviet hold over the countries of Eastern Europe (which he said would be
                            a very bad thing) because those countries would seek protection from a
                            more powerful Germany. In addition he said it would cause a considerable
                            amount of apprehension in Western Europe. I pointed out that on the
                            other hand a continued division of Germany would produce so strong a
                            frustration in Germany as to raise all sorts of different dangers. De
                            Gaulle shrugged his shoulders and said, “It is always
                            necessary to choose between two evils in politics.”</p>
                        <p>I told him that I thought his schedule was a very heavy one in Russia but
                            that I thought he would receive a wonderful reception since the Soviet
                            Govt was a past master in arranging such receptions. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> smiled and said the Soviet
                            Govt could create anything that it wants among its people.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">The Embassy in the Soviet Union reported on

                            could conceivably bring about the possibility of a negotiation. I
                            replied that I thought that this depended on what was meant by leaving
                            the country. We had repeatedly said, and meant it, that we had no
                            intention of leaving any troops in Vietnam after a settlement was made,
                            but obviously they could not expect the US to withdraw the troops before
                            such a settlement, and in any event we had never been able to obtain the
                            slightest indication of any interest in negotiating from the other

                        <p>I then mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> the
                            French decision, which <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de
                                Murville</persName> had told the Secretary in Brussels, concerning
                            the removal of the French air squadrons.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">See

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> confirmed this and said
                            that the reason was of course that since they were not to be integrated
                            they could not stay on in Germany, which was not the case with the
                            ground forces.</p>
                        <p>I asked him then if he did not think that this decision radically altered
                            the whole problem of French ground forces since whatever troops <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0160"/>remained there, assuming they
                            did, would require some degree of air protection, presumably from the
                            other allies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> denied this and said
                            distances were so small that French air squadrons based in France could
                            equally protect troops in Germany. He said in truth (en
                            verité) France did not really wish to keep her forces in
                            Germany. It was for this reason she had phrased the last communication
                            to the Germans which said they would only remain if there were a
                            positive German desire for political or symbolic reasons for them to
                            remain. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said militarily
                            the troops would be in approximately the same position if across the
                            border in France.</p>
                        <p>In order to have complete clarity on this subject, I asked the General if
                            he meant that France would have no desire to leave the troops in Germany
                            but preferred to have them in France. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> said that perhaps “desire”
                            was the wrong word, but that France would not have any interest in the
                            sense of state interest, and that objectively it would be better if the
                            French troops were back in France. However, he emphasized that if the
                            Germans really wanted the troops, for whatever reason, France would be
                            willing to see if this could be arranged.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It will be noted that there was nothing
                            essentially new in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s remarks to me, with the possible
                            exception of the French attitude towards the French troops in Germany.
                            What he said here was confirmation of what we had heard from another
                            source, but it is perhaps the first time that he has stated it so
                            specifically to a foreigner.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            remarks on Germany indicated his fear of a reunified Germany and his
                            description of the concentration, i.e., huddling, of Eastern European
                            states under Moscow's wing and apprehension in Western Europe
                            was of interest and perhaps not too far from the truth. It is however
                            apparent that he apparently expects, and indeed desires, Germany to stay
                            divided for a long period of time, and that even when reunification
                            comes about it will be more a facade than a reality since at one point
                            in the conversation he said there never can be another Reich.</p>
                        <p>I don't know how you wish to handle the statement to me about
                            French troops in Germany, but I would perhaps wait a little before
                            authorizing its repetition to any foreign source. I shall not mention
                            this point in my conversation with any of my diplomatic colleagues
                                here.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">In telegram 8683 from Paris, June

                                the retention or not of French troops in Germany <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was obviously acting with
                                certainty that this information would be conveyed to the Germans. He
                                probably felt that this could not hurt, and might indeed improve,

                            grounds that it would send him to Moscow with absolutely no real

                        <p>1393. 1. When I called on <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> at
                            his request at Foreign Office this morning, I found him tired and
                            discouraged. (He hopes to get away on leave Tuesday morning after seeing
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> on Monday.) <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said he was forced to conclude
                            that there existed very genuine resentment at French policies in US, and
                            that there was a general distrust of France. He cited recent polls in
                            this connection. He said US opinion did not seem to pinpoint its
                            dissatisfaction with France but that there certainly was an increasingly
                            unfortunate climate. I of course cited French policies on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Vietnam as fundamental reasons
                            for this unhappy attitude which he found in US.</p>

                        <p>1445. For Under Secretary from Ambassador. It looks very much as though,
                            if we want it to be that way, the August 2 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> could well wind up
                            the discussions in regard to the use of bases and facilities in time of
                            war. It seems clear that the chief sticking point, as I have previously
                            mentioned, will be the event which will commence U.S. reentry into bases
                            or re-takeover of certain facilities. The French will in all probability
                            think that this kick-off point will be the French declaration of war
                            whereas naturally we must insist that it be the request by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> for an alert.</p>

                        <p>I am asking you to let me have your judgment as to whether Washington
                            would prefer to break this off quickly and cleanly (with possible
                            exception of the pipeline) or whether you would prefer to string it out
                            and postpone it until September or even October. I could play it either
                            way with great ease but I think some indication of the considerations
                            which you might have in mind dictating either an early termination or
                            playing it along would be most useful to me.</p>
                        <p>I would very much appreciate if you could give me your thought before
                            Tuesday, August 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">In telegram 19145, August

                        <p>2592. August 25.</p>
                        <p>1. I was informed today that following decisions had been taken August 23
                            at interministerial meeting presided over by <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> with reference to US-French bilateral military
                            problems and more especially with regard to French relationship to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>2. French Government had been genuinely shocked to learn that French had
                            failed to take over installations which US already ready to return
                            (Paris 2515)<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">Telegram 2515 from Paris, August
                                24, reported <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s démarche to the French
                                regarding their uncooperative stance on pipeline maintenance.
                                (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> FR-US)</note> and Prime Minister
                            had instructed <persName corresp="#p_MP2">Messmer</persName> to have
                            Army engineers instantly prepared to receive these facilities.</p>
                        <p>3. With regard to pipeline, it was decided refuse permission for 40 US
                            technicians to assist in operation US pipeline. French position was
                            identical for both US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            pipelines. US pipeline would not be closed nor would we be expelled from
                            France but US would be <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0164"/>given
                            time to install pipeline elsewhere. If no US technicians were introduced
                            and US accepted French position on re-entry, then pipeline could
                            continue to operate for benefit US forces. However, there was no change
                            in French position on re-entry which was that France would first have to
                            decide Article V should be invoked. Ambassador is to be informed of this
                            decision officially September 9.</p>
                        <p>4. With regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military budget,
                            Deleusse would give French position to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> September 7. France would not make any payments toward
                            major <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> headquarters. However,
                            France would contribute five million francs which had been earmarked for
                            repairs on old <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> headquarters
                            towards costs of transferring <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>
                            and other headquarters.</p>
                        <p>5. France would not contribute towards costs of telecommunications
                            projects. France would participate in leasing communications facilities
                            such as PTT lines for long-range protection purposes and in connection
                            with France's new role towards these organizations, i.e.
                            France is now present in only a liaison capacity. With regard to Ace
                            High (forward scatter system) France would contribute budgetarily so
                            long as this system remained useful. In general on these projects France
                            would contribute in accordance with the degree of agreement which was
                            reached between France and her allies. France would continue in The
                            Hague and La Spezia centers but would withdraw from AGARD and London
                            Bureau and such similar organizations.</p>
                        <p>6. With regard to infrastructure, France would not participate in Slice
                            XVIII or any subsequent slices. Insofar as Slice XVII and earlier slices
                            were concerned, France would continue to contribute to projects for
                            which money had already been allocated and on which work had already
                            started.</p>
                        <p>7. Concerning Namso and Hawk projects, France was not particularly
                            interested in principle but these could remain for some time, until such
                            date as perhaps 1969, if other Allies wish. France would not oppose
                            their remaining or leaving. If they left, France would withdraw.
                            Otherwise France's attitude towards these agencies is similar
                            to her view regarding <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In general, we were told attitude
                            underlying decisions was that France should be tough on withdrawal of
                            all agencies which they had already asked to leave, including US
                            installations, and deadlines were to be enforced insofar as possible.
                            However, with regard to other agencies which had not been discussed so
                            far, there was no particular urgency in getting them out. Attitude
                            toward latter group was to be flexible and waiting for time to take care
                            of them. In conclusion, I was told that <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> terminated meeting indicating he thought
                            “everything” would eventually go except
                            overflights.</p>

                            evening, General, after ascertaining I spoke French, asked to talk to me
                            alone. I had deliberately not emulated my numerous colleagues who
                            requested private conversations with him, but I was summoned immediately
                            after Dean.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> began by requesting I
                            send his very warmest wishes to President Johnson. He added with a
                            twinkle that the route to Cambodia did not go by Washington. I assured
                            him I would transmit.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he would talk
                            about the Americans while in Cambodia. He added quickly that he admired
                            and liked the Americans. There should be no question about that. But one
                            must say what one thinks. And the Americans would thank him for it
                            later. It was in their interest and in the interest of all that he would
                            speak. I replied that US would thank him if his actions and words served
                            both peace and justice.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said war must be
                            ended. He asked me why the US did not just announce that it wanted
                            peace, that it would stop fighting and that it would leave Vietnam. We
                            did it, he said, why can't you. It was not difficult to do. I
                            asked what [he] thought would happen afterward if we followed his
                            advice. “Afterwards,” he exclaimed throwing up his
                            arms in well known gesture, “afterwards leave it to
                            them.” I commented with a smile that I always found it ironic
                            to hear a European of his generation advocate peace at any price. I had
                            just returned from an extended period in Washington, I could assure him
                            that President Johnson was passionately interested in ending the war and
                            in peace. Then end the war, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> interjected. I replied that perhaps it was an
                            American peculiarity but we could not simply walk away from commitments
                            and responsibilities, particularly when they had implications that
                            appeared to me to be far greater than those involved in Algeria in 1958.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> commented that he
                            did not want the US to leave Vietnam at once but to announce its
                            determination to <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0166"/>do so and to
                            halt the hostilities, then gradually phase out. Thus the way to peace
                            would be opened. I asked why he if he were so interested in peace, he
                            did not seek to convince the Soviets to call a peace conference instead
                            and to end the fighting in that manner. Oh, he laughed, that route was a
                            complex impasse.</p>
                        <p>6. Since his aides appeared nervous about extended conversation, I broke
                            if off by suggesting others might wish to talk to him. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he wanted to be certain
                            that President Johnson knew he extended his warmest wishes.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in top form and went
                            out of his way to compliment US on what had been achieved since his last
                            visit in 1953 to Ethiopia where he had today remarked on development for
                            which US could take much credit.</p>

                            ignoring facts in favor of his favorite position. We have already
                            commented on historical errors contained in speech but it is
                            extraordinary to me that an alleged ally of the U.S. would present right
                            on the spot within a few kilometers of the battle line so erroneous a
                            picture of cause and effect. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> appears to heap all the blame for the situation,
                            its origin and development in Indochina, on the U.S. explicitly. I
                            recall in this connection <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0167"/>Paris

                            or has been unwilling to really acquaint himself with the facts of the
                            situation in Vietnam. He makes no mention of Communism as a factor and
                            consequently his comparison with the French in Algeria is erroneous and
                            misleading.</p>
                        <p>I realize how unwise it is to answer <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> publicly but I wonder in this case if some
                            corrective measure should not be applied. Otherwise the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> version of events will have a
                            high degree of acceptance not only here in France but in other countries
                            of the world. I would suggest therefore that you consider very seriously
                            the desirability of a statement by the President or you which would in
                            no way mention <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s Phnom Penh speech but deal with the same

                            actual suggestion as to what the U.S. should do in the future but merely
                            to those parts dealing with the origin and history of the Vietnam
                            question. There may be strong reasons against any such statement but I

                        <p>3124. Sept 7. In conducting these discussions on reentry or reutilization
                            of facilities in France I have kept constantly in mind the phrase in my
                            instruction which tells me that “the record should
                            demonstrate that failure to reach agreement was not due to
                            unreasonableness of U.S. Government.” The more however I
                            think on this subject the clearer it is to me that there is no formula
                            that could possibly be devised which <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0168"/>would really solve the problem of the timing of reentry
                            once the French had decided to liquidate the existing peacetime bases
                            and facilities. Our present position of insisting that the time of
                            reentry would be fixed by the declaration of an alert (of any kind)
                            really in substance may not much differ in point of time from a
                            declaration of war. Of all of the formulas it seems to me
                            “following consultation and agreement between the two
                            governments” would be the most reasonable and practicable.
                            There is no absolute guarantee that the French would agree, even when we
                            sought it through diplomatic channels, but at least it would leave to us
                            the timing of the effort in the light of existing situation at the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>However, in regard to the pipeline I am concerned, as I set forth in
                            Paris 1597,<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">In telegram 1597 from Paris,
                                August 2, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> requested
                                clarification of details for his discussion with the French. (Ibid.,
                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> FR-US)</note> that if after

                            Incidentally, I have had no reply to this message and would like to have
                            some word on the subject prior to my meeting at 4 p.m. on Friday,
                            September 9.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">In telegram 3330 from Paris,
                                September 9, <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> reported
                                on what he described as the French “balance
                                sheet” regarding a future reoccupation and reutilization
                                of military facilities and inquired if he should seek a meeting with
                                Couve on the issue. In telegram 46823, September 14, the Department
                                of State responded that there was no need for such a meeting prior
                                to <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>'s return

                        <p>I shall use every effort to try and make the French position, i.e., of no
                            action until declaration of war, as clear as possible and will discuss
                            with Couve the possibility of an exchange of letters which would provide
                            us with a solid record of these talks. However, all matters will still
                            be ad referendum to Washington which will give us some more time to
                            consider the various factors involved.</p>

                            letting me have his views on the British tentative bid for entry into
                            the Common Market.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said while of course he
                            could not decide what others intended to do it was his impression that
                            England was “not ready” to join the Common Market
                            and would seek to obtain concessions from the other members. I told him
                            that according to our information the British were very serious about
                            joining the Common Market but on the supposition that Great Britain
                            would join the Rome Treaty without concessions to her interest with
                            merely a transitional period. What did he think then would be the
                            possibility? I mentioned in this connection the problem of the pound
                            sterling. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> immediately
                            said that this would have to be settled; that it was not possible for a
                            member of the Common Market to have the burden of sterling balances or
                            the pound with its position as a reserve currency. I then asked him
                            about the so-called political questions of which we occasionally heard
                            here in France, referring to his statement in the press conference of
                            the Nassau Agreements. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            then gave quite a long dissertation to the following effect:</p>
                        <p>He said if Europe was to be formed it would have to be European in
                            outlook and in action; that if the Economic Community of Europe was to
                            ever develop into any political direction all its members would have to
                            have a European point of view, and in reply to my specific question he
                            admitted that close relations with the U.S. such as England had, and,
                            added parenthetically, Germany sought to have were incompatible with
                            this European outlook. He was quick however to say that he was not
                            speaking about the policy of the U.S. but of the attitude of countries,
                            i.e., England and Germany towards it.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that since it was obvious that any question of the
                            formation of Europe would take a long long time, to which he agreed, <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0171"/>how did he expect the relations
                            between an individual country and the U.S. to develop during this
                            interim period. This question seemed to set him back a little since he
                            said of course America could and should have excellent relations with
                            all members of Europe, but he did not think they should be in any way
                            privileged or special as was the case of England and as the Germans
                            tried to achieve.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> for him was quite specific in his attitude toward
                            Great Britain joining the Common Market. He professed disbelief in their
                            willingness to accept the conditions of the Common Market but even if
                            that occurred he raised objections, particularly in regard to the
                            position of sterling and in the larger and much vaguer field of
                            relationships with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>I do not know how this should be handled with the British since we do not
                            wish to have any responsibility for chilling the British effort. Perhaps
                            the best thing to do would be to tell them in very general terms without
                            being specific. I would appreciate Department's guidance for
                            dealing with Ambassador here.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, I paid a call on
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and we had
                            approximately one hour's conversation. The only other person
                            present was Andronikov, the interpreter.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of amenities during which I conveyed to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> your personal
                            greetings and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> requested
                            that I give to you his cordial personal wishes, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said they had been following
                            very closely reports of your operation<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">The
                                President had surgery November 16.</note> and had been delighted at
                            your complete recovery. We then discussed the following subjects:
                            Soviet/Chinese relations; Vietnam; and East/West relations in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>I mentioned that we thought the developments in China were of greatest
                            importance although we did not know exactly what their meaning was. We
                            had felt in our discussions with the Russians that China was always
                            present in the background of their talks. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> replied that relations between the Soviet Union
                            and China were not good and in his opinion would get worse. He said they
                            had discussed this subject with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> during his recent visit and that my observation
                            had been quite correct, that China was always present in Soviet
                            thoughts. China had not yet acquired the means of power but they were
                            working hard to obtain them. He considered they were more fearful of the
                            Soviets which surrounded China to the north than they were of the U.S.
                            The Soviets see everything in Chinese terms, even including Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I told the General that in recent conversations with the Russians, who
                            had never been willing to discuss China, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had nonetheless said there was an element of
                            irrationality in Chinese developments which made it difficult to draw
                            correct conclusions. I said that if Vietnam were only a question with
                            the Soviets, we were convinced that they would be prepared for
                            settlement along the lines of the Geneva accords of 1954 and the 17th
                            Parallel but that because of Peking and the limited Soviet interests in
                            Hanoi there was not much that could be done.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> remarked that the
                            Russians were very much worked up against the U.S. over Vietnam and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had said that were it
                            not for Vietnam there could be a real détente in the world.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had stated that the
                            Soviet Union was in fact making war against the U.S. in Vietnam, not
                            with troops, but with material, construction, etc.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to the General (and of course our entire conversation was
                            confidential) that we had at the end of 1965 been told by the Soviets
                            that if there could be a bombing pause for from fifteen to twenty days
                            this would permit governments to explore with Hanoi the possibility of a
                            peaceful settlement. We had ceased the bombing for almost double that
                            period but nothing had come from Hanoi except the standard four points.
                            Hanoi would not talk, possibly for fear of Peking, and the other
                            governments cannot speak in their own name, but with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> and Hanoi it is difficult indeed to
                            determine with whom to talk in the interest of peace. In the case of
                            Cuba it had been procedurally simple since there the conversation was
                            direct with Moscow. I said General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> would recall Hanoi's four points, three
                            of which presented no problems, but point three, which insisted on the
                            acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> program as a basis
                            for future South Vietnam. Last spring, through contacts, we had
                            attempted to propose a revision of point three, but received no
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that he was of the
                            opinion that the North Vietnamese will not negotiate under present
                            conditions no matter how <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0173"/>costly
                            the war became. He said the North Vietnamese would persist even under
                            bombardment, and would continue to fight rather than to yield or
                            renounce their aims, and he repeated that they would never negotiate
                            under the condition of the U.S. being present in the country.</p>
                        <p>I told him that the military problem of the twenty organized regular
                            North Vietnamese regiments was not too difficult to deal with. The main
                            problem was that of guerrilla infiltration and infrastructure in the
                            villages. I mentioned that in addition to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> obligation the U.S. had security treaties with Japan,
                            Formosa, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines, New Zealand and
                            Australia, and that obviously in any action we took in regard to Vietnam
                            we would have to consider the effect on general security in the area. I
                            agreed with the General that there would probably be no formal
                            negotiations or any conference but that rather the problem might be
                            settled de facto as had been done in Greece. We had even attempted
                            indirectly with Hanoi to de-escalate the war to facilitate de facto
                            settlement. I told the General that in our one hundred thirty talks with
                            the Chinese Communists over ten years that they had always insisted that
                            Formosa, with its thirteen or fourteen million population, must be given
                            to China.</p>
                        <p>I asked General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> whether
                            he had any impression from his talks with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in regard to Soviet policy towards Europe, and
                            in particular whether the Soviets would respond to any possible German
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> replied that he thought
                            the Russians were very anxious for a détente in Europe and,
                            he said parenthetically, even with the U.S. in regard to Vietnam; that
                            they were no longer aggressive or menacing, even in Berlin, which had
                            receded to second place in their thoughts. They wished to develop
                            economic and technical relations with France and not only with France.
                            However, they continued to show themselves to be very suspicious and
                            distrustful of Germany. Part of this may have some truth in it, but he
                            is convinced the larger part is simply a politically motivated attitude.
                            He said they wished to have a détente with the Federal
                            Republic, but only on condition of the German acceptance of existing
                            frontiers and renunciation of any pretensions to nuclear weapons, and
                            acceptance of two Germanies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he told <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> there might be two German
                            states but there was only one German people and sooner or later,
                            although it will take a long time through the process of
                            détente, the two Germanies will come together. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said perhaps one day this could
                            occur, but the moment had not yet come, but he did say perhaps. It is
                            conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> meant
                            that by the increasing of contacts between the two Germanies there might
                            some day in the future be a sort of confederation, but at present he
                            would not say this and kept reiterating the point about two
                            Germanies.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> the
                            enormous cost the failure to solve the German problem had been to both
                            sides. The cost to the U.S. for armaments in the post-war period had
                            been in the neighborhood of nine hundred billion dollars and a large
                            part of this had been due to failure to settle German problems. The
                            Soviets had likewise incurred heavy expenses. The German question as it
                            now stood was the only question I could conceive of which might lead to
                            a war directly between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If the German question could be settled and stability
                            returned to Central Europe this would open very wide perspectives to the
                            world in the form of trade, disarmament, and other fields.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> answered that the French
                            had been trying for some time to persuade the Germans to make some
                            gesture to show that they did not have any evil design on Eastern
                            Europe. It is possible that Brandt and Kiesinger will produce something
                            of this nature. He said that it was ridiculous for the Germans to expect
                            that they can by abrupt action recover the lost territory of Prussia and
                            Saxony. He went on to say that he was convinced that the Soviet Union
                            was interested only in China and their own development and had no
                            intention of initiating any armed attack in Europe and that the Germans
                            really should do something and not just say “America,
                            America” and hope that this will solve all their
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>I then mentioned to the General that time is getting short since we are
                            on the threshold of new dimensions in defense problems, namely the
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>; the Soviets are beginning to
                            deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s in the Moscow area and if
                            both sides began to deploy them the cost would be phenomenal. This in
                            turn would lead to an increase in offensive missiles to overcome the
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and then armaments would have an
                            indefinite expansion. He said he thought it was very important that we
                            should find some ceiling or some method of controlling this armament
                            race before it entered into a new phase. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> remarked that the only policy there was to make
                            peace and he felt this was also true in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that in Laos in 1962 we thought we had achieved a real
                            solution but unfortunately the North Vietnamese continued the guerrilla
                            infiltration and the area controlled by the Pathet Lao was barred to
                            others. I said personally I thought there was a good chance that the
                            Soviet Government had wished to support that agreement but it was just
                            about this time, around 1962, that the Soviets had lost influence in
                            Hanoi. I said I was convinced if it was only up to Moscow and
                            Washington, peace would soon be made in Vietnam but Chinese influence
                            was too strong in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said the U.S. had its
                            own policy and it was not up to him to give advice but he felt the U.S.
                            was becoming bogged down in <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0175"/>secondary and ridiculous considerations in Vietnam, particularly when
                            we think of what could be done for world peace if this issue was
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>I replied we could easily stop the half of the war we were responsible
                            for, but what about the other half.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said if the U.S. was not
                            in Vietnam there would be no war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in conclusion said that
                            he felt that despite our differences the Franco-American friendship
                            remains strong, to which I replied that I thought the history of the
                            post-war period would show that American and French interests in most
                            cases had been identical.</p>
                        <p>As we left <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> particularly
                            asked that his cordial greetings be extended to you.</p>

                        <p>During a brief conversation at a French Embassy reception today,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that he was
                            very disturbed over the current state of Franco-American relations
                            which, in his view, were at an all time low. He attributed this in large
                            measure to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s unfortunate and inexplicable remarks on

                            there is a house near the Palace of Versailles, which was built by the

                            and might perhaps find his presence in the Western Hemisphere a good

                            and full of respect for the manner in which the President carries this

                            in the world. He told me that he thought from the military point of view
                            the Soviets could destroy the U.S. and the U.S. could destroy the
                            Soviets and that therefore from a purely military standpoint we
                            cancelled each other out. However, he said the U.S. was so much more
                            powerful from the economic and financial point of view as well as in
                            organization of its state that there was no comparison. I pointed out to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> that the Soviet
                            Union, having a closed system, was in no way affected financially by the
                            power of the U.S., to which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> replied that this may be so but that the U.S.

                        <p>I told him that I had been associated with the conduct of American
                            foreign policy for well over twenty years and I could really think of no
                            case where the U.S. had sought to use its power for its own selfish
                            ends. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he did not
                            accuse the U.S. of any belligerent attitude although he thought it was
                            “inevitable” that so much power as that possessed
                            by the U.S. sooner or later—perhaps not now he
                            said—would begin to influence the policy and conduct of any
                            country.</p>

                            say the least to see the head of an important and traditionally friendly
                            country conduct its foreign policy on such a series of subjective and
                            relatively trivial prejudices as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> seems to be doing in France. It seems to me that
                            his anger and bitterness in regard to Israel stems from two basic
                            reasons: (1) His recognition that France did not and could not play any
                            important role in the Middle East crisis—Russia's
                            blunt refusal of a Four-Power gathering, the failure of French diplomacy
                            with its former African colonies set the background for his current
                            mood. (2) His anger at the Israelis daring to ignore his personal advice
                            adds a note of subjective bitterness. To his present mood (3) it should
                            of course be added that as is customary with him he finds some reason to
                            blame the U.S. His supposition, and it is certainly no more than that,
                            that if the U.S. had really given a flat warning to Israel we could have
                            prevented the war is ridiculous on the face of it. What is a matter of
                            concern however is the degree to which under <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s one-man rule personal and
                            subjective prejudices have been translated into political action. As an
                            illustration of the depth of his feeling against Israel he told me
                            yesterday that “in this very room” five years ago
                            Ben Gurion said that Israel had two and one-half million people, that
                            some day it would be five million, and then asked the rhetorical
                            question “Where will we put these people,” the
                            implication being that Israel had solid reasons for making plans of
                            aggression. I told him that this may have been Ben Gurion's
                            view five years ago, but I understood that recently the rate of
                            immigration to Israel had gone down radically.</p>
                        <p>At another point in discussing the motivations of Israeli action I said
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, “What
                            would you have done if you had been an Israeli” to which he
                            replied with some frostiness, “I am not an
                            Israeli.” (I might say that throughout <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was as usual polite and
                            courteous.)</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to believe however that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s statement that French abstention on
                            Cuban and Albanian amendments was due to his feeling that the U.S. bore
                            some share of responsibility for events in the <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0180"/>Middle East is not completely accurate.
                            I had learned yesterday from an officer of the Quai d'Orsay
                            that these instructions were drafted on a general basis without any
                            anticipation of either of these amendments, and that Seydoux had lacked
                            the nerve to raise the question with the Quai. It was for this reason
                            that I suggested we be particularly careful in handling what <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> told me.</p>
                        <p>There would seem to be absolutely nothing that we can do to bring about
                            any change in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s attitude, and I believe that we can count
                            on his continuing hostility to Israel, particularly in the field of the
                            arms embargo, unless the Israelis should withdraw, which is in the
                            highest degree unlikely.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to convey from here to Washington the depth of the
                            feeling in Parisian political and non-political circles at the current
                            line of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            policy. However, with the Assembly in recess until October there is no
                            chance that any influence will be brought to bear on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, or would have any
                            possibility of success if it were. There seems to be no possibility of
                            any ministerial resignation, but there is no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s Middle East
                            policy, particularly the anti-Israeli aspect, has dealt Gaullism a
                            considerable blow.</p>

                                Gaulle</persName> these days. When <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0181"/>asked by a somewhat flustered <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> for specifics, I cited such issues
                            as the Middle East, Viet-Nam, international monetary problems and even
                            the “Anglo-Saxon” question of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into Europe where French policy was
                            directed against the United States. When I mentioned our sadness over
                            the state of our relations, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName>
                            said that his visits to Rhode Island, Kentucky and Minnesota during the
                            last few days had convinced him there was still some permanent
                            friendship left. I agreed but commented that the unfortunate state of
                            our relations gives some impetus to isolationism here in the United
                            States. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> agreed with this,
                            and concluded with the comment that “You're fed up
                            with all of us, but you cannot get rid of us.” I laughingly
                            replied: “We can always try.”</p>
                        <p>3. In a subsequent discussion of this part of the conversation with
                            Anderson (FBX) <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said that he
                            understood and personally shared my views, that he welcomed having them,
                            and that he intended to use them in Paris to try to obtain some
                            “clarification” of French policy towards the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p>1288. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has always been
                            known as a man of strong and definite views, which he has had no
                            inhibitions in expressing. However, along with this, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> up until recently had always
                            had a sense of measure, of timing, of place and appropriateness. It has
                            now become increasingly apparent that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has lost this sense of timing and of
                            appropriateness and his public utterances and indeed actions have more
                            and more taken on a purely willful and personal character. According to
                            our information, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            conducts completely single-handedly French foreign policy and is more
                            and more neglecting other aspects of government activities. His
                            statements on Vietnam, which have tended more and more to free himself
                            from the normal restraints, his action on the Common Market, and
                            finally, the recent and most incredible <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0182"/>of all, his behavior in Canada,<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> visited Montreal
                                July 23-26. In the course of a speech at Montreal City Hall, July
                                24, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> repeated the
                                rally cry of the Separatists, “Vive le Quebec
                                Libre.” In a statement issued after the second speech,
                                the Government of Canada called <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                            tendency. It would seem that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> is suffering from two aspects of old age: (1) A
                            progressive hardening of the prejudices—of which he had
                            plenty, and (2) A growing indifference and even unconcern with the
                            effect of his words on international and French public opinion. The
                            fixation which he has always had in regard to the power and size of the
                            United States has grown into a compulsive obsession.</p>
                        <p>I have always held the view, and still do, that basically and originally
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            antagonism to the United States was based upon his view of our size and
                            power, coupled with the traditional friendliness of the United States
                            towards France. These, in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s view, constituted the chief elements
                            of a power which was dangerous in regard to the independence of French
                            action. However, as I recently reported (Paris 808),<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">Dated July 18. (National Archives and Records
                                Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files
                                1967-69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> FR-US)</note> an
                            attitude, whatever its original motivation, if consistently held and
                            acted upon eventually becomes a subjective obsession. This is clear now
                            in the case of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s view of the United States. We have noted
                            that along with his powerful intrusion into Canadian domestic affairs in
                            favor of the French Canadians, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> found two occasions to make relatively mild cracks
                            about the United States and its size. I feel, however, that now we must
                            definitely recognize that one of the motivating forces of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s conduct of
                            foreign policy is his anti-American obsession and I believe that we can
                            expect that almost anything he says in the future will contain some
                            uncomplimentary references toward United States. His performance in
                            Canada has come as a disturbing and unsettling shock to French public
                            opinion. Virtually the entire press has been openly and severely
                            critical of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> personally.
                            Characteristic of this tone is an editorial in Figaro this morning which
                            after criticizing <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> very
                            severely, ends up with “why"? The prevailing mood among such
                            French as can be met in Paris at this season is one of incredulity and
                            humiliation because <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has
                            violated what the French regard as one of their chief attributes, namely
                            that of good taste. Also, no one here can understand exactly what
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> was driving at. </p>
                        <p>Naturally it is the effect on the French domestic political scene which
                            will be of chief interest. In all probability there will be more
                            reaction than action during August when everyone, including all members
                            of the government, will be on vacation, and it is yet too soon to state
                            exactly what effect the Canadian fiasco will eventually have on <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0183"/>the domestic scene. However,
                            together with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s policy on the Middle East, the Canadian
                            fiasco will be one more major error of de Gaulle in the general picture.
                            It is to be assumed that even the most hardened Gaullists must be left
                            with a sensation of frustration and bewilderment. It is perhaps too soon
                            to state that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is
                            “becoming senile,” but certainly the restraint
                            which used to accompany his actions and characterize his words seems to
                            be slipping very badly.</p>

                            discussion:</p>
                        <p>After my telling <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> how much
                            I personally regretted leaving Paris and how appreciative I was of the
                            many acts of kindness and consideration I had received from him and from
                            other members of the French Govt, I told him that insofar as official
                            matters were concerned I was very sorry to see the present state of
                            Franco-American relations and that I honestly did not feel that it was
                            due to anything that the U.S. Govt had done or not done, leaving aside
                            Vietnam which of course did not touch any direct French interest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> did not disagree with me
                            but said that Vietnam, while not affecting French interests directly
                            nevertheless was a larger question affecting almost every country in the
                            world. I told him Vietnam was a widely complicated subject but he could
                            be sure that no one wished to find a reasonable and decent solution more
                            than the U.S. and I thought he would find more interest among the
                            oriental countries in what the U.S. was trying to do there. I then went
                            on to tell him that I couldn't honestly foresee any great
                            improvement, even if Vietnam was settled, in the relations between the
                            U.S. and France, and one of the reasons was that I felt the attitude of
                            the French Govt, including <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0184"/>that
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, was obsessed with
                            the power of the U.S., particularly economically and financially; that
                            their attitude, particularly the General's, was that nothing
                            could be done about it and that it was inevitable that sooner or later
                            the U.S. would develop all the character and action of a country with
                            too much power. In the circumstances I could not see—since
                            obviously we could do nothing to diminish our power—how there
                            could be any genuine improvement in our relationship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> said that no one expected
                            the U.S. to do anything to diminish its power but the manner in which
                            the power was used might be important. I said there were certain limits
                            in regard to the use of power which would apply in any nation and I
                            frankly did not see—again leaving aside Vietnam—in
                            what manner the U.S. could have applied its powers more benignly than it
                            had. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> replied that this
                            might be true from the point of view of the govt but that speaking from
                            his experience in private business he felt that the action of American
                            companies was very calculated and assertive, mentioning particularly the
                            aviation business in which he said that every time France or England
                            attempted sales in other countries they ran into overriding competition
                            from American firms. I pointed out to him as a general rule the U.S.
                            Govt practically never got into these matters involving these companies,
                            which I did not think was always the case in France.</p>
                        <p>I then told <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> that I had
                            been very much disturbed at the state of public opinion in the U.S. in
                            regard to France: that I thought this was in part due to the simple fact
                            that the American public did not understand many of the foreign policy
                            acts of the French Govt and I also said that the attitude of the General
                            toward Israel and in his last press conference apparently toward the

                            mentioned that the French position in the Middle East was by no means
                            clear to many people and that it was matters of this kind, including of
                            course the departure from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the
                            establishment of which I personally recalled had been very much a French

                            easy to interpret as anti-American.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> then asked me whether I
                            really seriously thought that if President Johnson had wanted to use his
                            full influence with Israel there would have been any war (in this he was
                            parroting <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            attitude, Paris 3931).<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">Not found.</note> I
                            told him from everything that I knew, both from personal conversations
                            in Washington and from the documents in the case, it seemed entirely
                            clear that President Johnson had gone just as <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0185"/>far as it was conceivable to go in an
                            attempt to dissuade the Israelis, pointing out that there was a limit
                            beyond which you could not go in dealing with a smaller country.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> made no reply.</p>
                        <p>In turning to the recent American balance of payment measures <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> said approaching this from an
                            economic point of view it seemed perfectly clear to him that we were
                            taking measures which would not be unpalatable to American public
                            opinion in an election year but were perhaps somewhat more indifferent
                            towards the interests of others. I said that I frankly didn't
                            agree with this observation since many of the measures undertaken would
                            not be a bit palatable to American business, American tourists, or other
                            elements in American life. I pointed out to him that insofar as the
                            interests of others was concerned there was no discrimination involving
                            any other country despite what he, <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName>, had said on television. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> said he did not use the word
                            discrimination and did not mean to imply it (sic), but had merely
                            pointed out that since there was a difference of treatment towards Great
                            Britain and the European countries it was obvious the U.S. did not
                            consider England a European country. I told him I thought if England had
                            been admitted to the Common Market and had really meshed its finances
                            with other Common Market countries, the result might have been
                            different, but in the circumstances there could hardly be any question
                            since England was in balance of payments difficulties whereas Common
                            Market countries were not.</p>
                        <p>After some more discussion of “hegemony” as applied
                            to the modern world the conversation ended with mutual compliment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I have always known that <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> was one of those who more
                            strongly believed in the overwhelming power of the U.S.
                            vis-á-visothers and the expressions along this line noted
                            above were not a bit out of character, but I think are generally held by
                            most of the French Govt. He did not disagree when I mentioned that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            remarks on the Jews had created a reaction, possibly for the reason that
                            they created an equally strong reaction in France. It was interesting to
                            note that he did not disagree with my statement that in the
                            circumstances I foresaw very little chance of any basic change in

                                May 2 French authorities closed the University of Paris complex at
                                Nanterres, a Paris suburb, setting off a growing wave of student
                                demonstrations that erupted into violence on May 6. The clashes
                                between police and students continued until May 13 when French
                                workers staged a massive general strike in support of the students.
                                On May 14 the students occupied the Sorbonne. Other faculty
                                occupations followed. By May 17 workers in many parts of France were
                                occupying factories as part of a protest against government economic
                                policies. By May 21 when the French National Assembly began debates
                                on the uprising, an estimated 8 million workers were striking,
                                paralyzing industry and transportation.</note>

                            DeGaulle can probably defeat a vote of censure in the French Assembly.
                            His TV speech on Friday was tough, but it did offer a compromise to his
                            opponents. He may well emerge as the leader who overcame current
                            disturbances. If he has to use force to end disorder, he will encounter
                            very serious problems. It is in our interest to have the situation in
                            France calm down.</p>

                        <p>14914. Subject: Possible Effects of Present Crisis on French Foreign
                            Policy.</p>
                        <p>1. Taking step back from immediate urgencies, some very preliminary
                            observations are in order on possible effect of this crisis on
                            Franco-American relations and on French foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>2. This Embassy has commented many times that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s overriding concern was
                            reasserting his country's independence and increasing its
                            international standing. Many Frenchmen now recognize that his
                            preoccupation with French prestige has been a basic cause of his neglect
                            of domestic concerns that helped bring on present situation. We have
                            also noted often that his aims overreached his means, and that such
                            diplomatic successes as he enjoyed were result not of French power but
                            of his unique personal authority and audacity, coupled with image of
                            French prosperity and stability.</p>
                        <p>3. Whatever the outcome of present trials, it already is clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            authority in France will be significantly reduced, and that his standing
                            and France's leverage in the international area will be
                            considerably diminished. Whoever governs, there will be turning inward
                            toward domestic concerns, less temptation to attempt policies based on
                            grandeur. Even on material level, economic implications of strikes and
                            their settlement (see Paris 14553 for early estimation)<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">Telegram 14553 from Paris, May 22, commented on the
                                economic impact of the French strikes. (Ibid., E 9 FR)</note> will
                            reduce material resources available for conduct of foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>4. How all this will affect specific French policies is more difficult to
                            say, for it depends on how firmly <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> remains in saddle or, if he is unseated, who comes
                            after. Since past French diplomatic adventures—whether
                            shaking the Alliance, rapproching with the East, comforting our enemies
                            in Vietnam, intervening in Canada, blocking Britain from Europe, or the
                            rest—have issued directly from the General's
                            personal initiative [and] prestige, it seems certain that no French
                            leader—even <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>—will enjoy same prestige after this crisis
                            and act the <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0188"/>same. Using working
                            hypothesis that Gaullists will stay in power after June 16, some
                            possibilities might be outlined:</p>
                        <p>(A) The old <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> might well
                            have taken France out of Atlantic Alliance in 1969; a post-crisis
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would not feel
                            strong enough at home to risk such an unsettling move, at least in
                            foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>(B) France's political and economic relations with ITU
                            partners in Common Market are open to question. With <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s domestic
                            standing reduced and adverse effect of strike-settling reforms at work,
                            France cannot be as arbitrary and carry same weight in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Councils as before. (See Paris
                                14173.)<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Not found.</note> Conversely
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> partners might show more force
                            and determination against French arbitrariness; Bonc may have less
                            concern and respect for French leadership in the future.</p>
                        <p>(C) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            rapprochement with Moscow has never caught imagination of most
                            Frenchmen, and in view Communist role in present crisis, a weakened
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or successor
                            “Gaullist” government might fear too much
                            “opening to East” which may have brought more
                            trouble than benefit to France.</p>
                        <p>(D) France's cherished image as hero of Third World and

                        <p>(E) Even <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            firm pro-Arab stance in Middle East could conceivably be modified should
                            he need more powerful anti-Communist friends in the West.</p>
                        <p>(F) As for Franco-American relations, it is evident that
                            France's internal problems should encourage any tendencies
                            already at work for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to
                            ease off on his anti-American posture. He is obviously flattered by
                            Vietnam talks going on in Paris, and in any event has less reason to
                            criticize US about Vietnam. Domestic economic repercussions should spoil
                            French favorite game of criticizing US payments problem; and in general
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> must have need for
                            better relations with US to bolster his reputation at home. This is
                            particularly true since most Frenchmen seem tired of bad relations with
                            US and many of them are increasingly worried about policy of going it
                            alone in a world which <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0189"/>has
                            suddenly become more dangerous. (We cite for sheer pleasure what one
                            Embassy officer's concierge told him she was telling her
                            friends: “I wish the US troops would come back; they gave us
                            some security.”)</p>
                        <p>5. We emphasize change not discontinuity (if Gaullists stay in). We must
                            recognize, for example, that return to the old solidarity within
                            Atlantic Alliance is probably impossible in absence of Soviet military
                            threats and that a certain degree of mistrust and jealousy of the US is
                            standard part of French outlook. France, however, may be returning to
                            reality; important, as is her due, but not the false, inflated,
                            imperious France that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            has sought. France is returning to France—which is a great
                            deal, and is all her friends ask.</p>
                        <p>6. We believe the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can take pride in
                            consistent US policy of restraint and abstinence from controversy with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. We have not
                            replied in kind, we have not taken steps against French interests, we
                            have kept the hand out. We are ready to work with her again, as
                            before.</p>
                        <p>7. Embassy assessment of effect on US interests should Gaullists lose
                            power entirely to center and/or left (including Popular Front with
                            Communists) will follow in subsequent telegram. This is even tougher
                            exercise since opposition leadership is full of holes and the future
                            full of unknowns. However, it is even more important since what was
                            almost inconceivable a month ago, i.e. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s early departure, would now be an even
                            bet if France were asked today.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            Challenge</p>
                        <p>1. The events of the last 24 hours have placed France on the knife edge
                            of disaster. By refusing to resign, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has taken on the workers <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0190"/>and students frontally. He has reverted
                            to type, the powerful, challenging autocrat. He has promised elections
                            for the Assembly, not for the presidency. He has vowed to retain his
                            prime minister. He has threatened the use of his emergency powers. He
                            has asked for the revival of Gaullist “civic
                            action” committees—his private security system. He
                            has raised the spectre of a Communist takeover. In short, he has come
                            out of his corner swinging defiantly at opponents who thought that they
                            had him on the ropes.</p>
                        <p>2. In his speech he made a simplistic division of France into those
                            threatening dictatorship-his opponents, all lumped together as
                            Communists or their dupes—and those in favor of
                            “progress, independence, and peace"—the people. De
                            Gaulle is attempting to achieve by words what his regime has failed to
                            do politically, i.e., divide the country into two clear-cut camps: the
                            Gaullists and their supporters on the one hand and the Communists and
                            theirs on the other. This attempt poses basic problems of strategy and
                            tactics for the leftist opposition and its electoral ally, the Communist
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>3. The immediate reaction has been both angry, and enthusiastic. On the
                            one hand, more workers have left their jobs, including some public
                            service employees; on the other hand, thousands of Gaullists are
                            jubilantly taking to the streets. When, how, and if a head-on collision
                            between right and left will occur is not yet clear, but a spark could
                            set it off.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Opposition's Response</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            challenge could evoke a wide range of responses from French workers,
                            students, and the political parties of the left. Among the workers, a
                            small but militant and youthful minority has led both the mass of
                            workers and the opposition political parties in fomenting strikes and
                            forcing the French economy to a standstill. These militants are unlikely
                            to change their tactics now.</p>
                        <p>5. In an effort to force <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s resignation, workers could carry their
                            activities to new levels by cutting off all electricity and gas service
                            (they have done so for short periods already), and they could attempt
                            large-scale industrial sabotage in installations that they now either
                            occupy or have struck. In such circumstances <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would be obliged to restore the operation of
                            these installations by force.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> obviously hopes that
                            the great majority of the ten million striking workers who follow but do
                            not lead will get back on the job now that they are threatened with the
                            full power of the government. If the labor force does begin returning to
                            work in significant numbers, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> will have broken the back of the dissidence. If it
                            does not, civil conflict of major proportions will almost certainly
                            ensue.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>7. If <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> gets more workers
                            back on the job and the economy moving again, he will have largely
                            isolated the students. He can then deal with them at greater leisure and
                            from a much stronger position. The students who instigated the early
                            demonstrations and who are still in the revolutionary forefront must
                            realize this, and probably see only one course open to them: to continue
                            the resistance by all means and to persuade the workers over the heads
                            of their own leaders that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> can be defeated. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s arrogant speech could lead to a
                            hardening of the student position and to more dramatic attempts to
                            challenge authority.</p>
                        <p>8. For the political parties of the left—the Communist and
                            Francois Mitterrand's Left Federation—<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s speech poses
                            more starkly than ever the dilemma they have faced since the crisis
                            began. Will they gain (or lose) more by trying to assume leadership of
                            the revolution against <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                            or by strengthening their own moderate image through support of order
                            and peaceful change? The immediate reaction of both Mitterrand and the
                            Communist leadership to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s speech was to label it a call to civil
                            war. They may have second thoughts, but apparently now believe that they
                            would lose more by knuckling under to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> than by fully associating themselves with the
                            dissidents. The left's political leaders themselves are
                            dependent on the workers. If substantial numbers of workers respond to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and begin returning
                            to work in the next few days, the politicians of the left will also
                            probably pull in their horns, seek to cut their losses, and begin again
                            to espouse order and parliamentary processes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s Assets</p>
                        <p>9. At this juncture <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has
                            one asset that he almost certainly can count on—the army; one
                            asset that he probably can rely on—the internal security
                            forces; and one potential asset—the nonstriking, nonstudent
                            French public which would like to avoid bloodshed and possible civil
                            war. The position of the army is particularly critical if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> assumes emergency powers
                            under Article 16 of the constitution, a move that he
                            alone—and with only a pro forma parliamentary and judicial
                            sanction—can initiate.</p>
                        <p>10. The army probably will obey any orders it receives from the legally
                            constituted government. If an insurrection breaks out and the army is
                            ordered to crush it, it probably will do so. Purges that have occurred
                            since the Algerian imbroglio and the anti-Communist sentiment among army
                            leaders should ensure the loyalty of the officer corps. The reaction of
                            the conscripts if massive violence breaks out is less predictable,
                            although most officers do not seem concerned about the loyalty of the
                            draftees. Various reports indicate that on his way back to Colombey on
                            the 29th, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> met in
                            eastern France with General Jacques Massu, <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0192"/>commanding general of the French forces in West
                            Germany, and with a number of other army leaders, presumably to inquire
                            about the loyalty of the troops. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s implicit threat to use force to
                            restore order indicates the generals probably reaffirmed their support
                            for the regime in case of a showdown. There are numerous reports that
                            additional troops are now moving toward the Paris area, but there has
                            been no confirmation of this.</p>
                        <p>11. As of 29 May, two airborne regiments had been moved closer to Paris
                            and three armored units near Paris had been placed on a six-hour alert.
                            In addition, five gendarmerie companies from the French forces in
                            Germany had been moved to Strasbourg and Paris and all major units of
                            the First Military Region, which has its headquarters in Paris, were
                            ordered to have 75 percent of their personnel present at all times.</p>
                        <p>12. The police, aided by the 60,000-man gendarmerie and the Republic
                            Security Companies (CRS), have up to this point obeyed all orders issued
                            by their superiors. Discontent among the Paris police has been growing,
                            however, in part over the regime's handling of the crisis and
                            in part because the government has not yet responded to demands for pay
                            raises. Police unions have publicly proclaimed their sympathy with
                            striking workers and might balk if ordered to oust strikers from
                            occupied factories. De Gaulle thus might be forced to rely on the CRS
                            and the army. He has studiously avoided calling on the army up to this
                            point, possibly in part because few units have been trained to deal with
                            civic disorder.</p>
                        <p>13. The public thus far has been highly critical of the
                            “establishment” and surprisingly tolerant of
                            lawbreakers, strikes, and massive inconveniences. Now that the
                            possibility exists of an insurrection on the part of the protesters and
                            the wholesale use of force by the government to restore order, that
                            sector of the public which wants to avoid a civil war might rally to the
                            legitimate government. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s raising of the spectre of a Communist
                            take-over probably was intended to arouse this up-to-now passive group.
                            Some indications that he has considerable strength within this group in
                            the Paris area have already been shown by the 300,000-400,000
                            demonstrators who gathered in Paris late today in support of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outlook</p>
                        <p>14. Developments over the next few hours and days will tell whether the
                            momentum of the dissidents is sustained—or whether <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s opening for a
                            return to order is seized by a tired and frightened public. Movement to
                            chaos could be very fast indeed, particularly if some of the restraints
                            observed so far by organized labor are abandoned. The critical areas are
                            the public utilities, communications, and the police.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0193"/>
                        <p>15. The leaders of the left may upon reflection recoil from attempting to
                            come to power the same way <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> did in 1958: through subversion and paralysis of
                            the state. The events of the past three weeks, however, demonstrate that
                            the titular leaders of both workers and students have only imperfect
                            control over the rank and file in their organizations. It is highly
                            questionable now whether they have the will or indeed the desire to
                            rally their followers for a legal assault on the Gaullist regime at the
                            ballot box.</p>
                        <p>16. Whether elections will be held, whether the results will be
                            meaningful, and whether the losers will accept the results of the vote
                            probably will not be apparent for a week or more. The immediate reaction
                            of the leaders of the leftist opposition, the striking unions, and the
                            demonstrating students indicates that they have chosen to regard
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s speech
                            as a “call to civil war” rather than as an
                            opportunity to prove that a majority of the French people desires the
                            end of the Gaullist regime.</p>
                        <p>17. The immediate outlook for a return to some measure of calm is very
                            poor. The government already has begun organizing counterdemonstrations
                            and mobilizing the Committee for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) a
                            group of World War II resistance veterans unconditionally faithful to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. If students
                            continue to demonstrate and workers to occupy plants, or if the
                            Communist Party activates its own “action
                            committees,” then bloody clashes are likely with the CDR,
                            other Gaullist supporters, the police, and the army. Over the short run,
                            we believe that the government probably would succeed in restoring order
                            and essential services, but only at the cost of poisoning political life
                            for the indefinite future.</p>
                        <p>18. The longer term political outlook is therefore ominous. The Gaullists
                            have repeatedly violated and perverted their own constitution. They have
                            treated even the moderate opposition with disdain and indifference. In
                            today's declaration, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has reasserted his determination to maintain the
                            dominance of the right in France. The opposition, in turn, has reacted
                            in its political frustration with revolutionary language and calls for
                            extraparliamentary means to redress its grievances. Long-term political
                            stability in France probably has been undermined. Thus the stage has
                            been set for a polarization of political forces in France, with neither
                            extreme willing to accept the role of a “loyal”
                            opposition. Whatever the short-term outcome, France faces a period of
                            unrest and, eventually, even civil war.</p>

                        <p>18701. Secun 17. For the Secretary from the Under Secretary. Amb.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName> and I saw Foreign
                            Minister Debre for 1/2 hour meeting this evening.</p>
                        <p>Debre stated the French Economy Minister said he thought there would be
                            serious difficulties for the remainder of this year, but that things
                            would pick up around January and continue on an upward course. He said
                            his technicians thought this view somewhat pessimistic and that the
                            upturn would come sooner.</p>
                        <p>In response to my question on his view as to Czech, the Minister said
                            that it was absolutely impossible for the Soviet Union to accept the
                            course of liberalization in Czech because if this continued it would
                            affect all other Eastern European countries and prove to be
                            irreversible. He did not think that it would be possible to reverse this
                            course in Czech, other than by force. He thought the Soviets were
                            prepared to do this. He said it was conceivable, but unlikely, that
                            Dubcek could avert the crisis by making major concessions to the
                            Soviets. He would have to promise to exercise strict press censorship,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>At one point in the conversation he said that he did not think his view
                            different from that expressed by Bohlen as reported by <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName>. I said I thought he took a more
                            pessimistic view. Debre said that Soviet intervention would be tragic
                            for Europe but there was nothing anybody could do about it.</p>

                        <p>Attached is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s memo requesting approval to initiate talks
                            with the French on compensation for losses we incurred when we had to
                            move our military installations out of France.<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Not printed.</note> Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> join in this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>These claims cover:</p>
                        <p>—the estimated value of the remaining useful life of the
                            facilities we left in France; plus</p>
                        <p>—certain moving costs involved in the relocation.</p>
                        <p>State estimates the total at $230-$250 million.</p>
                        <p>Our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies may be willing to share
                            certain of these relocation costs with us (up to a maximum of $96
                            million). They expect repayment in proportion to any compensation we
                            might ultimately receive from France. They expect us to bring our
                            bilateral claim to France before they begin negotiations with us to
                            share in our costs.</p>
                        <p>In addition to our bilateral claims, we share in the combined <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> financial claims against France for
                            similar costs on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-financed
                            facilities. The Fourteen invited the French to begin discussions on this
                            issue in February but so far received only a stalling response.</p>
                        <p>Asking the French to begin discussions on our bilateral claim may look
                            like provoking a U.S.-French confrontation. The French response will
                            probably amount to a stall or a brush-off. But we do have a legitimate
                            claim and we will be subject to Congressional criticism if we delay
                            presenting it. To take both factors into account, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is recommending a low-key approach
                            (along the lines of the attached draft note), with no public
                            statement.</p>

                        <p>2. In defending his policy, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> has fallen back on shopworn theme of attacking
                            “both hegemonies” and has attributed events in
                            Czechoslovakia to divisive policy of blocs. While French public opinion
                            is far more condemnatory of Soviets than GOF statements, on issue like
                            this <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is not susceptible
                            to pressure from his countrymen. Similarly while there is considerable
                            opinion within <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> favoring closer
                            cooperation with United States, this sentiment will not any more than in
                            past induce <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to change
                            his position publicly or privately. Thus we should not be surprised to
                            hear at his Sept 9 press conference further restatement of his
                            philosophy, again balancing criticism of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with criticism of US.</p>
                        <p>3. What does <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> now intend
                            to do in East-West relations? He is obviously determined not to burn his
                            bridges with Moscow and other occupying powers. We therefore do not
                            believe <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> will sever economic,
                            scientific and cultural relations it has built up. Rather, <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> will put brakes on more political and
                            psychological projects with these <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0197"/>countries—e.g., cancellation Gomulka visit.
                            But there is no question of <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>
                            withdrawing its support for Czech independence or its condemnation of
                            Soviet actions.</p>
                        <p>4. Re actions in concert with US or within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework, we believe <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> considers <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            totally irrelevant to finding solution to situation, and doubt he would
                            let France become enmeshed in any common action with US. In this
                            connection, final two paragraphs of Aug 24 communiquéof
                            Council of Ministers (COM) meeting should be read in this context.
                            (Paris 19905)<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Telegram 19905 from Paris,
                                August 24, reported the text of a French statement regarding the
                                Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27-1 COMM BLOC-CZECH)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. While many Frenchmen believe swift Soviet incursion into
                            Czechoslovakia and presence of Soviet troops on Bavarian frontier
                            reemphasizes importance of Atlantic Alliance, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may think otherwise. One
                            question is whether <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>,
                            during his Sept. 9th Delphic oration, might indicate France's
                            intention to withdraw from Alliance. Opinion thus far indicates he will
                            not. Foccart of Elysee and Quai State Secretary de Lipkowski told us
                            subsequent to Aug. 24 COM session that in their view there is no
                            question of France leaving Alliance. Case could be made for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to take this action if he
                            determines pressures may be underway to make Alliance focal point for
                            dealing with EE situation. He has strongly condemned what he describes
                            as two-bloc approach to foreign affairs: he favors disappearance of both
                            blocs. On Sept 9 he could refer to his March 7, 1966 letter to President
                            pointing out that events have now changed fundamental elements of
                            relations between East and West, that cold war Alliance approach has
                            been responsible for these tragic events, and that therefore, in the
                            interest of promoting peace in Europe, France must free itself from
                            “the servitudes” brought about by belonging to one
                            of blocs.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">For text of the letter, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1966</hi>, p. 318.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. On balance, we believe it unlikely <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> will make this move, when situation in
                            Czechoslovakia is far from settled and there are apprehensions regarding
                            further Soviet moves. We also recall that earlier he told Brosio and
                            others that question would not arise in 1968. There is really little
                            that France can do to deter the Soviets, and getting out of the Alliance
                            at this time would only benefit Moscow; there is no internal threat to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> or his
                            government's position by stand he has already taken;
                            membership in Alliance has not prevented France from pursuing
                            independent policy; to turn France neutralist when faced with serious
                            domestic problems might be another headache General would prefer not to
                            have. These arguments are conclusive to us, but we must add caveat that
                            de Gaulle has done the unexpected more than once in past.</p>

                        <p>7. As for impact of Czechoslovak intervention on France-US relations, we
                            remain encouraged by increased cooperation shown at all levels below
                            Elysee. Debre's frank discussion with me immediately after
                            return from Colombey on first day of crisis; statements from many French
                            Ministers and civil servants about desire to work together; reports by
                            both <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and Defense Attaché
                            that working level cooperation during Czech crisis has been
                            remarkable—all these we take as hopeful signs. We should
                            continue to consult with French whenever possible and cooperate more
                            closely in those areas where Elysee is not set in concrete.</p>
                        <p>8. We believe that analysis in Paris telegrams 18471 and 18627<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">Telegram 18471 from Paris, July 24, commented on the
                                state of U.S.-French relations. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> FR-US) Telegram 18627 from Paris, July 26, analyzed
                                the post-crisis outlook for French foreign policy. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 FR)</note> remains sound, and
                            that Czech crisis is reinforcing pressures towards greater cooperation
                            among Western Allies and towards building warmer Franco-US atmosphere.
                            Fact remains that <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss>'s
                            position internally and externally was weakened by May-June French
                            crisis. De-emphasis of rapprochement with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, already underway, is now likely to continue. This
                            does not mean that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> will
                            “re-enter <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,”

                            they have in past—more negative than positive because of
                            France's power position in the world.</p>

                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>1. In mid-summer we reported several straws in the wind blowing in the
                            direction of somewhat improved Franco-American relations. We observed
                            (Paris 18471)<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d83fn4">footnote 4, Document 83</ref>.</note> that although there were
                            no basic changes in French foreign policy, one result of the May events
                            had been improved atmosphere of our bilateral relations. Since then,
                            Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has intervened. Some thought this
                            would lead de Gaulle to consider closer military and political
                            cooperation for the sake of Western collective security; in contrast
                            this demonstration of raw Soviet power apparently confirmed the General
                            even more in his determination to work against Western political and
                            military unity and “against blocs.”</p>
                        <p>2. What then remains of the hopes of July in this Indian summer of
                            political uncertainty? In our view, there remains something quite
                            important, even if intangible and perhaps fragile—namely the
                            improved atmosphere. This has two aspects, present and future. For the
                            present, one principal reason for this improved atmosphere is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> does not want
                            acutely unpleasant relations with US. This attitude is not due to any
                            change of heart, but rather, we believe, to his recognition that with
                            Soviets on warpath this is not time to be feuding with US. In other
                            words, this is implicit recognition of elements of weakness in his
                            international posture, especially now with Soviets occupying
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>3. How does the improved atmosphere still show? By: (A) The continuing
                            absence of the former snarling anti-American quality of statements by
                            French leaders—at least in public—and despite such
                            vitriolic statements by the rather emotional Debre, as reported by Luns
                            (The Hague's 7316).<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Telegram 7316

                            better tone is due to France's role as host to the Vietnam
                            negotiations and part may be due to the evident unpopularity of
                            “way out” anti-US rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>(B) The continuing desire of French Government officials below the top
                            for closer communication with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            and at the top for the first time in two years the visit of a French
                            Foreign Minister to Washington. This should not be considered as too
                            important in our view. At the working level at the Quai, the new
                            friendliness, greater openness and cooperation has been continued and
                            even developed somewhat.</p>
                        <p>(C) For the first time in years, the granting by <gloss target="#t_ORTF1">ORTF</gloss> of coverage in depth to the activities of our
                            Ambassador. <gloss target="#t_ORTF1">ORTF</gloss> even ran his entire
                            speech given at the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of
                            St. Mihiel and today <gloss target="#t_ORTF1">ORTF</gloss>s presentation
                            of feature of <persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName> family.
                            This is a relatively minor although much noted gesture and again, this
                            may in part be a personal gesture to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>(D) Closer cooperation and coordination in intelligence and security
                            affairs has continued to develop in a satisfactory way. This is
                            important to US and to the French.</p>
                        <p>4. The future aspect of improved atmosphere is that for some French
                            politicians at least the “pre-post-<persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>” period has begun,
                            despite the General's absolute hold on power right now. New
                            leaders are preparing themselves for the re-ordering of French political
                            life after <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, and while
                            French independence remains a cardinal article of faith, we do not
                            believe most of them share <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De

                        <p>Debre recalled with pleasure receiving the President several years ago in
                            Paris when Debre was French Prime Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">Vice President Johnson visited Paris on April 6, 1961, to
                                participate in ceremonies marking <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s 10th Anniversary.</note> The
                            President replied that he would always be grateful for the opportunity
                            that this meeting had afforded him. After saying how touched he was by
                            the President's receiving him today, Debre stated that no
                            matter what the difficulties that develop from time to time in our
                            relations, the President could be assured that his actions would leave
                            an important mark on the history of the United States and of the whole
                            world. Mr. Johnson had been President, Debre continued, during one of
                            the most difficult periods since the end of the last war. Those who are
                            attached to political equilibrium in the world know how much they owe to
                            the President. We are gong to continue to live in a difficult world.
                            However, the coordinated action of the West will help us to prevent the
                            worst from happening.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Intervention in Czechoslovakia</p>
                        <p>The whole of Europe was shaken by the Soviet intervention, Debre said,
                            and peoples' minds are troubled by it. Debre referred to his
                            discussion of the subject with the Secretary earlier in the week<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">October 4. Their discussions were reported in
                                telegram 6870 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, October 4.

                            satisfaction that the French Government's analysis of the
                            problem was similar to that of the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East</p>
                        <p>Debre mentioned that he had also talked to the Secretary about the Middle
                            East and expected to revert to the subject at the Secretary's
                            luncheon for him tomorrow.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Their talks were
                                summarized in telegram 259155 to Paris, October 21. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 FR)</note> In some ways, Debre
                            said, this area of the world will be the most pre-occupying for the
                            coming year. It would appear indispensable for the big powers to have a
                            common policy in this area to avoid any aggravation of the situation
                            which might create dangerous tension.</p>
                        <p>These are two areas (i.e., Europe and the Middle East), Debre commented,
                            where it is most useful for us to compare notes and coordinate our views
                            on a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>Debre said that he did not really need to speak of this problem. The
                            President's “very fine and very great
                            speech” of last March 31<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">For text,

                            Debre and others in his Ministry had been in regular contact with our
                            representatives in Paris. The French followed their patient efforts with
                            great interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Domestic Policy</p>
                        <p>Debre observed that the French have always followed US domestic policy
                            with great interest. The program of social renewal which the President
                            had inaugurated and which has been largely successful, Debre said, would
                            mark post-war American history. The President expressed a deep
                            appreciation for these remarks.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The President's Views on US-French
                            Relations</p>
                        <p>After recalling with pleasure and cordiality the time which Debre, as
                            Prime Minister, had given him during his visit to Paris, the President
                            said that he had come into office very much aware of the lack of
                            agreement between our two governments on some of the basic questions
                            confronting the peoples of the world. Despite this awareness, the
                            President had proceeded in the belief that in any crisis that threatened
                            the American people, France would always be with us. The President had
                            tried, therefore, to minimize our differences and disagreements and to
                            maintain the respect and affection for the French people in our country.
                            The President could not forget the many times the United States and
                            France had been shoulder to shoulder at the front, starting with the
                            birth of our nation down to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. This
                            awareness has helped him resist the temptation common to many leaders to
                            air disagreements in public. The President hoped that his successor
                            would find the bridge to traverse these differences so that our two
                            great nations could come closer together. The President deeply regretted
                            that he had not been able to do this.</p>
                        <p>The President fully realized that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> had very strong views on some of these divisive
                            subjects. The President thought, however, it was more important to have
                            an understanding of the situation than to get into public arguments.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had some
                            problems at home just as the President did in the United States.
                            Regardless of these various disagreements, the President said, he had
                            always recognized what France would be without General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. In a troubled period calling
                            for strong leadership, the General had provided it. The President
                            appreciated this, even though our two governments had not always gone
                            down the same road.</p>
                        <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0203"/>
                        <p>The President then referred to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRSJ1">Shriver</persName>'s reports confirming the
                            President's expectations that the Ambassador would have a
                            warm reception in France. The President also noted favorably the
                            Ambassador's hope that we could do more to improve our
                            relations. The President expressed appreciation for the great efforts by
                            the French people making it possible to conduct the Peace Talks in their
                            country. The President regretted that we do not see the Viet-Nam problem
                            in the same light but he had thought it best not to allow this
                            disagreement to inflame our relations. We could not go to Cambodia or
                            Poland for the talks, the President recalled, and recent events have
                            made even clearer why Poland was not feasible. It is a tribute to the
                            character of the French people, the President continued, that despite
                            their views on the Viet-Nam war, they made it possible for us to hold
                            the talks in their country. We have trusted in the fairness of the
                            French people, the President added, and we are still hopeful about the
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Debre commented that there was no doubt that for the duration of the
                            talks, the French Government would do what was necessary to assure a
                            propitious material, political, and intellectual atmosphere for
                            them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Launching Apollo 7</p>
                        <p>It was almost 11 o'clock and the President invited Mr. Debre
                            to watch the launching of Apollo 7 on the television. Debre said that it
                            was a “very great date,” and the President said
                            that it was good to have our French friends with us on the occasion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> Debre's Concluding Remarks</p>
                        <p>When the official conversation resumed, Debre emphasized that there would
                            never be the slightest difference between France and the United States
                            regarding fundamental matters. In the face of attempts to establish
                            dictatorship or other actions by forces hostile to liberty, France and
                            the United States would always stand side by side. It is natural, Debre
                            continued, that our interests and objectives do not always coincide, but
                            the great advantage of friendship is that we can speak freely to each
                            other. Debre reiterated that, during this visit to the United States, he
                            was General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s interpreter. He assured the President
                            that his action had always been highly appreciated by the French
                            Government. The latter regrets very much seeing him leave his huge
                            responsibilities and deplores his departure. “But you
                            leave,” Debre said, “with our total
                            admiration.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The President's Concluding Remarks</p>
                        <p>The President said he was grateful for these statements. He asked Mr.
                            Debre to express his gratitude for General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s help in connection with the Paris
                            Peace Talks. The President hoped that the Foreign <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0204"/>Minister would also convey to the
                            General the gratitude of the American people for the way the General had
                            treated the negotiations. The President also asked Mr. Debre to transmit
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> the depth of
                            the American people's feeling for France. The President was
                            sorry that he had not done as much as he wanted to bring our two
                            countries together, but he was convinced that he had done nothing to
                            push us farther apart. The President mentioned his keen desire to
                            revisit France after January 20. On his previous visits, he was obliged
                            to be in a hurry, so he was looking forward to seeing France under less
                            pressing circumstances. After January 20 he was never going to be in a
                            hurry again. The President noted that the problems of youth and
                            university turbulence are prominent in many countries, including ours,
                            and that as President, he had tried his best to cope with them. He
                            concluded that it would take a lot more than he has seen in his lifetime
                            to convince him that France and the United States would not always be
                            together.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Under Secretary Rostow called in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> today to offer some personal and unofficial
                            reflections on the trend of events in Europe, and particularly on the
                            political meaning of the recent meetings in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>Rostow said he had never been able to understand one aspect of French
                            European policy, namely the assumption that France could indefinitely
                            control or manage the Germans. As the Ambassador knew, we strongly
                            favored the Franco-German rapprochement, and tried never to do or say
                            anything to weaken it. That relationship was fundamental to any hope of
                            a European future. But to us the natural and <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0205"/>prudent way to organize Europe was on the foundation of
                            the Entente Cordiale, which we could support on the basis of parity from
                            the background, within a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> context. To Rostow, speaking
                            personally, the political implication of the crisis was clear. Germany
                            wished to assert its economic primacy.</p>
                        <p>We knew of course of French sensitivity to the thought that we treated
                            Britain differently from France. The issue had been raised again
                            recently in a discussion in Paris of our response to the German
                            proposals for a commercial arrangement between the E.E.C. and the
                            non-member countries of Europe. A French official had remarked that we
                            hadn't reacted that way to <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. Rostow thought, speaking for himself, that in the
                            right political setting, the issue of differential treatment of Britain
                            and France, which was largely illusory, could be overcome, even in the
                            nuclear field, without affecting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said he was returning to
                            Paris today, and would discuss Rostow's reflections with M.
                            Debre.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the monetary crisis, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> expressed great appreciation for American action
                            and statements.<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">A mounting German trade

                            He said it had been a good week for Franco-American relations. Rostow
                            said that <persName corresp="#p_DM1">M. Debré</persName>
                            could know that we had suggested last summer that the Germans consider
                                revaluation,<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">Germany rejected proposals
                                for a revaluation of its currency.</note> in order to safeguard the
                            system, and head off pressure on the pound and the franc. We attached
                            great importance to constructive action in response to paragraph 8 of
                            the Bonn communiqué.<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">For text of
                                the communiqué, November 22, see Department of State

                            effectively as we had that of last March, when we liberated the banking
                            system from the gold pool.</p>
                        <p>Rostow also suggested that this might be a good time for France to take a
                            new look at the <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> proposals. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said it was his impression that
                            the French position on this question was not fixed. Rostow said that
                            whatever happened, <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>'s
                            would be necessary because of the shortage of gold.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> mentioned French interest in
                            a new Bretton Woods monetary conference. Rostow said there was great
                            interest in many places in such an idea. But what would such a
                            conference accomplish? The Group of Ten could carry out the mandate of
                            paragraph 8 of the Bonn communiquéand the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> had already started an important study
                            of the management of the new system, in which gold, <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>'s and foreign exchange would
                            all be used as reserves. We attached very great importance to the
                            potentialities of that study. We were in favor of the continued reform
                            of the system, but saw no need at the moment for a conference. We remain
                            opposed to any consideration of changing the dollar price of gold.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said he saw no reason
                            for such a change.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> cannot speak for the Italian
                            Government, but he will be accompanied by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, who can. As chief of state
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> has limited substantive
                            responsibilities, but his influence on Italian policies is increased by
                            his leadership of the largest faction of the Christian Democratic party.
                            He obstructed the formation of Italy's new, center-left
                            government under Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Aldo
                                Moro</persName> because he does not believe the Socialists can yet
                            be trusted in domestic or foreign policy. He could try to influence you
                            to take a very careful attitude toward the new government. He is
                            pro-American and will use his visit to reaffirm Italy's
                            position in the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
                        <p>We want to use <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s
                            visit to reaffirm U.S.-Italian ties, which have been very close since
                            the war, and to emphasize our identity of views on most world problems.
                            By receiving Segni warmly, we hope to strengthen his friendship for us,
                            since he could be a point of stability should the present government
                            fail. At the same time, we do not want to encourage him in activity that
                            might undermine the government or give the impression that we view
                            current Italian politics entirely as he does.</p>
                        <p>In view of his constitutional position, the ceremonial aspects of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s visit
                            should be stressed. It will not be necessary or appropriate to consider
                            U.S.-Italian bilateral relations in depth. The major subjects to be

                        </p>
                        <p>Main subjects raised with Ambassador by President <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> smack of unease with which he
                            regards Italy's current international posture, heightened no
                            doubt by his distrust of center-left government. Would appear he wishes
                            to set forth in Washington especially those worries that he may feel are
                            not sufficiently shared by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>
                            and in case of Germany and Yugoslavia by US Government.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> is basically conservative. He
                            therefore is against and fears new center-left government headed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>. There is even some
                            speculation that he would like to see it fall as soon as possible and
                            would not be averse to helping bring this about if it were at all
                            possible. Therefore, when <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>
                            urges that <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> be pushed ahead despite
                            Socialist objections, it is possible that he does so not only out of
                            pure pro-Western <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0210"/>conviction and
                            ardor. We would therefore recommend repeating to him that the US is
                            prepared to go along as fast as our allies interested in the project
                            feel themselves able to go. We are not trying to rush things neither are
                            we trying to postpone them. We understand what may be British internal
                            problems as we do those of Italy.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">In his
                                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> stated
                                “he did not understand why Italian action on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> should be linked with British
                                elections.” (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>On point two, concerning Yugoslavia,<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">According
                                to telegram 1814 from Rome, <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> stated that the “military posture
                                of Yugoslavia hellip; is now directed against Italy hellip; . He
                                expressed fear about policies which might be followed hellip; by
                                Tito's successors,” and concern about border
                                problems.</note> two factors probably underlie <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s concern: (1) Fact
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> has accepted invitation
                            to visit Belgrade; (2) implications <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> and some of his top advisers may feel flow from US
                            intentions to carry out certain military reductions in Europe,
                            particularly in Italy. It is not unlikely, though we have no direct
                            evidence, that Andreotti has discussed with <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> US proposed reduction in US forces in <gloss target="#t_SETAF1">SETAF</gloss> through transfer to Italy of
                            certain support functions, and may wish try to head this off, lest such
                            withdrawals lead eventually to complete US withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SETAF1">SETAF</gloss> and even now begin give
                            encouragement to neutralist trends and sympathies in Italy.</p>
                        <p>Certainly <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s
                            concern about Yugoslavia is not consistent with views of Italian FonOff,
                            as reflected by Director Political Office II (Terruzzi) and included in
                            FonOff briefing of Saragat at end December (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1743).<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">Telegram 1743 from
                                Rome, December 30, 1963, reported that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> had accepted invitations to visit
                                Yugoslavia. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 IT)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is however consistent with perennial rumors of such Yugo build-ups.
                            They traditionally regard Yugoslavia as Italy's natural
                            enemy. Our Army Attaché however states that he has seen no
                            hard evidence of Yugoslav military build-up along Italian border. In
                            fact in last talk he had on subject with US Army Attaché
                            Belgrade (Sept. 63) he learned that latter also had no evidence that
                            such rumors were worthy of credence.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> raises Yugoslav problem
                            while in US, we would hope US officials would air it thoroughly with him
                            and with <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, particularly in
                            making clear basic aspects of US-Yugoslav policy which Italian military
                            and perhaps also <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> apparently
                            do not understand and even regard with some distrust.</p>
                        <p>As for <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s concern
                            about nationalist tendencies in Germany,<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">According to telegram 1814 from Rome, <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> that “he believed that German

                            not need our advice on how to handle what seems to us to be an
                            exaggerated expression of a fear which is widely held <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0211"/>in Italy. We would only suggest, as
                            regards aspect of particular relevance to Italy, consideration of the
                            possibility of turning point around by hinting to Segni that Italian
                            Government should consider jointly with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> serious effort to improve German public image in this
                            country through emphasis on its European-minded,
                            democratically-oriented, non-nationalistic aspects. Curiously enough, it
                            is usually Communists and other leftist political elements here who are
                            prone to dwell on alleged dangers of German militarism and nationalism,
                            rather than such right-wingish Christian Democrats as <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary told the Foreign Minister that we welcomed the opportunity
                            to hear observations and suggested that he select his own subject to
                            begin the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister preferred to comment first on the Italian political
                            situation. He thought Italy's greatest contribution to
                            Atlantic solidarity could be made by strengthening democratic
                            institutions in Italy and further isolating the Communist Party. His own
                            political activity <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0212"/>over the
                            past eighteen years had been aimed at isolating the Communists,
                            particularly at pulling the Socialists away from the Communist Party,
                            which implied abandoning some pro-Communists to the far left. He had
                            always received his greatest assistance from the Christian Democratic
                            party and specifically from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>, who ranks second only to De Gasperi as the most
                            significant political personality in postwar Italy. This policy is
                            beginning to bear fruit. The Socialists are agreeing, unenthusiastically
                            but increasingly, to move away from the Communists, and they are in the
                            government. In an important speech in Rome recently Nenni said that even
                            if his party had a majority in Italy, it would nevertheless regard the
                            Atlantic pact and Atlantic solidarity as “permanent
                            facts.” The internal situation has improved and the shadow of
                            a Communist-Socialist alliance has passed. The present government has
                            better than a sixty per cent majority compared to only fifty-one per
                            cent for its predecessors, which makes it far more stable. The Foreign
                            Minister said that the position of the Socialists has now become
                            irreversible and, after the administrative elections within a year or
                            even earlier, this will in his opinion lead to a new Social Democratic
                            party along the lines of the German party or the Labor Party in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, though not so strong.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> thought would become of the new faction of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>: there seem to be several
                            possibilities; one is that this faction will move toward the extreme
                            left. How much possibility is there that it will take a large part of
                            the Socialist following with it?<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Reference to
                                the “Carristi” faction of left-wing Socialists
                                which broke off from the Italian Socialist Party at the time of its
                                entry into the Moro government and formed the Italian Socialist
                                Party of Proletarian Unity (<gloss target="#t_PSIUP1">PSIUP</gloss>). The Embassy analyzed the impact of this development
                                in telegram 1882 from Rome, January 14. (Ibid., Central Files
                                1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 IT)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that, as shown by <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>'s statement, the trend toward democracy
                            is irreversible. Seven years ago the Socialist Party listened
                            attentively to Stalin; six years ago it listened to Khrushchev. Now it
                            listens to the British Labor Party and soon it may pay attention only to
                            what is good for Italy. At any rate it has clearly become westernized.
                            In this regard, contacts between the Socialists and American political
                            parties would be extremely useful. We have reaped the fruit of years.
                            This is not a haphazard happening; we knew what we were looking for.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked the Foreign Minister and asked when he expected the
                            Socialists and the Social Democratic parties to unite. The Minister said
                            that the first step after administrative elections would possibly be to
                            organize the two parties into a federation, to be followed <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0213"/>later by an organic merger. The new
                            dissident Socialist party would end as Daniel Mayer's
                            dissident group did in France; it had dwindled to nothing two years
                            after it left the French Socialist Party.</p>

                        <p>The two Presidents began their private discussion (with only Sensi and
                            the interpreters present) on the Italian political situation,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">In the course of this discussion, <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> expressed concern about
                                “problems arising from the Nenni Socialists,”
                                in particular their stand on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. In
                                response to a query from President Johnson, he underlined the
                                “renewed firmness” with which both the
                                Christian Democratic Party and Catholic Church were fighting
                                Communism. A memorandum of this conversation is ibid.</note> and
                            then passed on to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> said that there are
                            still problems within Socialist ranks on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, however,
                            are faithful to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> concept, and the
                            Socialists realize that this is a very important question for the United
                            States; they also will agree to its creation. But it will take a little
                            time, perhaps five or six months, particularly because much of the
                            uncertainty on the part of the Socialists stems from the indecision of
                            the British Labor Party. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>
                            said that of course Labor may say certain things now and then act
                            differently later on, but Italy wants to form a majority on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> issue before the British elections,
                            which will take place about November.</p>
                        <p>Later in the conversation, the President thanked <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> for his strong support for <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. He said he thought the Paris
                            discussions are <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0214"/>going well and
                            asked how <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> views them.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> replied that they had
                            proceeded satisfactorily. The issue would probably turn out as desired,
                            based on conviction on the one hand. On the other hand, when the Nenni
                            Socialists understand how strongly the United States feels about it,
                            their endorsement will be forthcoming. This, incidentally, would
                            ultimately signal their complete break with the Communists.</p>
                        <p>After a short discussion of the Atlantic community, the President asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> if he could be certain
                            of Italy's final position on <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Segni replied that at this moment he could not speak
                            with complete certainty, but he felt reasonably sure that, with patience
                            and fortitude, and Socialist realization of the importance of the issue
                            for the United States, Italy would be able to support it.</p>

                            Italy could take part in the talks going on about <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> without making any final commitments.
                            Italy has meanwhile agreed to take part in the mixed-manned
                            demonstration on a destroyer with the other five participants. It was
                            agreed during the talks that it was necessary to allow time for
                            discussions among certain elements within Italy and within the
                            government. Hence it appeared that the time required for internal
                            discussions in Italy and for the multilateral talks could coincide.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he hoped Foreign Minister Saragat will give his
                            personal attention to U.S.-Italian differences over air transport. We
                            understand there will be negotiations in March. The Secretary said he
                            hoped the Foreign Minister could keep the situation from deteriorating
                            between now and then. He was not asking for a decision now but wished to
                            avoid any worsening of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> said that
                            he had talked with the President of Alitalia about the air transport
                            problem and is surprised by what has happened. The President of Alitalia
                            is pro-American but is very much exercised over the matter. He asked
                            Ambassador Cattani to speak to this subject since he was not informed in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Cattani said he was sure that between now and March the
                            situation can be kept from deteriorating. If the Secretary were asking
                            Italy to grant now what is being asked by the American side, the Italian
                            position would be much more reserved. Italy wants the authorities here
                            to realize something must be done to balance the points of difference.
                            The Secretary said he understood there was a difference of view
                            regarding the interpretation of the existing agreements and hoped the
                            Foreign Minister would personally look into the problem and keep in
                            touch.</p>

                        <p>The general question of our future covert support activities in Italy has
                            come up again, this time in connection with the Civic Action project.
                                <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> has agreed to continue support
                            for Civic Action this fiscal year, but with the understanding that it
                            will not be asked to approve further extension of this support before we
                            have reviewed the entire program.</p>
                        <p>As the new government takes hold I hope you can give us the benefit of
                            your thoughts on the suitability of existing programs in the new
                            situation and what might be changed usefully.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">According to notes of the June 4 meeting of the 303 Committee:

                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> led off by stating that we had
                            been watching Italy's economic and financial problems with
                            great interest and took it that there had been a good turn in the past
                            few weeks. Governor Carli replied by presenting a detailed account of
                            the Italian economic situation along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Italy had reached a most difficult moment and the stabilization
                            actions of the last month had been a turn for the good. There had been
                            no appreciable variation in the price level last month, but the major
                            concern now was that there be no further large increases in wage costs
                            which would lead to increased prices. Credit restrictions had been
                            instituted last summer leading to some violent public criticism.</p>
                        <p>2. During the second half of 1962/first half of 1963, there had been an
                            increase in wages which far exceeded productivity increases. The effect
                            was a profit squeeze, which necessitated intervention to increase
                            liquidity in order to finance previously planned investments and new
                            projects which could no longer be financed through internal funding.
                            Increased liquidity contributed to the aggregate amount of credit and
                            helped bring about increased prices, which resulted in a partial
                            reconstitution of profits. The effect of wage increases over
                            productivity increases was a redistribution of income which caused an
                            increase in consumption, decrease in savings, and a concentration of
                            demand for meats and fats which had to be imported. Two-thirds of the
                            B/P deficit was accounted for by increased food imports.</p>
                        <p>3. Italy would have to solve the problems of completion of its public
                            investment program, reducing capital investment in factories, and
                            partial substitution of real savings with liquidity. Italy's
                            wage explosion had been caused by higher labor mobility in the Common
                            Market which resulted in movement of Italian wages to the levels of
                            other <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries. This occurred at a
                            time when the rapid postwar expansion in the capital market had been
                            checked and the market itself was not fully developed. Nationalization
                            of electricity also had had the effect of reducing the efficiency of the
                            market in 1963. The increase in the volume of bank credit had dropped in
                            the past two months from the level of last July. The profit squeeze is
                            continuing and opportunities for placement of issues on the market is
                            being reduced. Accordingly, <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0218"/>the
                            public has gotten the message of serious credit restrictions. Economic
                            planning has become necessary regardless of which political philosophy
                            one espouses. A list of priorities in public expenditures is needed.
                            This will also require firm action to limit expenditures by local
                            authorities who usually run large deficits.</p>
                        <p>4. The Government has two objectives: (a) To reduce the expansion of
                            credit. (b) To reduce the rate of growth of consumption. To achieve
                            this, the Government initiated the stabilization measures of February 22
                            which have shocked the country and are the subject of lively discussion.
                            Their purpose is to make more resources available for exports and
                            investment, are logical steps, and are making the public more aware of
                            the existence of the problem. The Government desires an expansion in
                            exports of about 10% per year. Italy has an integrated economy rather
                            than a self-contained one, and must act as an open economy integrating
                            itself into a wider market. It must increase its productivity and devote
                            more exports to manufactured products, thus necessitating increased
                            efficiency in manufacturing and completion of plants now under
                            construction. This cannot be done if the price level continues to move
                            upward. Accordingly, the Government must make the credit squeeze felt,
                            which will probably reduce the growth of industrial expansion, but this
                            is a price Italy must pay.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by the Under Secretary as to the success of the
                            fiscal measures, Governor Carli said there had been no increase in the
                            deficit of the federal budget, although he did not know whether there
                            had been a marked increase in the budgets of local governments. The
                            restrictions on credit and purchase taxes were designed to cut back
                            consumption of consumer durables, especially automobiles. Carli noted in
                            reply to another question by the Under Secretary that in the last two
                            months short-term movement of capital had been a two-way traffic rather
                            than the one-way traffic of last year. He observed that the credit
                            squeeze had obliged some people to bring funds back to Italy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schaetzel</persName> asked about pockets
                            of unemployment in Italy. Governor Carli replied some of these remained.
                            However, the migration from South to North had been slowing down. In
                            order to further encourage this, investments in the South must be
                            increased to promote its development.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked about the shift in Italian dietary habits to
                            greater consumption of proteins. Carli reiterated that two-thirds of the
                            1963 balance of payments deficit had resulted from imports of
                            foodstuffs. Italy's dietary habits had changed and there was
                            now a demand for more meats and fats. The Under Secretary then asked if
                            Italy could increase its consumer savings by a popular bond issue. Carli
                            replied that the price level must first be stabilized. The Under
                            Secretary referred to Carli's discussions with Treasury
                            officials seeking assistance <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0219"/>in
                            respect of Italy's reserve holdings. Carli acknowledged he
                            had been discussing possible financial devices to help in the months
                            ahead, while Italy proceeded with industrialization of the South and
                            modernization of its industry.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary commented that we were very sympathetic to developing
                            the kind of defense Italy will need. The lira is an important currency.
                            We have an interest and concern in the stability of the Italian economy
                            following its remarkable recovery in the postwar period. We assume that
                            the political uncertainty of last year had had a substantial effect. If
                            the new Government shows a solidity missing last year, this should be
                            very helpful. We are impressed by what we have seen in the way the
                            Government is moving ahead on the political side. He then asked whether
                            the fears of the financial community concerning the “opening
                            to the left” had abated. Governor Carli replied that he did
                            not feel the Government had fully explained the scope of the measures it
                            was taking, and thought a better job could be done in this regard,
                            especially in pointing out the curtailment of public expenditures.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by Mr. Johnson as to whether the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> tariff reductions had affected
                            Italy's competitive position, Mr. Ranalli stated that the
                            problem was not one of competition, but one in which Italian demand had
                            been larger than supply. As for automobile imports from the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries, only 1/5 of
                            Italy's 44% increase in automobile registrations last year
                            had resulted from foreign car imports.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary concluded the discussion by expressing his
                            appreciation for Governor Carli's lucid exposition of
                            Italy's problems, and stated that we wanted to be as helpful
                            as we could in solving them.</p>

                        <p>I am attaching a copy of an Italian Government announcement<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Not printed.</note> describing the agreements
                            reached between Under Secretary Roosa and Governor Carli of the Bank of
                            Italy. It will be given to the press in Rome Saturday afternoon for
                            release Sunday morning. There will be a simultaneous release here in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>The agreements on the part of the United States total $733 million of
                            assistance in one form or another. In addition, since yesterday the
                            Germans, at our urging, have agreed to a $150 million swap with Italy
                            and the British have agreed to a $100 million swap. The overall total
                            has been rounded up to “approximately $1 billion”
                            in the announcement.</p>
                        <p>As I explained yesterday,<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">According to the
                                President's Daily Diary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> met with President Johnson

                                has been found.</note> the United States assistance will include
                            activation of the remaining $150 million of the $250 million standby
                            swap arrangement between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of
                            Italy—a new $100 million swap between the
                            Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Bank of
                            Italy—a $200 million Export-Import Bank line of
                            credit—$250 million in standard three-year <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credits for the purchase of
                            agricultural commodities, and the purchase by the Treasury of $33
                            million in lire which is the balance required to offset our outstanding
                            medium-term borrowings from Italy. None of these transactions will have
                            any adverse effect on our balance of payments and the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">ExIm</gloss> credits should result in larger U.S. exports than
                            would otherwise have been the case.</p>
                        <p>As I told you yesterday, the information given us by Governor Carli of
                            the Bank of Italy leads us to believe that the Italian program to
                            redress their balance of payments will be effective and stands a good
                            chance of eliminating the Italian deficit over the next 18 to 24 months.
                            The funds available to Italy as a result of the current agreements are
                            considerably more than adequate to care for this year's
                            prospective deficit. The announcement of the large total is designed to
                            obviate any threat of speculative attack on the lira. The urgency and
                            timeliness of this action is evidenced by the fact that rumors of a
                            weekend devaluation of the lira swept the exchange markets today causing
                            one large New York bank to suspend all dealings in Italian exchange.
                            Italian foreign exchange losses today also exceeded $60 million.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> program has been cleared with
                            Under Secretary Murphy at Agriculture and the entire program, including
                            the text of the Italian statement, has been cleared by us with the

                                telegram 2384 from Rome, March 8, which outlined the economic

                            Italy, which presents an excellent review of the current situation. We
                            feel that the views expressed by the Italian officers are sincere and
                            that they believe them to be true; nevertheless, these views are in line
                            with their traditionally rightist and conservative views and reflect
                            reaction that is probably more subjective than objective.</p>
                        <p>1. General Giovanni De Lorenzo, Chief of the Italian Carabinieri Corps,
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>], expressed to source his concern over what he
                            regards as a progressively deteriorating <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0222"/>political-economic situation in Italy. He stated that
                            he had been fairly optimistic in January 1964, but that he no longer
                            felt that way. He observed that the interplay of political and economic
                            factors, combined with what he described as a completely supine
                            government, was leading the government toward a condition of increasing
                            discrimination, strikes, lockouts, and mass demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>2. Volunteering at the outset that it was not a matter of a coup
                            d'etat, <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName>
                            hastened to add that the time had come for responsible leaders of the
                            country to make responsible decisions. The <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> government, he said, could not go on as it had
                            been, because, if it did, the country would go Communist by default, and
                            he and people like him would become “the usual
                            refugees.” Now, he said, is the time to show firmness, while
                            the forces of public order—especially the
                            Carabinieri—are still able to command the situation. If there
                            were to be demonstrators in the piazza, let them come and be dealt with
                            firmly, even if such action should produce casualties.</p>
                        <p>3. The present <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> government,
                            according to de Lorenzo, must give way to a government headed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_LG2">Giovanni Leone</persName> (former
                            Premier) or Cesare Merzagora (President of the Senate), or Paolo Emilio
                            Taviani (Minister of the Interior), or to a “Government of
                            National Salvation,” or even to a revitalized <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> government with backbone and a
                            definite line of action. But it must be made clear to Moro and other
                            leaders that this is a time for decision.</p>
                        <p>4. To this end, <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> said,
                            he had an appointment on [less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified] to see Antonio Segni, President of Italy, with whom he
                            intended to talk in very similar terms. He also said that he had an
                            appointment on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] to talk to Merzagora for the same purpose. He
                            mentioned no one else by name.</p>
                        <p>5. When sounded out concerning the attitude of the military, de Lorenzo
                            replied that they had always avoided involvement in such matters; he
                            seemed to imply that, while the military might share his views, they
                            were not involving themselves. As regards the large industrialists, he
                            indicated their concern and frustrations, but he cited none by name or
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> went on to describe
                            himself as normally being a patient man, but said his own patience was
                            wearing thin. He had had numerous contacts recently in various quarters,
                            he indicated, and had found considerable support for his point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>7. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>8. As being of possible significance in relation to the above, the
                            following remarks which reflect concern on the part of several senior
                            members of the combined Armed Forces Intelligence Service (<gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>) are also noted:</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>A. On [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] said he was depressed by a discussion he had had
                            the previous day with Umberto Ortolani, President of the Istituto
                            Nazionale per le Case Degli Impiegati Dello Stato (INCIS; National
                            Institute for Houses of State Employees). Ortolani painted a dark
                            picture of the Italian economic situation, predicted that, if things
                            continued as they were, some 25,000 construction workers would be laid
                            off in the next couple of months and this would result in public
                            demonstrations. Ortolani described Giovanni Pieraccini (Minister of
                            Public Works) as an able and honest man, but said that his hands were
                            tied by those around him; therefore Pieraccini could do little about the
                            present economic crisis. The <gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>
                            officer stated that he had found confirmation of Ortolani's
                            views in other financial and commercial sectors. For example, the
                            Olivetti firm was trying to get Giuseppe Pella (former Minister of the
                            Budget) to take over as president, in an effort to inspire more
                            confidence in investors. This <gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>
                            officer felt that the present government would fall before long, perhaps
                            within the next couple of months, and that it would be just as well for
                            it to fall now as later.</p>
                        <p>B. On [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>], source met briefly Colonel Renzo Rocca, Chief of
                                <gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>'s Economic and
                            Industrial Intelligence Office, who had just emerged from a discussion
                            of the current situation with General Egidio Viggiani, Chief of <gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>. Rocca, who in the past has
                            regularly blamed the flight of Italian capital on the lack of confidence
                            in the center-left government, said that the situation is definitely not
                            good, and it is not getting any better, and that certain changes
                            (unspecified) are essential. [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source
                                text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>C. Viggiani expressed himself as being in general agreement with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName>, but not quite to
                            the gloomy extent of the latter. He said that the situation is actually
                            not bad at present, but that the potential danger is great. He felt
                            that, in order to head off the threat of a serious deterioration,
                            forceful economic and financial measures are called for; otherwise, the
                            country would reach the point of collapse—which could benefit
                            only the Communists who would be ready to exploit the resultant chaos to
                            install a Communist system. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> that a new government was called for, and
                            thought that such a government should include technicians like Donato
                            Menichella (Administrative Councilor of the Association for the
                            Development of Industry in the South) for finance, some important
                            industrialist for commerce, and so on. While such a government should
                            include political figures, they should be only those of demonstrated
                            competence. As for an adequate chief of government, he acknowledged that
                            this was the biggest problem of all. He found Moro timorous and
                            vacillating and charged him with playing into Communist hands in his
                            dealings with Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) leaders on
                            labor matters. <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0224"/>He observed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> had given recently a
                            pitiful performance on television and considered him much too weak for
                            the job. He said that names mentioned for leadership of the government
                            include: Taviani, <persName corresp="#p_LG2">Leone</persName>, and
                            Merzagora, but felt that none of them would be a good choice. Randolfo
                            Pacciardi, who has recently broken away from the Italian Republican
                            Party, had no following; Emilio Colombo (Minister of the Treasury) was
                            too young. For him, the most capable man was <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Amintore Fanfani</persName> (former Premier) whom he regards as
                            definitely and strongly anti-Communist, notwithstanding the
                            opportunistic traits he has shown in the past. But, regardless of who
                            might head it, a new government is needed in the near future to take
                            vigorous steps to restore confidence in the economy, adopting austerity
                            measures where necessary, reducing the outflow of capital, and perhaps
                            obtaining foreign loans. There must be no further sliding by the
                            government toward positions of increased strength for the Communists;
                            and, if the latter attempt to force the issue through demonstrations,
                            they should be stopped now, even at the cost of a few casualties.
                            Viggiani felt that the temper of the people is such that, instead of
                            creating martyrs and leading to an even more tense situation, this
                            (i.e., stopping of demonstrations at a cost of a few casualties) would
                            have a settling effect on the public at large. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> that the forces of order
                            are now able to control the situation but that, with further slippage,
                            they might no longer be able to do so.</p>

                            officer had May 19 with Lt. Gen. Giovanni De Lorenzo, Commander of the
                            Arm of the Carabinieri, at the residence of the Embassy Air
                            Attaché. The General commented frankly but, of course, off
                            the record, <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0225"/>on such issues as
                            the strength of Pacciardi's movement for a
                            “second” Republic, the political thinking of the
                            top Italian security and military officers, and the Communist menace in
                            Italy. During part of the conversation Brig. Gen. Luigi Violante, until
                            recently Italian Air Attaché in Washington, was also present.
                            The two men differed markedly in their ideas on the Italian political
                            situation. While <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> was
                            tolerant and even sympathetic towards <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s center-left government, Violante was
                            violently opposed to it and predicted that the government would resign
                            by the end of summer.</p>

                        <p>Randolfo Pacciardi's Democratic Union for the Second Republic
                            (cf. A-1581 of May 14)<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">Not printed.
                                (Ibid.)</note> was not taken seriously by Italy's
                            security and military leaders. Pacciardi had some good ideas and was
                            honest and in earnest, but his approach was totally wrong. His weakest
                            point was to attempt to attract all kinds of people and to draw
                            everybody in his movement who had a grudge against the present Italian
                            Republic, from the extreme left to the extreme right. This motley group
                            of people had no political or ideological cohesion; their only common
                            denominator was dissatisfaction with the status quo. Particularly weak

                            Pacciardi's banner. Pacciardi's movement will end
                            like Giannini's Qualunquismo of the late

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Armed Forces Could Support Well-Organized
                            Rightist Party</p>
                        <p>The top security and military officers would very much prefer to see
                            organized a strong rightist political party which they can support and
                            from which they can obtain political and ideological orientation. But
                            such a party must be democratic and ready to respect the Republican
                            Constitution. Unfortunately, however, the Italian right is in disarray
                            and, aside from the Liberal Party (<gloss target="#t_PLI1">PLI</gloss>),
                            poorly led and generally discredited. The Monarchists are all but
                            finished because they lack political vision and realism. The
                            Neo-Fascists (MSI) leaders are hopelessly divided, squander their time
                            in gambling houses, and still pretend to live in an age (the Fascist
                            Era) which the great majority of the Italians abhor. There is no future
                            for them in Italy; both should dissolve themselves as soon as possible.
                            The Liberals are a respectable and democratic group, but they are too
                            preoccupied with the preservation of their vested interests. They have
                            made no serious attempt to establish contact <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0226"/>with the military. What the country's
                            security and military leaders wished was the emergence of a new party,
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PLI1">PLI</gloss> as the nucleus, which would
                            embrace all the right-wing forces, including moderate-elements that now
                            belong to the MSI and the Monarchist Party, who believe in the
                            preservation of the Italian Republic. Such a party would have the full
                            support of the security and military establishments either indirectly in
                            elections or directly, if need be, should the security of the state be
                            threatened through Communist subversion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reliability of Security Establishments</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> gave a detailed
                            account of what he called the “order of
                            reliability” of Italy's security and military
                            establishment. As expected, he placed the Carabinieri Forces at the top
                            of the list as the mainstay of the state institutions. These forces of
                            some 80,000 strong (the figure is the General's) were most
                            reliable because of their long tradition and their recruitment
                            procedures. A thorough investigation was conducted on each member of the
                            force, and particular care was taken in checking the records of
                            prospective brides of all Carabinieri troops and officers. Second in
                            reliability come the Public Security (Pubblica Sicurezza, some 75,000
                            strong) forces, whose ranks are also carefully checked before they are
                            recruited. In the three armed services (Army, Navy, and Air Force), the
                            cadres (officers and professional non-commissioned officers) are
                            reliable, but the situation among the “troops”
                            (ranks) is not so good; too many of them seem to have voted for the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> in the 1963 national elections.
                            Generally reliable are the Alpine and the Bersaglieri units.</p>
                        <p>The morale of the Carabinieri is very high despite constant snipings by
                            the Communist and Socialist press. It is the policy of the Carabinieri
                            high command to promote or otherwise confer deserved rewards on any
                            officer or man who gets into difficulties during labor disturbances.
                            Also, it is the policy of the high command to exaggerate the number of
                            Carabinieri casualties as a consequence of such disturbances in order to
                            discredit the labor unions (principally the Communist-controlled CGIL).
                            For instance, <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName>
                            revealed, his command claimed that there were nearly 150 Carabinieri
                            casualties during the labor riots last October at Holy
                            Apostles' Square in Rome, whereas actually only four or five
                            Carabinieri were hurt (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1008 of

                        <p>There is general agreement at the top levels of the security and military
                            establishments that the most efficient way to eliminate the internal
                            Communist menace would be for the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> to
                            take the fatal step of staging an open revolt. The revolt would be so
                            ruthlessly suppressed that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> would
                            be eliminated for good. Unfortunately, however, Togliatti and his
                            associates are fully aware of the consequences of an open rebellion, and
                            they are accordingly banking on assuming power through parliamentary
                            procedures. <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> did not
                            think they had a chance to assume power this way, but General Violante
                            violently disagreed, fearing that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> would continue to gain among the electorate and that
                            following a few more national elections, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> and the Socialists (both Nenni's and
                            Vecchietti's) might manage to obtain an absolute majority. In

                            view, however, the Nenni Socialists (including Riccardo Lombardi and his
                            associates) had crossed the Rubicon and had burned all bridges behind so
                            far as collaboration with the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> was
                            concerned. The <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> could therefore be

                        <p>Although Gen. <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> gave the
                            impression that he was expressing the general views of the security and
                            military establishments, the reporting officer had the feeling that the
                            General was revealing mostly his own position. It would be presumptuous
                            to gauge the political climate of the security and armed forces
                            leadership on the current situation in Italy by two or three samplings.
                            The reporting officer has, however, had previous conversations with

                            the prospects of the current Italian Cabinet were made available to the
                            U.S. Government. On at least one of these occasions, these views were
                            conveyed to President Johnson's Special Assistant for

                        <p>4. Past wage increases and end of mass labor reserve in south require

                            internationally competitive. Vast flow to northern cities in past

                            great deficit in docks, roads, and other infra-structure. Italy needs a

                            wing to take. As men, they feel themselves beleaguered in the stockade,
                            with two groups of Indians circling about and shooting flaming arrows.
                            They are not disheartened. They would like time to work all this out.
                            They like and trust each other as men. They realize they represent a
                            parliamentary majority and a popular majority if they can hold together.
                            But they also realize the government could fall at any time.</p>
                        <p>6. Outside the government there are strong right wing elements who wish
                            to bring the government down and business groups who are sitting on
                            their hands hoping for devaluation of the lire. There are also the
                            Communists who are distracted by both international schisms and some
                            puzzlement as to how to play domestic wage policy, but basically the
                            Communist unions are pressing for inflationary wage increases and making
                            life difficult even though the odds are for a right wing rather than
                            left wing succession, should <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>
                            fail.</p>
                        <p>7. Now for the rescuing cavalry. Marjolin came to town and made a good
                            impression with his manner and his advice. He apparently urged strong,
                            quick deflationary medicine. As a fellow-socialist his advice had more
                            impact than that of some other European commentators on the scene. Not
                            knowing what he said, in fact, I can only comment on the state of
                            Italian thought post-Marjolin.</p>
                        <p>8. There is a potentially dangerous confusion between two proportions
                            [positions]. One, Italy needs deflation. Politically and socially Italy
                            can stand very little deflation, and a deflationary process is already
                            underway. Two, Italy needs the acceptance of wage guidelines <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0230"/>which would relate future wage
                            movements to productivity changes and guarantee that expansion in public
                            and private investment would not lead to price increases. This is the
                            crux of the matter.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> and Carli are apparently
                            hoping that if they get through the current wage negotiations and the
                                <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> Congress in tolerable style they
                            will be able to relax the restrictions on private credit. I doubt that
                            this modest prospect, combined as it will be with new austerity taxes,
                            will prove sufficient for <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> to
                            hold his cohorts in line. What <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> needs, I am convinced after a long talk with
                            Lombardi and others, is an add-on in the form of a public investment
                            program. But Italy does not command the resources for this add-on unless
                            there is an absolute wage freeze for a substantial period. And this is
                            tough.</p>
                        <p>10. The critical economic and political question as I see it, therefore,
                            is whether Europe via Marjolin can generate a large capital infusion
                            into Italy, if <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> can, in effect, get wage
                            guidelines installed. As is typical in these stabilization-development
                            problems, what the politicians may be able to do depends partially on
                            their knowing what help is available from the outside if they do it.</p>
                        <p>11. If this analysis is shared in Washington, Rome, and Brussels what is
                            required, therefore, is a continuation of the Marjolin-Rome dialogue to
                            see if this parlay can be pulled off.</p>
                        <p>12. My conviction about all this was strengthened at lunch yesterday by
                            somewhat higher and more knowledgeable authority. Carlo Schmidt told me
                            that the Pope, whom he had seen, fears a dangerous right wing reaction
                            in Italy if unemployment rises and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> fails, urging on Germans and Europeans a program of
                            assistance to Italy.</p>

                            senior Italian [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            given limited distribution at high levels of the Italian Government [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] <hi rend="italic">Appraisal—2</hi>, that the views of the

                                declassified</hi>] are accurately reported, and that these views
                            reflect opinions probably generally prevailing in the Italian [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2 lines of source text) not

                        <p>1. The present economic and political situation is serious and whatever
                            left-center formula is adopted, it will inevitably fail. The only
                            solution will be an eventual overthrow of the present coalition
                            government. There will be various attempts to form compromise
                            governments (for example, <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Amintore
                                Fanfani</persName> might be asked to form a new government), but
                            these will be only temporizing measures and in fact will lead to further
                            deterioration of the political situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Lamentably, the present political dilemma has been caused by the
                            unwillingness in the past of the Christian Democratic Party (<gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>) to take effective action against the
                            leftist forces and to resolve the social-economic problems which
                            confronted Italy. An error commonly made by anti-Communist forces is to
                            seek perfect solutions to counter the Communists in resolving
                            political/economic problems. Greater progress will be achieved by
                            countering or neutralizing the Italian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>) on the specific issues which they
                            project. Admittedly, however, it is now rather late in the game to adopt
                            such measures; for this reason, the only lasting solution will come when
                            the center forces decide to take bold action by reversing the present
                            trend and returning to a center-liberal democratic government. Such
                            eventuality would probably bring the battle to the piazza (into the
                            streets) and result in some bloodshed. In the final analysis, however,
                            such action may <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0232"/>represent the
                            only realistic means of extricating the Italians from the present
                            creeping paralysis.</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] contended that the Italian populace is ripe for
                            such a turn of events; the people are disenchanted and have little
                            confidence in any of the present political leaders. What the people are
                            looking for is the “white hope” who will lead them
                            out of their present dilemma. In responding to a query as to who might
                            qualify as such a leader, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] said that one would have to be created;
                            as long as he represented a public image and was not compromised, the
                            public would rally around him.</p>
                        <p>4. As for the role that would fall to the security forces which would
                            have to maintain public order, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] indicated that General Giovanni
                            De Lorenzo, Commandant of the Carabinieri Corps, represented the only
                            force around whom the Italian security forces could rally. It was for
                            this reason that General de Lorenzo had organized mobile task force
                            battalions which could go into action in the event of a political
                            emergency. The Italian officer said that General <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> did not intend to exceed
                            his authority, but that he intended to control the military force which
                            would neutralize any attempt at leftist pressure on the piazza, and that
                            he would act as “king maker” in the event of a
                            political overthrow. In this connection, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] noted that <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> has developed a direct
                            relationship with President Antonio Segni and had won the
                            latter's confidence. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] also commented that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> represents the only
                            viable political figure in terms of public backing and constitutional
                            authority, and that in a political emergency the current political
                            personalities would fade rapidly.</p>
                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] iterated his view that the political situation
                            would eventually be resolved in the piazza. He described the Italian
                            public as bewitched by the leftist influences in Italy, and particularly
                            by the Italian Socialist Party (<gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>)
                            which he branded as worse than the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            because it projected the party as being
                            “social-democratic” and was in a position to
                            mislead non-Communist elements. Recognizing that individually there are
                            well-intentioned <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> types, he said they
                            had no important influence on major political or party issues. He termed
                            Riccardo Lombardi as an effective leader of <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> forces and said it was quite clear where
                            Lombardi's sympathies lay. The Italian officer felt it was
                            time to break the spell on the Italian public—something which
                            could be done only by eliminating all the forces and political
                            personalities who have brought Italy to its present critical situation.
                            This, he said, in turn could come about only by creating a fresh public
                            image even at the risk of deciding the issue on the piazza—a
                                <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0233"/>public image which could
                            return Italy to truly democratic ways and restore vitality and
                            confidence in the country's faltering, financial/commercial
                            structure.</p>
                        <p>6. Later on the same day [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] the above views were discussed with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            who said that he concurred in them. In this connection this senior
                            officer referred to an article in the 28 May 1964 issue of Il Borghese
                            (a rightist periodical) written by Giani Preda entitled,
                            “L'Ora Del 'Matto'
                            “ which promotes the idea that somewhere in Italy there is
                            someone now unknown who will come to the fore and lead Italy out of its
                            present dilemma. This senior officer suggested that for lack of other
                            candidates for this part, it might still fall upon General de Lorenzo to
                            fill this role, albeit temporarily, in a political crisis. This officer
                            added that de <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">Lorenzo</persName> probably
                            did not harbor such ambitions, but was willing to play the role of

                            considerations. In addition, this officer also spoke highly of Treasury
                            Minister Emilio Colombo saying that Colombo had the courage to challenge
                            social pressures for concessions which could lead only to a further
                            deterioration of the economic and political situation.</p>

                            political situation may be resolved without going to the piazza, but
                            doubted that it could be resolved by reforming it along center-left
                            lines or by calling for new elections. Eventually, he said, a center
                            type government would have to be instituted and leftist reaction on the
                            piazza would have to be met with a show of force—something

                            had a grudge against the present Italian Republic, from the extreme left
                            to the extreme right. This motley group of people had no political or
                            ideological cohesion; their only common denominator was dissatisfaction
                            with the status quo. Particularly weak and uninfluential were old

                        <p>The Italian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>)
                            continues to create interest and some confusion with its claims to be
                            democratic, and to be prepared to step down, once in power, if its
                            popular mandate were lost. Most recently, this line has been taken up in
                            a major pronouncement by <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0236"/>leftwing Pietro Ingrao. Careful
                            study of Ingrao's statements, however, leads to the
                            conclusion that there has been no meaningful change in the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>'s revolutionary,
                            totalitarian ideology. But Ingrao does appear to be emerging as one of
                            the hardest running potential successors of Togliatti, with the ability
                            to appeal not only to a very broad range of views within the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, but also to left-wing non-Communists
                            who favor working class unity. The Embassy concludes that Ingrao has
                            talent in appearing to be “all things to all
                            people” and that as such he is a potent weapon in the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> arsenal. While most Italians do not
                            accept Ingrao's or other Communist claims to be democratic
                            and trustworthy, a few leaders of public opinion welcome the Communist
                            line and interpret it to be significant, at least in part. To this
                            extent the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> line has enjoyed some
                            success and is able to make difficult the progress of the non-Communist
                            Italian left toward modern concepts of political democracy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>Much interest has been shown recently in Italy, particularly by left-wing
                            intellectuals and by the left and center-left political parties, in what
                            is frequently taken to be a slow and laborious effort by the Italian
                            Communist Party to seek a more democratic and
                            “Italian” course of development for the Party. A
                            careful reading of the many <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            statements on the subject of intra-Party and parliamentary democracy
                            leads inevitably to the conclusion that the symptoms of change within
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> relate to the continuing debate
                            as to the merits of the alternative “hard” and
                            “soft” lines of action open to the Party; the
                            international dispute within the Communist world movement; the question
                            of leadership and succession within the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>; and even the question of taking different leadership
                            views to the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> cadres, i.e., the
                            question of factionalism, by any other name. Unsurprisingly, Italian
                            Communist statements do not reveal any tendency whatsoever toward
                            democracy in any meaningful sense of the term, despite the fact that
                            some success has been achieved by the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> in its long term effort to present itself as a
                            responsible, respectable and democratic party in Italy.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has carefully reviewed the major developments in the
                            ideological debate currently in progress among the various elements of
                            the political left in Italy, and endeavors in this dispatch to focus
                            upon those significant documents and pronouncements necessary to assess
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> position, and upon the general
                            effect and importance of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> efforts
                            in this field. Part II of this report examines the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> claim to be a democratic organization.
                            Part III offers an interpretation of the relationship between the
                            current propaganda line and Party needs. Part IV discusses aspects of
                            the impact of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> line on the
                            Italian political scene, and the Embassy's conclusions are

                        <p>As has been reported in detail elsewhere, much frustration has built up
                            within the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> as a result of the
                            failure to prevent the formation of the present center-left government,
                            the steady decline in Party membership over the last decade, and the
                            reflected dissensions of the current dispute within the international
                            Communist movement. (See A-1032 of February 14, and A-1385 of April 7,
                                1964.)<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Neither printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12-3 IT)</note> These frustrations,
                            and the continued existence of the center-left threat, increase the
                            impatience of those Communists who favor a harder, more aggressive line.
                            These “hard-liners” believe that if the Party is
                            held on its current line it will ultimately incur the electoral losses
                            augured by the unmistakable signs of impotence revealed in the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> struggle to prevent the development of
                                <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> autonomy and the center-left.
                            The “hard-liners” oppose any tendency toward
                            “right-reformism,” and are generally categorized
                            as being on the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> left, although
                            sympathy for left-wing (Chinese) views in the international movement is
                            not necessarily implied by left-wing intra-Party positions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> rightwing
                            recognizes the danger that an overly aggressive <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> program could alarm the protest voters who have
                            supported the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> in increasing numbers
                            over the years, and could push the country as well as the government to
                            the right. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> rightwing points out
                            that the fate of the Greek Communist Party was avoided by the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> due to the wise (and very cautious)
                            middle-of-the-road leadership of Togliatti, and is convinced that
                            further gains can be made by the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> on
                            the present course.</p>
                        <p>The natural result of the middle-of-the-road approach of Togliatti,
                            however, has been the falling away of cadres on both the left and the
                            right of the Party, and a disastrous 65% decline in the membership of
                            the Italian Federation of Communist Youth (FGCI). It is generally
                            accepted that the FGCI could regain some of its lost ground with a more
                            militant, bluntly revolutionary line which would have a definite appeal
                            among young radically militant left-wing intellectuals, or alternatively
                            that gains could be made with an honestly democratic program which would
                            have to be based on the junking of the authoritarian Leninist concept of
                            democratic centralism. There is little the FGCI can do as long as it is
                            denied either course, except to blame the Party (as Achille Occhetta did
                            at the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> Conference on Organization in
                            March) <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0238"/>and hope that the FGCI
                            is not a bellwether for the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>. In
                            recent weeks there has been some evidence of a more aggressive and
                            intransigent <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> stance, particularly in
                            trade union activity, but as long as Togliatti remains firmly committed
                            to what amounts to a popular front line, and at the same time to the
                            principle of democratic-centralism, changes in <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> tactics and changes in <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> propaganda lines must be limited accordingly. In fact,
                            on the eve of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> Conference on
                            Organization in March, the Party seemed to be on dead center, in a
                            situation which clearly called for vigorous leadership to give the Party
                            spirit, conviction and direction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Ingrao's Solution</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the Party Conference (see A-1385 of April 7), signs of discontent and
                            impatience were much in evidence. Several speakers vigorously criticized
                            Party shortcomings and leadership methods, calling for more aggressive
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> opposition to the center-left
                            government, and for more freedom of discussion within the Party. The
                            most important of these speakers was Ingrao, the acknowledged leader of
                            the leftwing <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> hardliners. Although
                            Togliatti rejected the demands for change, the impatient comrades (all
                            on the left of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> spectrum)
                            established an image as innovators, struggling to modernize the standpat
                            Togliatti line. Since the Conference, much has been heard from Ingrao,
                            whose activities seem directed toward creating an image of a vigorous
                            young reformer, who offers the Party more action and more internal
                            democracy, and who sincerely assures the other Italian parties that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is a democratic and reliable
                            potential working partner.</p>
                        <p>Ingrao is one of the likely successors to Togliatti, and he is a
                            hard-running candidate. He is relatively young (49), he is a reformer,
                            and he does offer the Party more action. Beyond this, the image he and
                            the Party seek for him is credible only to the careless. As is set forth
                            above, even Ingrao's own words, if accepted without question,
                            do not make him out to be a democrat in any meaningful sense. Sources
                            acquainted with Ingrao have also indicated doubt to the Embassy, based
                            on estimates of his personality, that Ingrao would espouse the concept
                            of greater freedom of discussion within the Party once his own views and
                            his own leadership were established.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of internal Party democracy, Ingrao avoids talking about
                            democratic centralism by name, but is bluntly opposed to intra-Party
                            factions, thus agreeing with other Party spokesmen who maintain that
                            “factionalism” would be the inevitable and
                            undesirable result of abandoning democratic-centralism. Moreover, his
                            Conference position in favor of the need for “a way in which
                            the [Party]<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">All brackets are in the source
                                text.</note> militants can <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0239"/>make decisions, and not just participate in a debate,” (as
                            quoted in <hi rend="italic">Il Giorno</hi>, March 14, 1964) has turned
                            out to be as circumscribed as his support for political rights in the
                            socialist state. In his April 25 Rinascita article he commented:
                            “I find that often discussion is not efficacious and the
                            political organization doesn't really decide because [the
                            discussion] is based on reports that present again, without change, the
                            entire situation, the entire judgment, the entire political position of
                            the party (underscoring by Ingrao),<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">Printed
                                here in italics.</note> when instead it would be more appropriate to
                            highlight and put in discussion those developments, innovations, and
                            corrections that really add or take away or modify some part of the
                            analysis, line, or tactic of the party, rendering more evident and
                            explicit the modifications and the developments and in this way asking
                            the political organization to really decide hellip;” In other
                            words, discussion within the Party should be ample, but it should be
                            focused on the improvement of the Party analysis, line, or tactic, and
                            not sufficiently wide ranging to question basic Party positions.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, through Ingrao the Party appears to be taking a stand which
                            is intended to be all things to all people. To the impatient left the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> offers a young, vigorous and
                            hard-boiled left-wing leader. To non-Communist intellectuals and
                            left-wing political leaders, Ingrao offers a <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> position that includes “full
                            recognition” of “the essence of
                            democracy.” To the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> right
                            and Togliatti possibilismo elements, Ingrao offers capable leadership in
                            the Party drive for a popular front which, without Ingrao, would have
                            less and less appeal to the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> left.
                            There is no room for non-Communist illusions, either with regard to the
                            things Ingrao really stands for, or with regard to the real political
                            potential of the formula he is developing for a <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> panacea.</p>

                        <p>A large percentage of politically conscious Italians probably reject,
                            unread, the long and involved <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> tracts
                            in the Party theoretical journals, and perhaps seldom read any
                            representative cross section of the newspaper and periodical comment on
                            discussions as esoteric as the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> view
                            of the relationship between democracy and socialism. To many, the voice
                            of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is known to be unreliable
                            anyway, and there seems little point in laboring through the dialectic
                            to come once again to that conclusion. To others, particularly left-wing
                            non-Communist politicians and professional political analysts, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> line on democracy and socialism
                            is interesting, even encouraging and welcome as a debate with the
                            comrades, but hardly convincing. Many of these important <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0240"/>molders of Italian political opinion
                            are sound and unequivocal in their assessments. On the question of
                            political liberties, Avanti (January 16, 1964) noted that the Communists
                            have long been prepared to grant, once in power, all the political
                            liberties except the possibility to remove them from power. Concerning
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> claim to believe in a multiparty
                            system, the moderate left-wing Critica Sociale (February 5, 1964) cited
                            Khrushchev's recent discussions with Guy Mollet, in which
                            Khrushchev asserted the other parties could co-exist in a socialist
                            state where the Communists are in power. Khrushchev's
                            illustrations—Agrarian Istvan Kobi, Socialdemocrats
                            Cyrankiewicz, Grotewohl, Fierlinger, Szakistas, etc.—were
                            judged by Critica Sociale to be illustrative of Khrushchev's
                            well known sense of humor, and of the inanity of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> claim. On the subject of a minority
                            becoming the majority, in a Communist state, Vita (February 5, 1964)
                            also cited Khrushchev speaking to Mollet, when the question of an
                            opposition was brushed aside by Khrushchev, saying “We will
                            not go backwards"—language remarkably similar to that of
                            Togliatti on the same subject.</p>
                        <p>By and large, non-Communist politically conscious elements in Italy are
                            not confused by the Communist claim to democracy, whether they reject it
                            out of hand, as do the Italian conservatives and extreme right, or
                            whether they welcome the debate and give the devil his due, as is the
                            case among the non-Communist left.</p>

                            claims to democracy and their efforts toward working class unity in a
                            popular front are appealing to some political and intellectual leaders
                            whose opinions in Italy carry weight. These include intellectuals of the
                            stripe of Ernesto Rossi whose experiences seem to teach them that
                            fascism is the real and enduring threat to liberty, and who hopefully
                            see among the Communists democratic tendencies quite unapparent to other
                            observers (see A-1435 of April 17, 1964).<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">Not printed. (National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 IT)</note> They include Marxists
                            who are not alarmed by the dialectic of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> and the sophistry of Ingrao; who may be inclined, after
                            all, to recognize “the profound difference in
                            quality” between progressive and conservative forces. And
                            they include <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> personalities who
                            cherish the understandable conceit that the principal difference between
                            the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is that the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> is
                            several years ahead of the Communists in coming to terms with modern

                            must follow along and therefore is following along on the path of

                        <p>These troublesome traces of political or ideological confusion are always
                            at hand for the Communists to attempt to form into unwittingly <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0241"/>helpful political opinion, and

                            dupes such as Christian Democrat Giorgio La Pira need no comment. The

                            Lombardi, however, is more curious and more tragic. Opinions vary, with

                            to the left of the present government, or whether Lombardi's

                            Lombardi's desire to control the Socialist Party, and his
                            reluctance or inability to adjust his attitudes to the Socialist shift
                            from opposition to governmental responsibility, are other facets of his
                            complicated personality. vis-á-visthe Communists, Lombardi is
                            always willing to continue the dialogue, to hold out by implication the
                            possibility of eventual cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> at some further stage in the Communist evolution as he
                            sees it, and to ignore in large part his Party's judgement
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is an undemocratic element
                            to be isolated on the left. Rome's A-1628 of May 22,
                                1964<note n="6" xml:id="d101fn6">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 IT)</note> sets forth the
                            Lombardi view of the prospects for the unification of the whole working
                            class in Italy, to be accomplished by working persistently and patiently
                            for the type of evolution in the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            that has already occurred in Lombardi's own party. Lombardi
                            sees this taking place through a series of splits in the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> and the gradual isolation of the old
                            guard, beginning with Togliatti. In the place of his party's
                            view, that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> should be isolated
                            and its electorate captured by the democratic left, Lombardi apparently
                            holds the view that <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            “dogmatists” should be isolated, but that truly
                            “progressive” <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            elements could be absorbed by the democratic parties. Thus Lombardi
                            envisions a Marxist party absorbing and digesting a Marxist-Leninist
                            party; the sheep to devour the wolves. Lenin's comment
                            “Who-Whom"? has not helped Lombardi. On the contrary,
                            Lombardi's own contribution to Socialist confusion helps
                            explain why the splits usually occur in the Socialist Party, rather than
                            in the Marxist-Leninist <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>. Meanwhile,
                            Lombardi and the “maximalist” group he brought
                            with him to Avanti propagate the strange concept of the existence within
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> of good
                            “innovators” such as Pietro Ingrao, and bad
                            “Stalinists” such as Togliatti—an
                            assessment which sheds no light at all on the situation as it really
                            exists today. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking demonstrates the
                            state of ideological confusion that has predominated in the official
                            Socialist organ, Avanti, since Lombardi assumed control of the paper
                            last February.</p>

                        <p rend="center">V. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The situation within the Italian Communist Party is one of stress and is
                            indicative of change. The indications are, however, that the changes
                            underway reflect largely the imperative need of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> to adapt itself to the basically
                            perilous situation in which it finds itself in Italy today, in
                            confrontation with the center-left government. While pressures toward
                            democratic reform without doubt exist at the base of the Party, the
                            Party leaders publicly claim, and there is every reason to believe, that
                            the Party is and will remain Leninist, internally authoritarian, and
                            orthodox in its revolutionary intentions vis-á-visthe Italian
                            state. Left-wing non-Communists thus hope in vain that the pressures
                            from 1.7 million Italian Communists, who do not in any case understand
                            Marxism-Leninism, can induce basic ideological changes among a
                            leadership which is well trained, capable, and determined in its
                            adherence to revolutionary and totalitarian doctrine. The Embassy also
                            regards with reserve the view that the efforts of Ingrao and the
                            “innovators” are the beginning of the end for
                            democratic-centralism and authoritarian control within the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>. On the contrary, Ingrao may have given
                            the Party the solution to the knotty problem of how Party unity can be
                            forged, after Togliatti goes, from the disparate elements in the right
                            and the left wings of the Party.</p>
                        <p>The political blend of a left-wing reputation, a welcome call for grass
                            roots participation in <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> decisions,
                            and vigorous support of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> popular
                            front tactic, make Ingrao a considerable threat to Italian democracy,
                            and the threat is as yet unrecognized by some important democratic
                            left-wing leaders. The majority of Italians, including the Italian
                            leftwing, recognize that the Communist threat is unchanged.
                            Nevertheless, a small but influential element on the left will continue
                            hopefully to seek indications of <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            evolution toward democracy, and the wish will continue to be father to
                            the thought. The new, different, democratic Italian Communism is a myth,
                            but it will continue to impede the slow course of non-Communist
                            left-wing Italian political thought toward democracy and away from the
                            narrow class concepts which urge unity of the working class, i.e., unity
                            with the Communists, and which therefore furnish grist to the Communist
                            popular front mill.</p>

                            would mean indefinite deferral Italian decision to participate while

                            group. He raised both points with us and was given standard response. We

                        <p>The spate of press comment following a gloom-and-doom article on the
                            Italian political situation, published in Hamburg's Die Welt
                            on June 23, together with the clamorous activity of the Italian extreme
                            right and extreme left during the recent governmental crisis, were
                            followed by rumors in early July that a coup d'etat was
                            imminent. The background of these rumors, and the degree to which such
                            speculation could be realistic, is discussed in this airgram.</p>
                        <p>The Die Welt article, apparently written by its resident Rome
                            correspondent, Friedrich Meichsner, was first picked up in Italy by the
                            Florence daily newspaper La Nazione (independent conservative) on June
                            24. From the La Nazione summary, it appeared that the Die Welt article
                            foresaw the inevitable coming to power of the Italian Communist Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>), if present trends in Italy
                            continued. The German newspaper article apparently also discounted the
                            feasibility of a sharp turn to the right, which would only result in a
                            Communist victory in the end. The only solution, according to La
                            Nazione's account of the Die Welt story, was a continuation
                            of the center-left policy of social reform, but under the guidance of
                            other, more competent hands than those of then-incumbent center-left
                            government, and Die Welt urged that European encouragement and economic
                            support be given any Italian effort in such a direction. The Die Welt
                            article saw the Italian President, conservative Christian Democrat
                            Antonio Segni, as the only man able to step into the breach, and called
                            for “concrete and appropriate” steps, within and
                            outside of Italy, to save the country.</p>
                        <p>This apparent call for a Gaullist solution to Italy's current
                            difficulties was widely and very unfavorably reported in a broad range
                            of the Italian press from the conservative to the Communist end of the
                            political spectrum. Thus, while objecting to the exhortatory message in
                                <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0245"/>the Die Welt article, the
                            Italian press gave it heavy play. Within three days of the publication
                            of the Die Welt piece and the Nazione playback, quite sensational
                            reflections of the original article and of the Italian interest therein
                            were appearing in the local press. For example, on June 26, the
                            Christian Democrat daily of Rome Il Popolo picked up the following from
                            the Koelner Stadt-Anzieger:</p>
                        <p>“A state of alarm rule in Italy. Even in Government circles,
                            there is a frightening pessimism with regard to domestic political
                            developments. Inflation, corruption, and criminality in progressive
                            increase erode the faith of Italians in their country. Extreme
                            right-wing groups are already preparing for a coup d'etat,
                            with the support of military officers in active service.”</p>
                        <p>Similarly bleak assessments of Italy's current course were
                            reproduced from the French press, together with an alleged comparison of
                            the Italian situation with conditions in the Fourth Republic in 1958
                            attributed to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> himself.
                            At the same time, while the four-party negotiations for a new coalition
                            accord seemed to hang on dead center, it was made known that President
                            Segni had received (on July 13) the President of the Senate, Cesare
                            Merzagora, next in succession to the President of the Republic, for the
                            second time during the crisis, and that the President had also received
                            General Aldo Rossi, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Armed Forces (on
                            July 14), and Prime Minister-designate <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Aldo
                                Moro</persName> (on July 15). In the circumstances, these meetings
                            encouraged further speculation in increasingly dramatic and even ominous
                            overtones.</p>
                        <p>Finally, more contemplative articles as well as potboilers appeared in
                            several weekly reviews (L'Espresso, Folla, Epoca), keeping
                            the subject alive and playing upon the earlier rumors that a coup
                            d'etat was imminent.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Situation Behind the Rumors</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Behind the recent crisis and the talk of a coup d'etat lies a
                            postwar Italian history of tremendous efforts to raise a democratic
                            seedling in the stony ground left by the Fascist era and the
                            disillusionment and violence of the war. This postwar struggle to create
                            a viable democratic political and economic system has been further
                            complicated by the persistent efforts of the parties of the extreme
                            right and left to discredit the democratic system and the men dedicated
                            to its service. Despite the progress of the postwar years, and the
                            Italian “economic miracle,” the failure of the
                            governing parties to come to grips with many remaining economic and
                            social problems has led to a small but consistent increase in the
                            electoral strength of the Communists, a steady attrition of Christian
                            Democrat (<gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>) strength, and seemingly
                            growing public impatience with shortcomings which have perhaps in part
                            represented inherent national failures, but which have been
                            understandably <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0246"/>laid at the
                            political door of the center parties so long in power in Italy.</p>
                        <p>The impatience of the public with the present government by party
                            bureaucracies, or “partitocrazia,” has found
                            expression recently not only on the right and left extremes, but also by
                            more respectable elements such as Randolfo Pacciardi (see
                            Rome's A-1581 of May 14, 1964),<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12

                            known anti-Fascist, who now rejects the present system and has called
                            for the creation of a “Second Republic” in terms
                            which could also describe a Gaullist solution.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, both ideological and political leadership problems have
                            beset the democratic Italian parties in recent years, particularly the
                                <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>, due to differing political
                            interpretations of the significance of the growing left-wing vote, and
                            consequent steps necessary to recoup at least part of it into the
                            democratic area. A major complication was added when the Socialists
                                (<gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>) led by <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Pietro Nenni</persName> after long and difficult
                            efforts, moved far enough away from the influence of the Italian
                            Communists to be accepted, after bitter factional leadership struggles
                            within the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>, into the controversial
                            Italian center-left government experiment of the past few years. The
                            immediate significance, quickly made apparent, was that instead of just
                            one major governing political party torn by internal strife, Italy
                            became the proud owner of two. And, despite the encouraging note struck
                            by the reform-oriented program of the first <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> Government, internal party problems and the
                            pressure of the serious economic situation combined to saddle a most
                            unimpressive record on the first center-left government, which fell on
                            June 27.</p>
                        <p>Seldom was there a time like this one in postwar Italian history when so
                            many diverse elements could agree, rightly or wrongly, that the record
                            of democratic government in Italy had left much to be desired. Any
                            external call for a Gaullist solution was certain to receive attention
                            in view of the internal situation which set the stage for it. Against
                            this kind of background, we can examine the coup rumors and try to
                            evaluate them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Factors Militating Against a Coup</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The practical factors operating against a coup were more impressive,
                            however, than the psychological factors which suggested the possibility
                            of a coup to Die Welt.</p>
                        <p>As far as concerns a coup from the right, there is a long Italian
                            military tradition of refraining from extra-legal action to influence or
                            control the government. Additionally, there is a deeply rooted
                            anti-Fascist <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0247"/>sentiment in Italy
                            which would make popular support extremely unlikely in the absence of
                            careful preparation of public opinion by respectable leadership
                            elements. Such preparation would have to take place in circumstances
                            much more discouraging to democratic opinion than the situation existing
                            at the end of June. And any attempt by rightist elements to seize power
                            in Italy without the overwhelming support of public opinion could not be
                            successful under present conditions without widespread violence and
                            possibly outright civil war.</p>
                        <p>On the left, the leadership of the strong and well-organized Italian
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>) is well aware that
                            a Communist coup de main would unify domestic and foreign opposition and
                            thus probably turn the attempt into a disaster similar to the abortive
                            Greek Communist postwar attempt under “General
                            Markos”; which vicarious lesson Togliatti has publicly cited
                            for the benefit of Party militants. The current status of readiness, the
                            political reliability, and the heavier weapons made available in recent
                            years to the Italian Carabinieri underline Togliatti's point.
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> caution would militate against
                            taking the initiative for a coup d'etat unless reaction from
                            Italy's allies were unlikely, and unless reaction at home
                            could be quickly and quietly controlled.</p>
                        <p>However, Italian reaction to a coup from the right without overwhelming
                            popular support would hand over to the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> a broad range of democratic anti-Fascist elements of
                            the public. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> would then either
                            have to join hands with any spontaneous reaction, to meet force with
                            force, or abandon a popular cause in circumstances which would destroy
                            whatever image the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has in Italy as a
                            defender of freedom, an inflexibly anti-Fascist force, vanguard and
                            protector of the working class, etc. The bold action the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has mounted on previous occasions, when
                            moving with the mainstream of public opinion, leaves little doubt as to
                            the likely <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> decision in such a
                            situation. While unlikely to resort to a coup which the public would
                            oppose, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> would almost certainly
                            take to the barricades, with popular support and approval, in reaction
                            to any coup from the right.</p>
                        <p>In short, there is no power vacuum or dangerous imbalance of power in
                            Italy. On the contrary, there is a relatively stable balance of forces.
                            A coup from the left would have little chance of success, and it is all
                            too clear that an attempted coup from the right would be likely to lead
                            to violence or civil war which might present the unwelcome alternatives
                            of Communism or, as a large segment of the population would see it,
                            “Fascism”. The situation in Italy does not favor
                            adventure. On the contrary, democratic leadership elements know from
                            past experience that they would have to react quickly to any
                            ill-considered move on the political right, or be prepared to witness a
                            popular reaction ready-made for Communist exploitation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>One possible course, toward a Gaullist solution which might avoid the
                            instability almost certain to follow any coup de main, was outlined in
                            an article by Livio Pesce, carried in the Epoca issue of July 12,
                            following a line of thought generally attributed to Randolfo Pacciardi.
                            This possible course would have to be initiated by the President (as
                            suggested in fact by Die Welt), and would carefully exploit the
                            framework of the Italian Constitution, thus presenting the natural
                            opposition with the alternatives of acquiescence, or acceptance of the
                            onus and consequent political isolation which would stem from resorting
                            first to the threat of force.</p>
                        <p>At a point of “insoluble” crisis, as <hi rend="italic">Epoca</hi> puts it, the President could appoint (under
                            Article 92 of the Constitution) a Prime Minister and Cabinet without
                            reference to the party politicians; a Government of “national
                            unity” composed of “personalities of authority,
                            sensible and patriotic, ready to work with the President hellip; for the
                            good of the nation.” This of course would be entirely
                            constitutional. But Article 94 says that “the Government must
                            have the confidence of both Chambers [of the
                                Parliament].”<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Brackets in the
                                source text.</note> As <hi rend="italic">Epoca</hi> resolved the
                            problem, the President would have to carry Parliament with him by
                            “a solemn and dramatic appeal to the parties and to the
                            nation; an appeal to the people for the salvation of the
                            country.” A combination of an appeal from the President, the
                            image projected by his Prime Minister-designate, and the lack of
                            acceptable non-violent alternatives would then have to carry the day and
                            also provide the political consensus for an orderly transition to
                            whatever new forms were envisaged as the next step.</p>
                        <p>All this is familiar and required little imagination in view of recent
                            French history. However, it does not fit present circumstances in

                        </p>
                        <p>A new look at the alarmist speculation was taken by several commentators
                            after the crisis had passed, once the new four-party accords were
                            achieved on July 18, on the basis of which the second <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> government was subsequently formed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Pietro Nenni</persName>, in an Avanti
                            editorial, maintained that the alternative to the new center-left
                            government would have been an emergency government, of
                            “disinterested servants of the state,” which in
                            reality would have been a government of the right, with a
                            Fascist-agrarian-industrialist content. Ugo La Malfa in <hi rend="italic">La Voce Repubblicana</hi> noted (on July 27) that
                            after the center-left had been re-constituted, it became easy to read
                            assessments which dismissed <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0249"/>lightly the earlier talk of a coup. But, La Malfa observed, the
                            maneuvers and counter-maneuvers in the dramatic atmosphere of the crisis
                            were well designed to draw the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> to the
                            right, toward a reactionary adventure. The extreme right-wing satirical
                            weekly Il <hi rend="italic"> Borghese </hi> apparently felt that a
                            Gaullist formula had been within reach, and the July 23 issue strongly
                            criticized President <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> for
                            “betraying” the country's faith in him
                            by re-designating <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Aldo Moro</persName> to
                            form a (second) center-left government, and for failing to remove the
                            Communist threat in Italy as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> did in France in 1958.</p>
                        <p>Other heads saw the matter differently, once the crisis was resolved.
                            Giovanni Spadolini, of Bologna's conservative <hi rend="italic"> Resto del Carlino </hi>, owned by the same financial
                            group that controls La Nazione, which started the original flurry of
                            articles, criticized <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> for his
                            statement that the alternative to a new center-left government had been
                            an authoritarian reactionary government which was ready to be launched.
                            According to Spadolini, there had been too much talk of authoritarian
                            solutions. Italy “is neither Bolivia nor Santo
                            Domingo.” President <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> had no choice but to call on <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> to form a government, and in the
                            event of failure by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> would have had to explore
                            alternate democratic solutions before, as a last resort, calling
                            elections. Spadolini expressed full confidence in President <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> as “the supreme
                            guarantee of constitutional and democratic legality,” and
                            dismissed the criticisms from the right and left as “absurd
                            and senseless.” From the other side of the political
                            spectrum, moderately left-wing (left-Radical) l'Espresso
                            joined Spadolini in rejecting <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>'s pessimistic view and the rumors of a
                            possible coup, saying flatly (on August 2) that “the
                            hypothesis of a coup d'etat had no possibility of
                            realization;” that the far right continues to hopefully
                            cultivate the idea, but that their hopes are not soundly based in the
                            realities of Italian circumstances.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Embassy believes that Spadolini and l'Espresso are clearly
                            the better Monday morning quarterbacks in their assessments of the
                            situation as it was and is, and we agree that there is little likelihood
                            of a coup d'etat in Italy at this stage of its post-war
                            history. This is not to deny that cries of dissatisfaction and
                            disillusionment with the system in Italy have become louder in recent
                            years as a result of the failure of a succession of post-war governments
                            to move quickly towards reducing inefficiency and corruption in
                            government, to meet the pace of increasing Italian expectations, and to
                            contain the increasing electoral voting threat on the left. Talk of a
                            “Second Republic” has been stimulated mildly by
                            the Pacciardi movement, but the situation is not as yet such as to
                            create a consensus prepared to reject a system which has served many
                            diverse elements well during the post-war years. In these <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0250"/>circumstances, the tradition and
                            reliability of the armed forces, the strong anti-Fascist popular
                            sentiment, the balance of forces of political elements with the country,
                            the caution and lack of capability of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> to mount a quick and clean-cut coup, and the absence of
                            a “strong man” to attract the popular imagination
                            constitute formidable obstacles to any illegal seizure of power. If
                            public disillusionment continues to grow, as it will in the long run if
                            the ability of democratic parties to govern and improve economic
                            conditions is not firmly asserted, conditions favorable to a Gaullist
                            solution could develop. In the absence of the necessary conditioning of
                            broad segments of the public which would be essential not only to a
                            Gaullist solution, but also to a coup from the left or the right, there
                            remains only the more remote possibility of an ill-conceived attempt,
                            without the elements of success, but which could lead to violence with
                            political consequences. There has been no evidence of any militant
                            dissatisfaction from any quarter both strong enough and rash enough to
                            stake all on such a forlorn hope.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>I want to write a word to you regarding the way we see developments
                            moving in Italian policy toward Communist China.</p>
                        <p>As you know, and as we have reported repeatedly, <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> has assured me that in the
                            forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly Italy
                            will support the United States view that the Chinese representation
                            issue is an “important question” and that Italy
                            will not vote for seating Communist China at this session of the General
                            Assembly. I have no doubt that this will remain the Italian
                            position—for this coming session.</p>
                        <p>It is important to bear in mind that these assurances have carefully been
                            limited to the forthcoming session and it has been pointed <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0251"/>out that they do not necessarily apply
                            to the future beyond that time. These assurances have also been given
                            against a background of repeated reminders that Italy is convinced the
                            time is rapidly approaching when a new look must be taken at its policy
                            regarding Chinese recognition. In our conversations with responsible
                            Italian officials here there are also constant allusions to alleged
                            rising internal economic and political pressures calling for a
                            recognition of Communist China. Although we can and have demonstrated
                            repeatedly by statistics that the economic advantages to Chinese
                            Communist recognition are largely illusory, it must be admitted that
                            there are still some pressures nonetheless from Italian business and
                            industrial concerns favoring Chinese Communist recognition. The main
                            issue-and here the matter is much more complex and much less susceptible
                            to statistical refutation, is the internal political pressure from many
                            quarters, particularly from the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>, for
                            recognition, as well as a general and growing feeling that Italy, by
                            continuing to support the United States position, is on a slippery slope
                            and is backing, without conviction, a losing proposition.</p>
                        <p>We have come into possession of information in strictest confidence from
                            a source which I consider to be completely reliable concerning <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>'s conversation with
                            Spaak during Spaak's last visit here. Reportedly there were
                            the following significant elements in the conversation:</p>
                        <p>(1) Both <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> and Spaak referred
                            to growing strong internal pressures favoring Communist Chinese
                            recognition. Spaak is said to have told <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> that in Belgium only he, Spaak, is keeping
                            Belgium on its present course.</p>
                        <p>(2) Both <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> and Spaak agreed
                            that, although Italy and Belgium will support the United States position
                            at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly,
                            both countries have “decided” that they will
                            recognize Communist China in the not too distant future. It was not
                            excluded that one or both countries might make explanatory statements to
                            this general effect in connection with the positions they might be
                            called upon to take in the General Assembly this year. It was noted that
                            Canada might be in a similar position and should be consulted
                            privately.</p>
                        <p>(3) Both <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> and Spaak agreed
                            that the changes in Italian and Belgian policy would not be taken
                            without full and frank prior conversations with the United States. Both
                            agreed they wished to avoid acting in the manner in which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had carried out his change of
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>(4) The way in which the conversation flowed from a discussion by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> of Italy's
                            intention to support and participate in the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> to a discussion immediately thereafter of the attitude
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> and the Italian
                            Socialists favoring recognition of Communist China led some <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0252"/>among the Belgians to conclude that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> may have been thinking
                            that Italian government agreement to recognize Communist China would be
                            the price for Italian Socialist acceptance of <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(5) Spaak urged that the United States should be informed privately at
                            once of the Italian and Belgian “decision” to
                            recognize Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, on the other hand, argued that, while, of course,
                            the United States must be informed as soon as possible and full
                            discussions should be held with the United States before any action were
                            taken, the matter should not be broached even privately with the United
                            States until after the United States presidential elections.</p>
                        <p>I have noted from a number of reporting cables various straws in the wind
                            which point in the direction of the information I have just set forth.
                            Now, Malfatti has told us directly that Italy is rethinking its position
                            as we have reported in our telegram 1291.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">Dated November 11. (Ibid., Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> CHICOM IT)</note> My purpose in
                            writing to you is to bring to your attention—and through you
                            to the attention of others whom you may consider
                            appropriate—what I consider to be authentic information
                            indicating the lines along which I believe Italian policy is developing.
                            I doubt that the Italians will be responsive much longer to United
                            States exhortations and arguments on this subject. While wishing to take
                            their contemplated action in such a manner so as to minimize the damage
                            to the United States and the strain on US-Italian relations, I believe
                            that the Italians have taken a decision in principle to move on this
                            matter. To the extent that they are able to do so in coordination with
                            Belgium and possibly Canada, they will be strengthened in their resolve
                            to move forward with this change in policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">In a November 26 letter to <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> commented: “I think your analysis
                                leaves little doubt but that in the longer run, the Italian

                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> is sincere
                            about this; but I know that he also expects us not to make any changes
                            in United States policy with regard to Chinese recognition or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> admission without informing the Italian
                            government about it at the very earliest possible time. He is

                            fears that if Italy were to be taken by surprise by any such US policy
                            shift, the Italian government would be laid open to criticism from the
                            Italian Left of lagging behind “even the United
                            States” on this issue.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>This is a brief report of a lunch I had alone on January 12 with my old
                            friend <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Sergio Fenoaltea</persName>, the
                            Italian Ambassador, on his invitation. He wanted to talk about the
                                <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. I told him I had been
                            completely out of touch with developments for over two months.
                            Nevertheless, he pursued the topic with pertinacity and dolor. He said
                            he was most unhappy over the shift in the US position which he had first
                            learned of through Scotty Reston's column some weeks ago on
                            the President's injunction.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">
                                Reston's column appeared in <hi rend="italic">The New
                                    York Times</hi>, December 21, 1964. For documentation on U.S.

                                    Documents 49</ref>-<ref target="frus1964-68v13#d67">67</ref>.</note> I said I had read the article and other news
                            stories but had not seen the memo if indeed it existed. <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Sergio</persName> went on to say that
                            “The US had pulled the rug out from under the Germans
                            (particularly Schroeder) and also members of the Italian government
                            favoring it. The Germans were very unhappy. Even if the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> was a poor idea (and he himself thought
                            it a very good one) the US should have pursued it with constancy once we
                            had committed ourselves to it. To shift gears cost us confidence in many
                            ways. Moreover, it appeared we were appeasing deGaulle-even giving him a
                            veto,” etc. I replied that our basic position on the problem
                            and on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>—to my
                            knowledge—had not changed. No one should doubt our constancy.
                            The <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> had always been an attempt to
                            meet an asserted European problem. Moreover, I said that there had been
                            two major new elements in the situation in recent weeks. First, the new
                            Labor Government had been elected in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and was striving to abandon its national nuclear
                            deterrent. Surely it was only sensible to consider most carefully
                            British proposals to this end which could result in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participation in an <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. If the Germans and Italians disliked
                            certain of the British ideas it was far more effective for them to tell
                            the British so directly rather than for us to object on the basis that
                            the Germans or Italians would not like this or that. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s attitude had
                            shifted from indifference to open hostility toward the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> with the veiled threat that
                            he'd pull the pillars of the Temple down if it became a fact.
                            Surely time should be allotted to ensure that he understood the basic
                            concept and the intention <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0254"/>to
                            leave it open for later French adherence. I added I knew of no
                            willingness to accord the French a veto over any or all actions in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Sergio</persName> then referred to a statement
                            in President Johnson's speech<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">For
                                text, see Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States:
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1965,
                                Book I, pp. 1-9.</note> to the effect our policy was not based on an
                            “abstract design” and asked if he should attach
                            great significance to this as portending a basic change in US policy
                            toward Europe. I said “certainly not—that this was
                            language reflecting Mr. Johnson's pragmatic approach to
                            problems.” He agreed.</p>
                        <p>Sergio then shifted to East-West relations and talked interestingly on
                            the dangers to Italy (&amp; France) which had large Communist
                            parties of overemphasizing polycentrism in the European satellites and
                            deemphasizing the inherent evils of communism as an ideology.</p>
                        <p>Finally, he reverted to one of his chronic themes that the US cannot and
                            must not leave the Europeans to make important decisions alone. US
                            influence and leadership is needed.</p>
                        <p>It was a long and interesting lunch. Despite all my efforts he was still
                            in a melancholy mood when I left, for he has stuck his own professional
                            neck out very far on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I leave it to you to give this note such distribution as you think it
                            should have.</p>

                                Senate. The white paper was “Aggression From the
                                North,” released February 27. Its contents are summarized
                                in <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d171">

                                    Document 171</ref>.</note> The Secretary expressed warm
                            appreciation for the helpful statements that the Prime Minister had made
                            despite his political problems.</p>
                        <p>Noting this appreciation, the Ambassador stated that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> had courageously pointed to Hanoi
                            as the root of the trouble in Viet-Nam. By its military action against
                            South Viet-Nam through infiltration, the U.S. had been forced to reply
                            acting with and on behalf of Saigon. The Ambassador added that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> is mindful of the potential danger
                            of the situation and has welcomed U.S. assurances that we do not wish to
                            see the conflict spread. Italy has not taken any initiative in trying to
                            bring about a settlement of the conflict but is not indifferent to the
                            problem and stands ready to cooperate if the occasion to be helpful
                            should arise.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing, the Prime Minister had requested the
                            Ambassador to obtain our latest views on the situation in Viet-Nam,
                            including an evaluation of the various political initiatives that have
                            recently been taken, notably by the British and French, whose views,
                            however, seemed to differ somewhat. The Ambassador hoped a common
                            approach to the problem consistent with Allied solidarity can be worked
                            out. He thought a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> review of the
                            situation might be helpful, in connection with which he noted with
                            satisfaction Ambassador Unger's recent briefing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then reviewed our position on Viet-Nam along the lines of
                            his news conference of February 25.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">For text

                                836-838.</note> He said that his opening statements in particular
                            expressed clearly what the crux of our policy on Viet-Nam is and hoped
                            that the Italian Government had been furnished with a text. The
                            Ambassador replied he had sent copies of the entire text. As he had
                            stressed at his news conference, the Secretary said that the missing
                            piece in a solution of the Viet-Nam problem is <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0256"/>Hanoi's willingness to
                            terminate its aggression in South Viet-Nam and leave its neighbor in
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Channels to Communists Open</hi>—The
                            Secretary also wished to stress that channels to the Communists to
                            discuss Viet-Nam are open—the French through Hanoi, the
                            British as Co-Chairman with Soviets on Laos, ourselves with Peiping via
                            Warsaw, etc. Thus, there is no lack of communications, but so far none
                            of these contacts has revealed any evidence of Hanoi's
                            willingness to abandon its aggression by infiltration and terrorism
                            against South Viet-Nam. Therefore, the question of negotiations takes on
                            a special meaning. Negotiations leading to surrender in South Viet-Nam
                            are, of course, out of the question. If formal negotiations were started
                            and then failed, this failure could lead to a more serious situation and
                            wider conflict, since a way out through negotiations would have already
                            been exhausted. In this connection, the Secretary pointed out that
                            previous successful negotiations with the Communists (end of Berlin
                            blockade, Laos Agreement, Test Ban Treaty, etc.) have been preceded by
                            private talks indicating a genuine willingness to reach a mutually
                            satisfactory agreement. There has been no such indication resulting from
                            contacts with Hanoi. The French, for instance, have asked the North
                            Vietnamese point blank if they were willing to stop their aggression in
                            South Viet-Nam but have received no answer. Both French and British
                            approaches have not reflected the possibility of success in terms
                            acceptable to the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The United States has more reason than any other Western country for a
                            successful resolution of the problem, but a peaceful solution is
                            impossible if only one side wants it. As the President and Secretary
                            have reiterated on innumerable occasions, we will withdraw our forces
                            tomorrow if Hanoi will honestly guarantee to let South Viet-Nam alone.
                            Meanwhile, as the President has affirmed, the United States is prepared
                            to take all appropriate and adequate measures to stay on until Hanoi
                            shows its readiness for peace.</p>

                            </hi>—The Secretary suggested that in his discussions of the
                            Viet-Nam problem, the Prime Minister might helpfully underline what
                            North Viet-Nam is doing to South Viet-Nam in the way of massive
                            infiltration and terrorism and to express confidence that the United
                            States will withdraw just as soon as North Viet-Nam stops its aggressive
                            interference. The Ambassador stated <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> has been doing this and that our White Paper is
                            helpful in this regard. The Secretary commented that our French friends,
                            for instance, express concern about our air strikes but make no mention
                            of North Vietnamese provocation in South Viet-Nam, which makes a
                            troublesome imbalance. Even the Buddhists in South Viet-Nam, who are
                            keen for a peaceful settlement, base it on demands that both the North
                            Vietnamese and Americans go home, and have told us privately that they
                            support our air strikes even if religious considerations prevent them
                            from saying so in public.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Clarification of Point in U.S. White
                            Paper</hi>—The Ambassador referred to a statement in our
                            White Paper on Viet-Nam to the effect that the United States and South
                            Viet-Nam would continue their military efforts until either North
                            Viet-Nam ceased its aggression or other measures were taken to assure
                            the peace and security of the area. The Ambassador wondered about the
                            significance of the “or” clause. The Secretary
                            explained that the “either” clause carried 99
                            percent of the weight of the sentence. The “or”
                            clause had been added so as to leave a door technically open to the
                            possibility of some sort of international action, possibly through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, etc., but that possibility seemed small.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Significance of the Soviet Role</hi>—The
                            Ambassador asked if the Secretary regarded the latest reaction from
                            Moscow to our air strikes as more violent than the others, perhaps
                            portending stiffer Soviet action? The Secretary replied that the Soviet
                            record in South East Asia in the past has demonstrated a Soviet desire
                            to avoid a confrontation in the area with the United States. The
                            Sino-Soviet conflict, however, has become a complicating factor in
                            solving problems with the Soviets in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            since the Soviets are under pressure to take steps strong enough to
                            match the Chinese Communist. Therefore, the possibility of substantial
                            Soviet military aid to Hanoi cannot be excluded. The Secretary thought,
                            however, that the tenor of Moscow's reaction to our air
                            strikes has been about what could be expected under the circumstances.
                            He added that <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0258"/>we were sorry
                            that the February 9 strikes occurred while <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was in Hanoi, and it was not the United States
                            which planned it that way. In short, the Secretary said we cannot say
                            for sure what the Soviets may do.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador wondered if we were forced as a deterrent measure to
                            strike further north in North Viet-Nam, whether that might not bring the
                            Chinese Communists directly into the hostilities. The Secretary replied
                            that there is no sure answer to such a question. The North Vietnamese
                            probably fear a horde of Chinese coming into their country but, on the
                            other hand, desire to take over South Viet-Nam. Who can tell which
                            emotion would dominate? The Secretary did think, however, that if Hanoi
                            fails to pull back, the situation can become more serious.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Stability of Political Situation in South
                            Viet-Nam</hi>—The Ambassador asked about the prospects for
                            greater political stability in South Viet-Nam and mused whether the
                            Viet-Cong might not eventually win by a political takeover rather than
                            by military means.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary regretted the effects of fourteen months of political
                            instability in Hanoi [Saigon], which has made a bad impression abroad,
                            including the United States, and sent the wrong kind of signal to Hanoi
                            about the ability of South Viet-Nam to continue to resist. We hope very
                            much that the current Saigon regime will endure, but in light of past
                            events, cannot say for sure. In this connection, the Secretary pointed
                            out that political commotion in Saigon affects only a comparatively few
                            people and that traditionally the rural areas in South Viet-Nam are not
                            too greatly affected by what happens in the capital. In areas in the
                            countryside where the security of the population (about 75 percent) is
                            assured, the villages and towns have cooperated satisfactorily with
                            Saigon. In conclusion, the Secretary said that while the situation is
                            not good, still it is not necessarily on the brink of collapse.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Possibility of Italian Assistance</hi>—The
                            Ambassador again referred to the fact that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> has not proposed an Italian
                            initiative but does not remain indifferent to the seriousness of the
                            situation. The Ambassador wondered, therefore, if there were not
                            something useful that the Italians might be doing now to express their
                            willingness to cooperate. The Secretary said he appreciated this
                            willingness, but could not think of anything they could do at this
                            particular juncture.</p>
                        <p>As he had already explained, we do have the channels for sounding out the
                            Communists on Viet-Nam but so far none of the soundings has produced any
                            satisfactory results.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that if the French through their contacts with
                            Peiping and Hanoi succeeded in persuading the North Vietnamese to
                            withdraw, would that not prove the value of maintaining such contacts.
                            The Secretary replied that if the French so succeeded that <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0259"/>would be fine, but so far there is no
                            evidence of such success. He thought it important that our friends,
                            including the French, first think about the desired results in Viet-Nam
                            and then decide on how to achieve them. If Paris, for instance, equates
                            the neutralization of South Viet-Nam with Communist domination of South
                            East Asia, that, of course, would not be an acceptable result for the
                            Free World. We can accept South Vietnamese and other South East Asian
                            peoples being non-aligned quite happily, but we cannot sanction their
                            being taken over by the Communist camp against their will.</p>

                        <p>Dear Walker:</p>
                        <p>We were concerned to learn, from your letter of February 18, that you had
                            seen an uncleared policy paper that argues that Western European
                            Communist parties including the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> are
                            changing and at some point will probably be acceptable partners within
                            the governing coalitions.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">Neither the letter
                                nor the paper has been found.</note> We presume that you will oppose
                            clearing any such paper, and we hope that the arguments we have
                            furnished—for example, in our A-1828 of June 30, 1964<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">Not printed. (National Archives and Records

                            in case it might prove useful, however, I am summarizing below the
                            arguments against the wishful thinking which promotes the theory here
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> wolf is becoming a harmless
                            and useful sheep.</p>

                        <p>The rationale, here in Italy, concerning the evolution of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> toward respectability and
                            acceptability, generally leans heavily on one or more of the following
                            weak “logical” reeds:</p>

                            excellent reason to exclude the Communists from power here. But it is
                            not the only reason. The continued diminution eventually perhaps even to
                            something approaching zero, of any such link with Moscow would not make
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> acceptable or worthy of trust.
                            They would remain a totalitarian party; as totalitarian as the Fascist
                            MSI, and considerably more dangerous. We believe that it suffices to
                            point out that the Yugoslav League of Communists (LCY) is quite
                            independent of Moscow and since 1948 has made tremendous strides toward
                            reconciling itself with the Yugoslav people, but it remains
                            Marxist-Leninist, and after almost 17 years of independence from Moscow
                            the Yugoslav people are still offered no political alternative
                            whatsoever to the LCY. There is no evidence to support any conclusion
                            that a fully autonomous <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> would
                            perform any more democratically than the LCY.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is evolving
                                toward democracy, and once fully democratic there would be no reason
                                to exclude the Communists from the exercise of power.</hi> This
                            fallacy is based on a false premise. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is not evolving toward democracy. Steps have been taken
                            from time to time to improve the workings of the system and (hopefully,
                            from the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> point of view) to give the
                            cadres more of a feeling of participation in the Party decision-making
                            apparatus. These are agitprop exercises, and the rest of the scanty
                            appearances of <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> democratization are
                            no more than a well propagandized illusion. Party leaders have said
                            again and again that no matter how much the democratic left-wing calls
                            for Communist abandonment of democratic centralism, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> will continue to consider democratic
                            centralism the keystone of the Party principles of organization. In this
                            sense the Leninist orthodoxy of the Party is impeccable. And it goes
                            without saying that on this subject the views of Rosa Luxemburg stated
                            60 years ago (see Luxemburg's Centralism or Democracy) still
                            demand our careful consideration. She correctly predicted that
                            democratic centralism and Party democracy would prove to be completely
                            antithetical, and history has shown her to have been correct. The
                            leaders of the democratic left-wing parties here know, and it more than
                            ever behooves us to keep in mind, that no partial measures short of
                            complete abandonment of Leninist organization can ever democratize the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>. The argument can of course be
                            made, convincing or not, that the lack of democracy within the Party
                            need not preclude its acting in a democratic manner with respect to
                            other parties. However, the statements of the Party (for Party
                            consumption and therefore <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0261"/>asserted seriously) leave no room for doubt on this score. The
                            statements of Pietro Ingrao which were quoted in our A-1828 make it
                            clear that the leopard has no intention of changing its spots, despite
                            the propaganda to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Inherent <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> tendencies
                                toward autonomy and democracy can be stimulated and brought to
                                fruition by gradually bringing the Party into the democratic area
                                and offering responsibility to the Communists as they prove
                                themselves ready for it.</hi> Of course this view would not be
                            reflected in any paper prepared in Washington, but it is properly a part
                            of this letter because it represents a logical construction on the
                            fundamental misconceptions listed above. And notwithstanding the
                            political absurdity of this sort of thought, we are sometimes hit with
                            arguments of this type which, for example, regret our
                            “shortsightedness” for not speeding up the
                                “<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            evolution” by recognizing the respectability of Giorgio
                            Amendola, etc. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, let me say that we
                            find it quite easy to bear in mind that if the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> leaders were demonstrably autonomous and 24 karat
                            democrats, their domestic and foreign policy programs would
                            automatically exclude them from any sort of practical consideration as
                            partners in an Italian coalition. The problems inherent in the present
                            center-left coalition provide sufficient examples. It is difficult to
                            imagine the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> moving to the right of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> positions as they are today, but
                            without such a movement by the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, the
                            Communists could contribute nothing to a program which would also have
                            to find acceptance outside the Marxist area. Putting it another way, the
                            Catholics recognize that a “dialogue” with
                            Leninist Communists is impossible unless the Catholics care to move
                            toward Communist positions; see, for example, L'Impossible
                            Dialogo tra Cattolici e Communisti, Father Giuseppe De Rosa, S.J., in
                            Civilta Cattolica of October 17, 1964, or the recent broadside by the
                            Vatican Osservatore Romano. As Father De Rosa said, there is no common
                            ground—political, philosophical, religious, or social. And
                            the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has repeatedly asserted it will
                            not abandon its tenets in all these areas.</p>
                        <p>It is not surprising that the Catholics, the <gloss target="#t_PSDI1">PSDI</gloss>, and all parties to the right of them have rejected
                            cooperation with a party that remains a wolf in sheep's
                            clothing; a party that is not evolving toward democracy; a party that is
                            only slightly less objectionable as a result of its growing autonomy; a
                            party with which it would be impossible to fashion a useful democratic
                            program, even if sincerity and trustworthiness could be assumed. We
                            believe the democratic parties have been wise in rejecting the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> to date.</p>
                        <p>We don't see any convincing evidence that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is changing, and much convincing
                            evidence that it is not. We don't know, therefore, to what
                            democratic parties the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> might
                            ultimately become acceptable as a coalition partner, but we are certain
                            that in terms of US policy <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0262"/>interests and in the interests of liberty and democracy for our
                            allies, the Communists will remain unacceptable unless and until they
                            become fully autonomous, scrap Lenin's democratic centralist
                            structure, and adopt and support programs which reflect national needs
                            rather than narrow doctrinal or power interests. But would the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> then be a Communist Party?</p>
                        <p>The way to deal with the Communists, it seems to us, is to isolate them
                            from the government and keep them so until the government has taken
                            measures to improve social and economic conditions in Italy. Then it is
                            to be hoped that their voting strength will fall off, for two reasons,
                            as <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> noted the other day: (1)
                            voters will have less to protest about and (2) they will see that the
                            Communists, absent from the “control room” can do
                            nothing directly to influence the government's program. To
                            let the Communists into the government would remove this avenue of
                            (hopefully) diminishing their voting strength.</p>
                        <p>We feel strongly enough about this to wish to call the paper to which you
                            refer to John Di Sciullo's attention, and I am therefore
                            sending a copy of this letter to him. We hope both of you can take a
                            thoroughly skeptical view of any paper that claims to see any meaningful
                            steps toward democracy by the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>. We
                            would be the first to be delighted by such a trend, in view of the
                            threat the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> constitutes in Italy, but
                            what we have observed to date is basically not <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> evolution, but wishful thinking encouraged by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>.</p>

                            Communist threat.</p>
                        <p>Majority of <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> (including <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>) have no illusions concerning

                            for Italian democracy. Nevertheless, important elements of <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>, including factions led by Foreign

                            establish “dialogue” between Catholics and <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, i.e. a debate which would lead to

                        <p>Indications of Pope's displeasure in March 31 audience, and
                            subsequent strong warnings by Vatican's Osservatore Romano
                            and Jesuit Civilta Cattolica against <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> collaboration should
                            put to rest trend toward dangerous assumption that it possible for

                        <p>Strong Vatican position will have salutary effect at least for immediate

                            benefit from climate of Vatican reaction and at same time contribute to

                            believes this is appropriate time for US encourage <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> to hold line against Italian

                            of other Communist parties and which are changing to adapt to
                            contemporary world. These phenomena are major subject of debate among
                            democratic parties in Italy, where the issues are obscured by desire of
                            some democratic elements to reject out of hand all reports of change,
                            autonomy, or national motivation in <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>.
                            Facts are that <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> leaders are

                            important that we recognize the real elements of difference and change
                            in <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, bearing carefully in mind that
                            in terms of basic nature and goals, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> is and will remain an unacceptable totalitarian

                            principal current problem areas of <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            question:</p>
                        <p>Autonomy. <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> policy is linked to Moscow
                            but substantial autonomy does exist, and trend in international movement
                            is toward increasing degree autonomy. Pertinent question in Italy is:
                            will <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> be <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0264"/>acceptable for cooperation with democratic parties if
                            and when <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> can be considered
                            autonomous? Answer is that if <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> were
                            autonomous, it would still have to be judged on its domestic Italian
                            attributes. And by <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>'s own
                            statements, these attributes are and will continue to be
                            Marxist-Leninist in organization and philosophy. They will include
                            materialism, economic determinism, democratic centralism, Marxist
                            concepts of history and truth, and the range of Communist theory and
                            practice which is irreconcilable with democratic institutions.</p>
                        <p>Democracy. <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> strategy to seek power by
                            parliamentary means has been exploited also by the Communists to project
                            false image of respectable democratic party. Additionally, imperatives
                            of membership appeal and popular image push <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> toward increasing semblance of democracy in internal
                            and external practice. However, <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            Leninist control formula (democratic centralism) is authoritarian, and
                            party consistently asserts that democratic centralism is basic to <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> procedure. As long as party holds to
                            Leninist totalitarian concepts, <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            cannot be democratic internally or in its relations with other Italian
                            parties. Moreover, lack of <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            democratic intent has been made abundantly clear by party leaders,
                            despite effective propaganda to the contrary (see A-1828 June 30,
                                1964).<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">See <ref target="#d107fn3">footnote 3, Document 107</ref>.</note>

                        <p>These are some observations that I hope that you would consider in regard
                            to the visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is very anxious for this visit to be a success from
                            both his standpoint and yours. As you know, I spoke rather sharply to
                            the Italian Ambassador after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">New York <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0265"/>Times</hi> story
                            about his alleged remarks on Viet Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">An
                                apparent reference to <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>
                                article by Reston of April 11. No record of <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>'s conversation
                                with <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> has been
                                found.</note> The Italian Ambassador was very upset about it and
                            insisted that this was a speculative story. He later conveyed to me that
                            he passed along to the Prime Minister my conversation with him. The
                            Prime Minister declared the story to be entirely speculative and not at
                            all the sort of thing he would be saying.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is in a difficult political situation. The <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> Socialist Party (<gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>) cannot be too accommodating or else
                                <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> will lose his
                            effectiveness as well as his following. It is vital to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> that the <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> Socialists remain allied to him because of the
                            substantial strength of the Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>As of now the Christian Democrats have a little less than half of the
                            majority in the Italian Parliament with the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> about 15% and the Communists about 25%. There is a
                            splinter group (<gloss target="#t_PSIUP1">PSIUP</gloss>) a little to the
                            left of the <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> and a little to the
                            right of the Communists. This group broke off from <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>'s Socialists when the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName> Socialists endorsed
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Therefore, the <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> posture is on a knife-edge and the
                            outcome of his meeting with you is very important to him.</p>
                        <p>Viet Nam is the one issue that threatens the <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>
                            relationship. Your Baltimore speech had a tremendously favorable impact
                            in Italy. It cut the propaganda ground out from under the Communists and
                            strengthened <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s
                            hand immeasurably.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wants to tell you about the Italian political
                            situation and of the moves that Italy is making to restore its economic
                            strength. He will be very circumspect about what is said in public about
                            Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>I think you will find out that you will be able to call the turn on this
                            and he would be willing to go along with your views—keeping
                            in mind, of course, that too strong a support of the U.S.-Viet Nam
                            policy would allow the Communists to make some hay.</p>
                        <p>If it is possible for you to consider the following, it would allow
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> to go back to Italy in a
                            stronger position than when he left:</p>
                        <p>(1) The President hopefully show great warmth and affection for <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> and Italy in some visible
                            way-perhaps a little longer than usual discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>, particularly private talks.
                            Hopefully, I will try to come up with some ideas for pictures and other
                            suggestions that will give evidence that the warmth of your welcome was
                            more than merely normal and procedural.</p>
                        <p>(2) Any background we can give the Press to emphasize the extreme
                            cordiality of the meeting and the President's genuine and
                            intense interest in Italy's problems and in
                            Italy's future.</p>
                        <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0266"/>
                        <p>You are scheduled to actually talk with him about 45 minutes. If this
                            could be stretched to say about an hour and a half even though <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> will be a little late to his
                            luncheon given by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> on April 20 it would be taken as a gesture of
                            warm interest on your part.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Italians are quite sensitive about their position in the European
                            power structure. It would be most helpful if your talk could underscore
                            the fact that the U.S. considers Italy to be part of a rectangle of
                            London, Paris, Bonn, and Rome. Like any human or nation that once tasted
                            great glory and then settled into a decline, the Italians thirst for
                            recognition as a nation to be reckoned with in the affairs of the
                            world.</p>

                            Washington April 20-21, 1965, for meetings with U.S. officials. In a

                            now substantially open to U.S. competition, as shown by the fact that
                            American films earn over 50% of total gross receipts in Italy.
                            Liberalization has been a function of greatly increased collaboration
                            between the United States and Italian film industries, particularly with
                            respect to production and financing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fineshriber and Mr. Hochstetter noted the strong political factors
                            which had influenced the motion picture bill as recently reported out of
                            the Parliamentary Commission. According to their information, the bill
                            will probably come up for action in the Chamber of Deputies by late
                            May.</p>
                        <p>The MPEAA's over-all assessment of the bill was that it
                            provided for entirely too much government regulation, and that it
                            contained too many elements of discrimination against foreign films.
                            They noted, however, that some of its undesirable features would have
                            little significance unless enforced by the Italian authorities in a
                            restrictive way. The manner of future implementation might depend in
                            part upon U.S. attitudes toward the new law. I.e. if the United States
                            should make a big issue of the law, the Italian film authorities could
                            be expected to react by enforcing it strictly, instead of by relaxing
                            its controls where this is left open to their discretion.</p>

                            that he was familiar with the manner in which this rebate has been in
                            violation of Italy's international trade commitments since
                            1949 (see CA-5560, 11/24/64).<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">Not printed.
                                (Ibid., INCO MOTION PICTURES-IT)</note> It was noted that the new
                            rebate formula was much more complex than the provision which had been
                            in effect since 1949, and that one could not say offhand whether the
                            general incidence of discrimination would be higher or lower. However,
                            one change would clearly sharpen the extent of discrimination; namely,
                            the fact that films from other <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            countries would henceforth be eligible for the rebates.</p>

                            23). The MPEAA representatives expressed some concern about the new
                            requirement to provide free of charge a copy of each new feature film
                            for possible “educational and cultural” showings
                            after 5 years. They recognized that the requirement apparently did not
                            discriminate between foreign and domestic films, and that it presumably
                            did not violate international commitments by Italy. Nevertheless, it did
                            represent a new form of government intervention.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Government intervention in terms of film rental
                                contracts</hi> (Article 41). The law permits the Ministry of Tourism
                            and Entertainment to fix the terms of private contracts, e.g., between
                            distributors and exhibitors, if the interested private parties do not
                            reach agreement. This was not a new feature of Italian legislation on
                            films, the MPEAA representatives noted, but it left open a wide field
                            for possible abuse by the Italian authorities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Cinema screen quota</hi> (Article 5). In the latest
                            version of the bill, Mr. Hochstetter reported, the screen quota
                            reserving time for films which qualify as national has been raised from
                            the traditional 25 days per quarter (about 28%) to 30 days per quarter
                            (about 33%). Under current market conditions, he said, the increased
                            quota would probably not hurt American exports any more than the
                            previous quota, since films currently qualifying as domestic were able
                            to command about 45% of the Italian market. Mr. Hochstetter had some
                            impression that this increase would be inconsistent with
                            Italy's commitments under the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. Mr. Thomson explained that this was not so, since
                            this quota had never been bound in trade negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Television screen quota</hi> (new Article 56). Another
                            restrictive new feature affecting television had been added to the bill,
                            Mr. Fineshriber reported. The bill would require that, of screen time
                            devoted to the broadcast <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0269"/>of
                            feature films (and this is normally a very small fraction of total
                            screen time), at least 50% must be reserved for national films. Mr.
                            Thomson commented that this provision, assuming its enactment, would be
                            a curious new departure, in that countries with state television
                            monopolies usually preferred to conceal trade-restrictive practices in
                            this field and to hide behind the fact of operation by the state.</p>
                        <p>A brief overview ensued of the compatibility of these provisions with
                            Italy's international trade commitments. As the MPEAA
                            representatives were aware, the American Embassy in Rome has already
                            taken the position in discussions with Italian officials, by instruction
                                (<gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>-5560), that any rebate of this
                            type was incompatible with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            (Article III), the U.S.-Italian <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss>
                            Treaty (Article XVI), and with the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Code on Current Invisibles.</p>
                        <p>As for the proposed increase in the cinema screen quota, it was noted
                            that this action would be compatible with what the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission had recently prescribed in
                            its Second Directive on films (Article 5—see Brussels <gloss target="#t_ECBUS1">ECBUS</gloss> A-722, 4/15/65).<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., ECIN 3 <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>)</note> Assuming that the new law would go into
                            effect at an early date, the Italians would thus be complying with this
                            directive in advance of the required date (December 31, 1966), by
                            providing national treatment for the films of other <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries under the screen quota
                            (Article 18 of the draft Italian law) and by using their
                            “option” to make a corresponding increase in the
                            height of the quota. It was noted that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> did not provide a basis for protesting such an action,
                            although the United States had already presented to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission arguments against the
                            desirability of such increases, particularly on a
                            “proportional” basis.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the reported new TV screen quota, and possibly also to the
                            increase in the cinema screen quota, Mr. Thomson noted that Italy had
                            undertaken a standstill commitment with respect to restrictions
                            affecting printed films, in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Code of Liberalization of Current Invisible Operations. The United
                            States, he noted, could argue that both measures were inconsistent with
                            this commitment. However, Mr. Thomson added, there was still no
                            agreement in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> as to whether the
                            standstill covered screen quotas.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In summarizing their views about the bill, the MPEAA representatives made
                            it clear that they were concerned about many of its features, but that
                            they were also highly concerned about safeguarding their
                            companies' high volume of business in Italy and anxious to
                            avoid aggravating the situation unnecessarily.</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>In view of the political history of the bill, and regardless of
                            Italy's international commitments, the MPEAA regarded it as
                            unrealistic to expect to achieve any change in the bill as reported out
                            by the Parliamentary Commission which would be in a more liberal
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>They felt, nevertheless, that it would be desirable at this point for the
                            Ambassador to make a high-level approach on the matter, preferably to
                            Corona, the Minister of Tourism and Entertainment. The main idea they
                            would like to see put across would be on the following lines: the
                            Italians would be jeopardizing future cooperative relations in the film
                            field if they should try to go any further along the path of official
                            discrimination against foreign films. The U.S. film industry could
                            reluctantly learn to live with the provisions of the bill as presently
                            drafted, but the Italians could expect “real
                            trouble” from the American side if they should allow this
                            discrimination to go even a single step further, or if—in
                            areas where the authorities have any discretion—they should
                            implement the law in a restrictive manner. The MPEAA representatives
                            also made it clear that they wanted the U.S. position on the legal
                            issues involved to be put “on the record.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> said he
                            intended to make such a démarche, and that he would consult
                            further with Mr. Hochstetter after they had both returned to Rome. The
                            Ambassador said he had in mind a three-stage presentation:</p>
                        <p>(a) With regard to the legal issues raised by international agreements,
                            he would make sure that the Italians understood that the U.S. Government
                            does not condone Italy's departures from its commitments.</p>
                        <p>(b) He would ask Corona to give him a frank statement of Italian
                            intentions with respect to U.S. film interests. E.g., under what
                            circumstances would the Italians invoke the discretionary measures? Do
                            they still place any value on future cooperative relationships between
                            Italy and the United States in the field of motion pictures? Have they
                            decided to revert to general policy of protectionism in this area?
                            Etc.</p>
                        <p>(c) He would bespeak the cooperation of high Italian officials in
                            preventing matters from getting any worse.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the last part of this proposed démarche,
                            the Ambassador indicated that he would take into consideration the
                            entire scope of our trade and other interests. He said that, if specific
                            trade injury was being felt, he might make use of any figures which the
                            MPEAA could supply him. However, he had found in dealing with certain
                            other trade issues involving Italy that in some cases you simply could
                            not estimate accurately the extent of such injury. Mr. Fineshriber said
                            that the MPEAA might respond to a previous suggestion from Mr. Thomson
                            that it make a rough estimate of the actual effect upon remittances from
                            Italy to the U.S., attributable to (a) the previous 20% rebate, and (b)
                            the proposed more complex rebate. However, he indicated it would not be
                            possible to say anything definite in <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0271"/>this regard, particularly under present favorable
                            market conditions in Italy.</p>
                        <p>Future possibilities were noted for dealing with this matter in
                            international forums, such as the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>,
                            in addition to bilateral representations to the Italian authorities.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> felt that,
                            for the time being, it would be advisable to confine U.S.
                            representations to the bilateral channel and to reserve any U.S. actions
                            in international organizations until such time as circumstances appear
                            to call for them.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> asked the
                            Secretary if any progress had been made in the area of civil aviation.
                            The Secretary said that we are continuing to study the subject, and,
                            that he thought it would be best to continue to handle the matter
                            through the normal channels on the technical level. Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> instantaneously concluded, with
                            the last words of the Secretary, “Yes, with the
                            companies.” The Secretary corrected this and said he referred
                            to government technical channels, then added that if some answer can be
                            found to the problem of capacity there would be hope of solving some of
                            the other aspects of the question.</p>

                                    June 11:</p>
                                <p>“The basic political problem to which the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 program is addressed is that
                                    Italy's four-party, center-left coalition Government,
                                    which was formed in December 1963, is faced with a profusion of
                                    problems which makes it a fragile working partnership. The
                                    Italian Communist Party has skillfully exploited the
                                    Government's vulnerabilities and has steadily
                                    increased its electoral appeal during this period when the vote
                                    of the two major coalition partners, the Christian Democrats
                                    (CD) and the Socialists (<gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>),
                                    has declined. A basic premise of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 program is that if the strength and unity
                                    of the Government coalition can be increased, thus permitting
                                    implementation of its program of basic social, economic and
                                    administrative reforms, the democratic parties'
                                    appeal in the next national election should increase and that of
                                    the Communist Party should decline.” (National

                        <p>The Italian proposal was generally viewed as a “necessary
                            evil” and approved with the following proviso: Mr. Bundy,
                            deploring the chronic failure of the Italian democratic political
                            parties to utilize their own bootstraps, used the term
                            “annual shame” and stated that he felt obliged to
                            advise higher authority of this continuing subsidy. Until such time as
                            the attitude of higher authority is known, final approval remains
                            pending.</p>

                        <p>In welcoming Professor Valletta, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he understood the Professor had been traveling
                            recently, and he would enjoy receiving his impressions. Professor
                            Valletta noted two impressions which had emerged from his discussions
                            with Chairman of Council of Ministers <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in Moscow: First, that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> desired to reduce his defense
                            costs and, with the resulting savings, to shift from the production of
                            armaments and nuclear weapons to more intensive development of consumer
                            goods. Secondly, that with respect to Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had indicated he generally
                            desired a solution but he could not act because he was faced with
                            “independent nations” against which it was
                            difficult to bring pressure; Professor Valletta, who said he had
                            initially raised the Vietnam issue with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, observed that he understood this to be a
                            reference to Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            exercises no effective control over the Hanoi regime's
                            actions. Hanoi, in turn, was under pressure from Peiping to achieve
                            military results. This created difficulties for Moscow and also for us
                            in that we had no one with whom to discuss a peaceful solution. The
                            Secretary continued that the Vietnamese issue had become a formidable
                            barrier in US-Soviet relations. Until that problem was solved there
                            would continue to be considerable strain in US-Soviet relations. These
                            remarks, he added, reflected also the recent <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> discussions,<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v03#d59">

                            Vietnam to those expressed by Professor Valletta.</p>
                        <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>Professor Valletta said that in his modest opinion if some form of
                            US-Soviet contact could be continued as a result of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> talks, this would be all to
                            the good. He guessed that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            would like to intervene usefully in the Vietnamese situation. Indeed,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had accepted the
                            reconvening this month of the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Conference at
                            Geneva. The Secretary interjected that it would be interesting to see
                            what emerged from the current meeting of Communist party leaders in
                            Bucharest, where the Soviet and Chinese leaders would be in
                                contact.<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">July 19-24.</note> The
                            Professor noted that, in any event, it would be well for the United
                            States to continue to retain a position of strength. Agreeing, the
                            Secretary said that if Moscow and Peiping were to come together on the
                            basis of the Soviet thesis of “co-existence” that
                            would be all right, but if, on the other hand, they agreed on
                            Peiping's terms, that would involve very grave dangers not
                            only for the United States but for Europe as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cox said he assumed the informal contacts between Valletta and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would continue in
                            view of the agreement in principle for Fiat to provide technical
                            guidance in automobile production to the Soviet Union. Professor
                            Valletta observed that it was during the discussion of this that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had expressed the
                            desire to better satisfy the Soviet people's needs for a
                            better life. The Secretary noted we always emphasized to the Russians
                            our mutual “unfinished business” in building our
                            own societies. For example, in the United States we required about a
                            million new classrooms, and that we could accordingly think of better
                            ways to spend $50 billion each year than for defense.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Soviet-Fiat agreement in principle to cooperate in
                            automobile production,<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">On May 4 Fiat and the
                                Soviet Government announced agreement for joint planning and
                                construction of an automobile factory in Togliattigrad. The
                                agreement was signed on August 15.</note> Mr. Roosevelt said that
                            Professor Valletta had discussed this with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RVAWFJ1">Raborn</persName> at the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, with Secretary Connor at Commerce, and
                            Deputy Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">No record of these
                                conversations has been found.</note> The Professor had made clear to
                            them that if Fiat's undertaking with the Soviet Union to
                            construct an automobile factory was not in accord with United States
                            policy, he would disengage Fiat. Mr. Roosevelt felt that Professor
                            Valletta would wish to make the same point to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. Professor Valletta said this was
                            correct, but he wished to point out that enhancing Soviet automobile
                            production involved important long-range considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Professor Valletta for his impression of the
                            time-table for cooperation between Fiat and the Soviets. The Professor
                                <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0275"/>replied that the Moscow
                            talks had only touched on general aspects of the problem, and that he
                            anticipated the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would send a
                            mission to Italy to work out more precise details. In essence, Fiat
                            would assist in the construction of a new Soviet automobile plant which
                            would produce from 1000 to 2000 cars per day of the American compact
                            type. In addition, Fiat would help the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to modernize existing plants which now turn out about
                            200,000 cars per year. The Secretary asked whether Fiat would be able to
                            carry out this program itself, or would expect some kind of American
                            participation. Professor Valletta replied that he had told the Soviet
                            officials that if they desired an up-to-date automobile plant, some
                            machinery would be required from the United States. The Secretary then
                            noted that in the broadest sense we were sympathetic toward making more
                            consumer goods available to the Soviet people. Indeed, we were exploring
                            legislation to permit American business to participate more actively in
                            trade with Eastern Europe. However, he wished to add a note of caution
                            concerning possible US participation in Fiat's undertaking
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He would wish to convey
                            something more precise on this particular point and would be in touch
                            with Professor Valletta after consulting with his colleagues, especially
                            Secretary Connor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cox observed that Secretary Connor had made the same point. Indeed,
                            an officer from Commerce's office of export controls had been
                            present and had indicated that he foresaw no problems. The Soviets would
                            apparently require three to five-year credits, however. The Secretary
                            asked how the Soviets would pay, by increased oil exports to Italy?
                            Professor Valletta noted that the present balance of trade between Italy
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> favored the latter. If the
                            automobile project went forward, credit terms would have to be arranged.
                            In setting up a modern automobile industry, the Soviet Union would not
                            only have to utilize their technical resources but would also have to
                            import machinery, perhaps from France, Britain, and Germany, among
                            others.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the discussion, the Secretary reiterated that we would wish
                            to give this project some thought and would convey our reaction shortly.
                            He added jokingly that perhaps it would help if we could obtain Soviet
                            machinery to destroy old and discarded American automobiles. Laughingly
                            agreeing, Professor Valletta expressed appreciation for his having had
                            the opportunity to discuss his visit to Russia with the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> has delivered
                            to me your message of July 26th.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">Not

                                visited Rome July 24-25, during a July 8-August 3 trip to Europe.
                                The Embassy reported on his talk with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> in telegram 229 from Rome, July 26. (Library of

                        </p>
                        <p>I wish to thank you warmly for your thoughtfulness in briefing me on the
                            South Vietnam situation through Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>: I have much appreciated the fact that you have
                            chosen to add your personal remarks to those of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The conversation I had here has been very useful to me to improve my
                            knowledge of the issue in the light of new elements. They confirm the
                            reasons for the understanding we have repeatedly expressed for the
                            motivations of the United States's action in Viet Nam. Such
                            action is all the more valuable in as much as it is coupled with offers
                            for a peaceful and honorable solution, constantly and even recently
                            reiterated, and with generous plans aimed at fostering, in the framework
                            of a re-established peace, the welfare of the peoples of South East Asia
                            through economic and social development.</p>
                        <p>I also share your viewpoint on the advisability of a solidarity,
                            demonstrated also with facts, to an action which encourages the free
                            world to believe in the keeping of one's word and in the
                            failure of violence exerted for the purpose of upsetting freely accepted
                            juridical situations.</p>
                        <p>I have therefore confirmed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> the decision to renew the medical assistance,
                            and I wish to inform you that I have given instructions to examine the
                            possibility of increasing our humanitarian assistance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was accompanied by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>, whom I
                            shall contact for any further consultation, as you kindly suggested.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Some weeks ago you asked me to review this problem and bring you up to
                            date on it more specifically. I have now done so, and the situation is
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>Over the years the US has assisted the democratic Italian political
                            parties and trade unions at a very high rate. Over the period 1955-1965,
                            the total amount of assistance is just under [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. In recent years
                            we have been cutting this assistance back, primarily because the
                            professionals closely related to the operation have concluded that we
                            have not been getting our full money's worth and what the
                            Italian political parties need is not so much U.S. money as energetic
                            administrative leadership. President Kennedy had a personal feeling that
                            political subsidies at this level were excessive, and they were scaled
                            down.</p>
                        <p>In the last two or three years, assistance has been running at a rate of
                            about [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>], except in the election year of 1963. The
                            recommendation for next year runs to a total of [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. The
                            interdepartmental review committee for covert
                            operations—Vance, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RVAWFJ1">Raborn</persName> and myself—has approved this
                            recommendation subject to your concurrence.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, by separate and somewhat unusual channels, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] have let us
                            know that they would like a lot more money. They have given no practical
                            justification, and indeed have been at pains to suggest that our
                            orthodox channels are stuffy and uncooperative. I have had a long
                            interview with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] man most familiar with this subject (he was
                            in Rome for 8 years), and he persuades me that this end run is as
                            unjustified in fact as it appears to be on the surface. Having begun
                            with a sympathetic view that money might beat the Communists, I have
                            been entirely converted by his detailed account of the efforts we have
                            made to get the Italian parties to do better with the money we have
                            already given them.</p>
                        <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>In this situation, I believe that we should approve the recommended
                            budget for this year and go back to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] by appropriate quiet channels
                            to say that we cannot do more unless and until there is evidence that
                            additional money is what is really needed, and that such money can be
                            used really effectively. This would put the responsibility with them,
                            where it belongs, while leaving us free to do more if and when a really
                            good opportunity presents itself. It remains true that the
                            anti-Communist battle in Italy is one of politics and resources; but
                            simple hand-outs and intelligently applied resources are two entirely

                        <p>The Secretary remarked that we have been in frequent contact with the
                            other side about Vietnam but there had been no indication of interest in
                            negotiations. We believe that, while Moscow would like to see the matter
                            come to the conference table, Peiping is 1,000 percent opposed. Hanoi is
                            somewhere in between, but unwilling to act independently.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> advised the Secretary that
                            the Italians had recently received reports that Hanoi was somewhat more
                            disposed to negotiate, possibly without the expressed approval of
                            Peiping. The Italians had gathered that Hanoi was troubled by the degree
                            of their subordination to Peiping. As an example, a new Foreign
                            Minister, believed to be a close friend of the Chinese Communists, has
                            been appointed in Hanoi. Although this move might be a concession to
                            Peiping, it might work also out the other way around. It is just
                            possible that Ho Chi Minh might be trying to put this man in a difficult
                            position and thereby achieve somewhat more autonomy for North Vietnam.
                            Certainly some observers have commented that the North Vietnamese might
                            now be much less adamant on negotiations than before.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked in this connection, that he would be interested to
                            know if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would even be
                            willing to discuss such negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would
                            not even discuss the subject with him in Vienna.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> explained that the
                            information to which he had referred was from Hanoi rather than from
                            Moscow. Before leaving Rome he had requested that the information and
                            sources be checked out. He said that he mentioned it only as one slight
                            indication of the desire of Hanoi for more autonomy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the North Vietnamese should be very careful on
                            this point. If the fighting goes on, regardless of what transpires
                            between China and the United States, North Vietnam will be
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> wondered whether the
                            present slowing down of military operations in Vietnam might be the only
                            way open to the North Vietnamese to indicate their desire for
                            conciliation without the approval of Peiping.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this may come, but that we have not ourselves
                            noticed any such indication. The Secretary expressed interest in any
                            information which the Italians might develop along this line.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> admitted that the Italians
                            have no direct contact with the North Vietnamese. He said they are
                            keeping their eyes and ears open and that they would pass along to the
                            United States any information which they could obtain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> that
                            President Johnson had recently issued two very important instructions:
                            1) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was to
                            take all steps necessary to insure that the other side would experience
                            no military success in South Vietnam between now and January, 2)
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was to take any
                            political steps necessary to reach a peaceful settlement between now and
                            January.</p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0280"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he interprets this to mean the following: When
                            Congress convenes in January, we shall be at the end of a small war.
                            Either we shall have peace or we shall have to do a great deal more than
                            we are doing now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> remarked that the period
                            from now until December is considered decisive even by Hanoi. This may
                            be because of the events in Hanoi which have already been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said that he would like to
                            inquire, with the utmost tact and with no intention of compromising the
                            United States, or Italy, whether he could pursue further any reports of
                            an inclination on the part of Hanoi to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would give <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> the text of a recent statement which he had made
                            on television.<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s September 7

                                512-514.</note> A statement which was aimed at Hanoi. In this
                            statement he had attempted to deal with the issues raised by Hanoi under
                            the Four Points.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">Reference is to the North
                                Vietnamese Four-Point formula presented April 8.</note> The
                            Secretary pointed out that there had been numerous contacts with Hanoi
                            but that it is impossible to know through which channel they will
                            ultimately respond. The Secretary felt that this statement would give
                            Fanfani a clear indication of our attitude on negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> assured the Secretary that
                            until the present the Italians have hesitated to take any step which
                            might weaken the position of the United States. The worst mistake which
                            could be made, in his opinion, would be to give the impression of
                            negotiating from an appearance of weakness. He believed this was
                            especially true during the monsoon season.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this was not so important now. With all our
                            troops and firepower in the field, we are not so worried.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> replied that since we could
                            now negotiate from a position of strength it affords us a better
                            opportunity to see what can be done through diplomacy. He wished to make
                            clear, however, that: 1) the Italians don't wish to
                            compromise the United States or themselves in any way; 2) they will
                            pursue their inquiries on a discreet basis and only in an exploratory
                            way; and 3) they don't wish to participate in negotiations,
                            but only to act as a friend and an ally.<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">[<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] (Johnson

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the big question is whether Hanoi is prepared to
                            come to the conference table without the consent of Peiping. Will Hanoi
                            have the courage to come to the conference table with <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0281"/>Chinese troops on the ground? If they
                            have, the Secretary stated that he would be willing to leave for Geneva
                            tomorrow to meet with them.</p>

                                text not declassified</hi>] briefed me this morning (Oct 14) on
                            reports of alleged US intervention in consideration of Generals Vedovato
                            and <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> to succeed
                            General Aloia as Chief of Staff Italian Army. These reports fitted in
                            with recent private conversation with Malfatti who had told me it was
                            being said US opposed <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                            Lorenzo</persName>. Malfatti said <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName> was Saragat's candidate and anything
                            we could do to refute reports of American opposition would be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>I have been to see Cottafavi in <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s office later this morning on other
                            matters and have taken occasion to make clear to him for private
                            information of PriMin that US is not intervening or taking sides in this
                            internal Italian matter and that we have an equally high regard for all
                            possible candidates.</p>
                        <p>Cottafavi said matter would probably not be decided much before the end
                            of the year although earlier decision had at one point appeared likely.

                        <p>1691. 1. Highly reliable source has given me following information about
                            recent visit paid to Hanoi by Mayor of Florence, La Pira, with request
                            that it be treated with great discretion. La Pira had given it to source
                            when he stopped off in Moscow last week en route home from four or five
                            day visit in Hanoi, where he had gone to promote North Vietnamese
                            attendance at a conference hopefully to be held in Florence to which
                            representatives of all faiths and ideologies will be invited.</p>
                        <p>2. During his visit, La Pira saw Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong and other
                                <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> leaders, and got impression that
                            there had been distinct evolution in their attitudes toward the war. La
                            Pira believes <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> leaders are now
                            willing to stop all fighting if bombing of North Vietnam were to cease,
                            giving rise to de facto cease-fire with all soldiers remaining in place
                            a la Kashmir.</p>
                        <p>3. Re inter-faith conference, La Pira said North Vietnam had agreed to
                            send representatives to conference and they would be willing to sit down
                            with anyone there, including U.S. representatives.</p>
                        <p>4. Source described La Pira as a humanitarian and democrat. While not
                            questioning sincerity of his belief about <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> readiness for cease-fire, he pointed out that he was
                            not diplomat or trained reporter and consequently did not know how much
                            weight to give his report which, I gather, will be conveyed directly to
                            Italian FonMin by La Pira on his return.</p>

                            reports from Hanoi. It is now clear that the conversations there were
                            held by the Mayor of Florence, La Pira, a rather fuzzy-minded
                            non-Communist leftist who has been critical of our position in Vietnam.
                            Moreover, it is quite clear that Ho Chi Minh managed to fold in his
                            unacceptable conditions, while giving an appearance of interest in
                            peaceful negotiations. This is not at all a real feeler for
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said the United States will be faced with a major political
                            problem in the first months of 1966. The Administration will be going to
                            the Congress with important proposals regarding Viet-Nam which will have
                            major significance with regard to manpower and finances. He pointed out
                            the recent Soviet announcement of an increase of the U.S.S.R. military
                            budget. The United States will announce an increase in its military
                            budget. The Administration proposals will place major demands on the
                            American people.</p>
                        <p>Against the loss of lives and the expenditures to date by the United
                            States in defense of the Free World, the American people will ask what
                            other members of the Free World are doing. The American public will ask,
                            for example, how many U.S. soldiers are in West Germany? The answer is
                            230,000. They will then ask how many West Germans are in Viet-Nam? The
                            answer is 50. Questions will be asked about Free World shipping to
                            Haiphong and West Germans building a steel mill in China, among others.
                            All of these questions will be very delicate for us in the next few
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we do not know whether or not we will be at general
                            war in the Pacific in the next few months. This depends on Peiping and
                            Hanoi. We have two choices: we can quit or we can meet them. We will
                            meet them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that he had said to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that the United States cannot abandon its commitment
                            in the Pacific and honor its commitment in the Atlantic. This is not
                            possible morally, legally or psychologically. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, therefore, has a fundamental stake in what happens in
                            Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> pointed out
                            that the internal problem in Italy is made more difficult because other
                            Atlantic allies do not do what the United States wants. The Italian
                            opposition says you cannot tell us what to do. Other friends of the
                            United States won't do what the United States wants. The
                            Ambassador said that he was offering this not as a justification but as
                            an explanation of Italian difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that it is the integrity of the United States
                            that is a matter of national interest for each country.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said that what the
                            Secretary had said did not surprise him at all. He had long seen that we
                            would some day reach this point. He had a profound conviction that
                            verbal solidarity is much more difficult to apply in days of difficulty.
                            He had always said it was necessary to be careful lest the consensus in
                            a crisis be less than in days of prosperity. He had always said let us
                            be careful of France lest the example of French dissension weaken the
                            solidarity in other countries. In Italy, there is an important segment
                            of opinion which is not confined only to the Italian Socialist Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>) but also extends to the
                            Democratic Socialists (<gloss target="#t_PSDI1">PSDI</gloss>) which
                            takes the position that Italy should not show more solidarity with the
                            United States than does the United Kingdom Labor Party. Policy toward
                            China is an example. It is not easy for the Italian Government, which
                            must take into account the resources and reactions of other countries
                            and not only those of the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> pointed out that Italian
                            policies in Latin America had been aimed at maintaining the greatest
                            possible support for the United States, which is Italy's
                            greatest ally. Italy does not seek thanks for this activity but
                            considers it a matter of its own national interest to support the United
                            States in this area—to fend off the mosquitoes around the
                            legs of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was not being critical but some of the problems
                            have been falsely stated. The proposition is usually put
                            “shall we support the United States?”. In fact,
                            the matter should be looked at in the light of the national interest of
                            each country. The proposition should be stated “is it to
                            Italy's interest that Hanoi succeed in
                            aggression?” The Secretary said he would not fear the results
                            of a careful and dispassionate Italian examination of this proposal. He
                            was sure our interests would come out the same.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> rejoined that as he had
                            said, Italy's Latin American policy is not altruistic. It is
                            in Italy's interest to support the United States. It is a
                            favor Italy does itself.</p>
                        <p>The fact exists, however, that while being a faithful ally of the United
                            States, Italy cherishes the liberty to disagree. The United States
                            should not overlook a repetitive historical cycle which happens to the
                            most powerful country. At this point in history, it is the turn of the
                            United States. The rest of the world contains those, even your friends,
                            who want to retain <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0286"/>the freedom
                            to disagree with you. Even now the Italian Government may be considered
                            as selling itself to the United States by a large segment of its own
                            public opinion. It can be accused of being too conservative. The trend
                            in the world is to change, not to conserve. It is possible that in two
                            or three months the United States may find itself in the position of
                            bearing great burdens and of not having the full support of its friends
                            and allies. This is a tragedy but it is also a fact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that to the U.S. the defense of liberty is
                            indivisible. America has some forty allies around the world, and they
                            should be aware of this. If you scratch an American you find an
                            isolationist under the surface. If the American people are once
                            disappointed in the support of their allies, you will find an
                            isolationist United States. This is a fact. The President does not want
                            this to happen but it will happen. Is this in the interest of Italy or
                            that of our allies? This is as much a problem for you as it is for
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had told <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            that our friends never worry about the morale of the American people.
                            They should be aware that anyone who relies on the United States has a
                            political constituency in the United States that needs attention just as
                            much as a constituency at home.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said that what the
                            Secretary had told him confirms his own thoughts that it could be a big
                            temptation for the United States to want to stay at home. This does not
                            shock him. Many people, in spite of the power of the United States,
                            wonder whether the Communist danger may not be too much even for the
                            United States alone. The United States did not seek this responsibility.
                            History bids the United States to carry the load in the interest of all.
                            The problem is to come out successfully, not just to depend on your own
                            resources and resourcefulness.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said it would give him the
                            greatest of pleasure to join a chorus praising the United States and
                            urging it on. There is one caveat, however. He would like to point out
                            to the Secretary that it is very important to have not only good words
                            but good acts from other countries. To obtain this the United States
                            needs not only the solidarity of other Governments but also the
                            solidarity of other peoples. Based on this solidarity of the people of
                            other nations, the United States has twice been successful in world
                            conflicts in this century. He would say to the Secretary, however, that
                            before undertaking great acts, the United States should be sure that in
                            fact it has this solidarity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked how it would be
                            possible to obtain the support of the people of Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he had been away from
                            Italy for three months but he has kept in touch and has read telegrams.
                            He felt he had made some small contribution to the United States by
                            winning the battle of the United States bases in the Pacific in the
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0287"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he had been
                            tremendously impressed by public and press attitudes in Italy regarding
                            Viet-Nam. Nenni has abstained but how about his party? <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said as the Secretary knows he
                            has always tried to split the Socialists from the Communists but the
                            Viet-Nam problem is working against this trend.</p>
                        <p>The United States should imagine itself in a situation where it might
                            take an extreme decision regarding Viet-Nam which might cause the
                            Italian Government to fall and precipitate a Government crisis in Italy.
                            The United States would be faced not only with its extreme burden in the
                            Pacific but also with confusion in the Mediterranean area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he had a serious thing
                            to say. It was his duty to say it. The Secretary spoke of the danger of
                            isolationism in the United States. He felt it his duty to tell the
                            Secretary that the majority of the members of the United Nations, no
                            matter what their color, will not support the United States. This is a
                            statement which applies in general and not only to Viet-Nam. Look at the
                            voting record. Many of the votes are on an equivocal basis. Look at the
                            scanty majorities. The Secretary could have no idea of the cost at which
                            these scanty majorities had been garnered nor of the effort required on
                            the part of the U.S. Delegation. How many times have we had to say
                            “let's hold off a vote for a few days.”
                            The Secretary could have no idea how displeased <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> was to be obliged to tell him
                            this. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said it should be
                            remembered that he is of a naturally optimistic nature. The United
                            States has need of the most sensitive thermometers to understand better
                            the climate in which it is operating.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said that he was grateful
                            that the Secretary told him that in the next few months the United
                            States will have rough weather. It is true that there are forces at home
                            which the United States must watch. There are also forces abroad which
                            must be watched. The United States should look not only at Governments
                            but at peoples. Otherwise, it will lose battles to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that for each nation it is a question of priorities.
                            Each should begin where it is and work from there. Looking at our
                            Western European friends it seemed to the Secretary that their first
                            problem is the prosperity of Western Europe and he was thinking of the
                            Common Market in this connection. The second interest of Western Europe
                            is the soundness of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Here, the
                            Secretary said, he would like to pay tribute to Italy's
                            contribution to both of these interests.</p>
                        <p>Another priority for Western Europe, the Secretary continued, is
                            relations between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw
                            Pact countries. We regard ourselves only as partners. We believe we
                            should work as a group and, through a process of full cooperation, we
                            should move together.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that speaking personally, since some of his colleagues
                            do not agree, he believes Western Europe should place a high <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0288"/>priority on developments in Africa.
                            This is a vast continent, ten minutes flying time from the small
                            peninsula of land called Europe. Events in Africa should have a high
                            priority for Europe.</p>
                        <p>Beyond that, there are the problems that arise in the Pacific area and
                            Asia. The Secretary said he could understand why Western European
                            countries so distant from the Pacific and Asia wish that the problems
                            there could simply go away and disappear. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> interrupted to say that Europeans do not
                            consider these problems distant, far away, or abstract. It is only
                            Governments that do not want problems with their own public opinion that
                            say these matters are abstract or distant.</p>
                        <p>Two elements force these problems on European countries, said the
                            Secretary. One, the Communists are active all over the world. It is a
                            question of whether militant aggression or peaceful coexistence is to be
                            successful. The second element he had already discussed. This was the
                            attitude of the United States toward its commitments to other nations.
                            The Secretary said he understood that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries have problems arising out of domestic
                            difficulties. Canada, the United Kingdom and Norway are governed by thin
                            majorities. Denmark is facing new elections. The Netherlands has a
                            minority Government. Belgium has a fragile political situation. France
                            has a 75 year old leader. Italy has a not always easy coalition
                            Government. Greece has been without a government for some time. In fact,
                            only Luxembourg is stable. We understand these problems but they cause
                            problems for us. The representative of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Government came recently to the Secretary and said,
                            “if the United States does not do thus and so, my Government
                            will fall.” To whom can the United States say this sort of
                            thing?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he much appreciated
                            this score card. The United States must understand the absolute
                            necessity, however, for it to have friendly peoples as well as friendly
                            governments in order to obtain support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said things are not going
                            well in the Communist world. The Secretary responded that it is a great
                            tragedy that at this time we also present a picture of disarray in the
                            Free World. It is the great tragedy of this period in history that while
                            the Communist world is in disorder, we also are in disarray and unable
                            to present a contrast of unity which would make it possible to take a
                            great step forward.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said there are two
                            problems: one is the lack of unity in the West. The second is that we
                            have no Communist dictators to deal with. The Communist world is divided
                            and redivided among themselves. We cannot go to a dictator and say:
                            “which is it, peace or war?” It takes two to talk.
                            Four are too many.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there is the same problem with regard to Viet-Nam.
                            There are differences between Hanoi and Peiping but who can we deal
                            with? Looking at each section of the world it seemed to the <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0289"/>Secretary that general trends are
                            favorable if we can just solve the Viet-Nam problem. We should keep in
                            mind that Communists are not ten feet tall. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said this was lucky in view of his own short
                            stature.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> said he had
                            seen Nenni in Rome. Nenni was impressed by the fact that any Chinese
                            Communist triumph would have an effect on the Soviets and would bring
                            back the hard line.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to a conversation he had had with the Deputy
                            Foreign Minister of Poland who had said the number one problem is to
                            turn the Chinese Communists toward peaceful coexistence. The Secretary
                            said he agreed with the observation of the Deputy Foreign Minister, but
                            that if he had made the statement it would be called capitalistic
                            propaganda. If we cannot turn the Chinese Communists from the hard line
                            and this line is successful, the hard line will triumph everywhere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said the United States must
                            preserve the success of the policies it has been following for the last
                            twenty years.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> called on me
                            today to ask our views on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            crisis before he returned to Rome.</p>
                        <p>I marched him through the essential elements of the
                            President's Polish-American speech.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Reference is to Johnson's May 3
                                statement commemorating Poland's millennium of
                                Christianity and national identity. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>,
                                Book I, pp. 475-478.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>He then raised the following matters:</p>
                        <p>1. Speaking as a partisan of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the United States and a partisan of moderate political forces in Italy,
                            he urged very strongly that we not slide into a tripartite directorate
                            of U.S., <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Bonn. Leaving Italy out
                            is dangerous to our common interests. It strengthens both the extreme
                            right in Italy and the extreme left, undercutting the bases for moderate
                            politics. We must never forget that Italy is there and should be treated
                            as a senior partner along with Britain and Germany.</p>
                        <p>2. His second point was that if and when the U.S. changes course on a
                            major issue, it is extremely important that the Italian Government <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0290"/>be informed in advance. When a
                            change is made (for example the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>) the
                            best friends of the United States are left out on a limb, having fought
                            a tough political battle at home.</p>
                        <p>He cited as another example a possible change on China policy.</p>
                        <p>He then zeroed in on newspaper stories that the President was taking a
                            different position than the State Department in dealing with DeGaulle.
                            He wanted to know if the President was softer on DeGaulle than the State
                            Department and possibly interested in going the route of Senator Church
                            and Senator Fulbright.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the President was deeply and personally engaged in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problems; we are a united Government
                            under a strong President; and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and the Department of State were the authentic
                            voices of the President's policies.</p>
                        <p>He remarked wistfully that it is impossible in Italy to be left of <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>; for example, on Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. He ended by stating his appreciation for the Polish-American speech
                            which he felt was a lucid and constructive framework for dealing with
                            East-West relations.</p>

                            cautious. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he had told
                            Khrushchev in 1961 that Soviet Union should appreciate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s role

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, when same point made to him, had not replied.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> thought Sov initiative
                            on European Security Conference stemmed from concern over effects of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis on Germany's
                            place in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary summarized U.S. public attitude toward <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis, emphasizing that while public and Congress
                            prepared support U.S. sharing of all burdens on Fourteen arising from
                            position of France, major political problem would arise if Fourteen
                            themselves fell into confusion or paralysis. This would generate
                            disillusion with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and would arouse
                            concern lest it cause miscalculation in Moscow. This unity of Fourteen
                            at Brussels meeting highly important to future U.S. support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said Italian contacts with
                            others of Fourteen showed little divergencies of attitude among them.
                            Italian public opinion not worried. In recent appearances before
                            committees of Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate, <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> had found larger majority
                            supporting Italian sharing in material burdens arising from
                                France-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis than usually
                            supported government on other issues. As examples, he said no members of
                            committees had objected when informed Italy prepared accept <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense College in Rome if asked. As
                            second example, he said that at Cabinet meeting just before his
                            departure for Brussels, he had estimated possible cost to Italy of
                                France-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> problems at 60 billion
                            lire. This had aroused no serious opposition. His statement that Vicenza
                            depots might have to be enlarged evoked no protest. Only difficulty was
                            minor: some had opposed choice of Rome as site when sections of NAMSA
                            moved to Italy.</p>
                        <p>As by-product of France-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said Italian Socialist
                            Party now aware of positive benefits of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> integration. Socialists had problem of presenting
                            their acceptance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to public
                            opinion. They would take approach of emphasizing that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> political as well as military reform
                            could now be studied. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName>
                            thought stress on role of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in
                            East-West dialogue would be helpful to Socialists.</p>
                        <p>On political right, within Christian-Democratic, Social-Democratic and
                            Liberal Parties, <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said
                            there was preoccupation with strategic isolation of Italy as result
                                France-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> crisis. These elements
                            felt maximum links with France had to be maintained to facilitate
                            France's future reassociation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> himself thought France had
                            substantial interests binding it to other allies, such as desire
                            maintain troops in Germany and general question of relations with
                            neighbors. This meant that negotiations, though difficult, might be
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>Replying, Secretary said U.S. also concerned with geographic effect of
                            French actions on Italy. He expressed hope France-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> agreement on use of air space could
                            be reached and pointed out use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            country air space by France was vital for French atomic force.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> doubted <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s present policy
                            was designed to produce complete break with Alliance. He saw large
                            tactical elements in French position, as he said had been case in <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> crisis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary suggested <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> and
                            Schroeder might find occasion talk with Couve as neighbors, probing why
                            France was taking actions ostensibly so damaging to
                            neighbors' interests.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> felt <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> already had in mind
                            resumption of dialogue with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            partners. He said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had
                            casually remarked to Italian diplomat on June 2 that it was time to
                            terminate <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> affairs “on the side, then
                            resume discussion among Six.” <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said opportunity for talks of kind Secretary had
                            in mind might arise on June 13 when <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            Council would meet to discuss whether to confirm presidency of
                            Hallstein. French were opposed. If they yielded, this could be starting
                            point for wider talks. If they held out, this could provide even better
                            opportunity.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>. He thought that while
                            substantive reasons might be sound, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            handling and timing were poor. <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>
                            itself represented waste of money since members merely rediscovered what
                            U.S. had already learned. It made no sense when <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss> was launching Europe I in Australia simultaneously
                            with U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary expressed concern about <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            decision, which had strongly disappointed U.S. He said he intended
                            discuss it with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName>, who would be calling
                            later in evening. If <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdrawal stood
                            firm, Secretary would want <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName>'s judgment as to what might be done. U.S.
                            felt it important that Western European technology advance, and sought
                            means make U.S. technology available. President Johnson had recently
                            sent Mr. Frutkin to Europe in this connection. Frutkin had found much
                            interest in Germany, almost none in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            with Italy somewhere between.</p>
                        <p>U.S. spent 30 billion dollars on research and development for all
                            purposes, Secretary continued. Although we recognized differences in
                            industrial capacity, and difficulties of starting “Marshall
                            Plan for Technology”, way had to be found.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> welcomed
                            Secretary's statement. He thought Marshall Plan for
                            Technology would show possibilities inherent in Atlantic Community
                            concept. Italians were impressed by almost unbridgeable gap between U.S.
                            and European technology. They favored identifying specific areas for
                            cooperation to integrate U.S. and European efforts. If <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> indeed dropped out of <gloss target="#t_ELDO1">ELDO</gloss>, Italian Cabinet had agreed that
                            Italy would do same, and would devote resources instead to national
                            research. Most of shifted funds would go to send people to U.S. for
                            study. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> thought Marshall
                            Plan for Technology would have great attraction also in France, even if
                            not with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. It would also
                            find receptivity in Eastern Europe and thus promote coexistence.</p>

                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>. Secretary said
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> would decide in June
                            whether to serve as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> SecGen beyond
                            present term. Although President Johnson in letter had urged him stay
                            on, appeared strong possibility he would leave. Secretary foresaw great
                            problems in finding successor in view Soviet veto power. He requested
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> as General Assembly
                            President write <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> urging him
                            to stay on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> said he had touched on
                            subject with <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> in Strasbourg
                            but had learned little. He agreed to send letter now urging SecGen keep
                            post.</p>
                        <p>Secretary thought <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> motivated
                            to leave <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by pressure from Ne Win, by
                            family problems and by behind scenes Soviet pressure to exact
                            concessions actions as price for supporting <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName>'s continuation in office. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> added as motive burden of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> financing question.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> thought family reasons
                            might be overriding; suggested further exploration this motive. He
                            thought former <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Deputy SecGen, Soviet
                            national Milanya, who just ordained as Anglican priest, had spiritual
                            ties with <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName>, and suggested
                            Ralph Bunche could sound Milanya.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> added rumor was circulating
                            that U.S. was opposed to <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U
                            Thant</persName>'s continuation in office while Soviets
                            supported it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary concluded by expressing hope for another talk with <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> before both left Brussels, to
                            discuss Communist China and other matters.</p>
                        <p>As meeting broke up, <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName> handed
                            over aide-mémoire on Italian approach to EximBank concerning
                            45 billion lire purchase of supplies in U.S. for Fiat factories.
                            Secretary observed problem was essentially technical, with no top-level
                            political aspects. Text of aide-mémoire will follow

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommends that we grant
                            an Italian request for a 5-year Ex-Im Bank loan of up to $50 million to
                            finance export of U.S. equipment which would be used in a new Fiat
                            automobile plant in the Soviet Union. This does not require formal
                            Presidential action; the Bank has the authority and the money. The
                            Secretary wants to (1) direct Linder to go ahead and (2) informally
                            notify key people on the Hill.</p>
                        <p>The loan makes good sense in terms of bridge-building and our interest in
                            having the Soviets go in for “middle class”
                            consumer goods. In terms of exports, if Ex-Im turns the Italians down we
                            would probably lose the sale. The terms (5-years) would be standard for
                            an export credit.</p>
                        <p>Tony Solomon tells me that, despite wide publicity, there has been no
                            noise on the Hill about the Fiat deal, and nobody in either House is a
                            sure bet to complain. He thinks—and I agree—that
                            prior soundings would only stir up opposition. If you approve, we would
                            propose to notify the relevant people before Harold Linder makes any
                            public announcement: Senators Mansfield, Long, Dirksen, Kuchel,
                            Fulbright, Magnuson, Robertson, Hickenlooper, Cotton and <persName corresp="#p_BWTJ1">Bennett</persName>; the Speaker, Messrs. Albert,

                        <p>I would vote yes—but you know my prejudice in favor of
                            bridge-building (in terms of foreign policy, and in terms of a balanced
                            Presidential posture against the background of Vietnam).</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I want to elaborate further on our discussion on Tuesday about the
                            Italian covert program.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">No record of this
                                discussion has been found.</note> The coming months may represent a
                            critical period for political stability in Italy. Decisive steps to
                            reunify the Socialist and Social Democratic parties are anticipated this
                            fall. This prospect, in conjunction with the strong rivalries within the
                            Christian Democratic party, could put new strains on <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s center-left coalition.
                            An additional unsettling factor is the approaching general elections.
                            They must take place not later than April 1968.</p>
                        <p>Since my assignment to Rome I have consistently recommended the gradual
                            reduction of covert activities in Italy. The record in fact shows sharp
                            year-to-year cuts in expenditures. The level of funds has dropped from
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 to a
                            recommended [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. The
                            latter figure represents a cut of 35% from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966. It is also significant that in recent years we
                            have progressively discontinued direct subsidies to political
                            parties—the last was the small program in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>]. All other support to
                            political parties has been contingent on approved action programs in
                            support of U.S. policy objectives, in the absence of which no funds have
                            been made available. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] is now on notice that any support for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 would be on such a basis.
                            Accordingly the proposed program contains no unstructured contributions
                            to any political party's finances.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances, I recommend that the program proposed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 be approved. An abrupt
                            discontinuance of the program at this time would be interpreted by some
                            of our friends, on whom we must depend for achievement of our policy
                            objectives in Italy, as a change in our long-standing support for them
                            and for what they are attempting to achieve. I am particularly concerned
                            that we avoid any action which might disturb the <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>

                            which seems to offer the best chance of strengthening political
                            stability and democracy in <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0296"/>Italy. At the same time, I feel that we should continue the gradual

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>You should know that <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Sergio
                                Fenoaltea</persName> came in to make the strongest and most
                            emotional representations that I have received from a diplomat in a long
                            time.</p>
                        <p>His theme was that if, in addition to the tripartite talks, we were to
                            accept a formula for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear
                            committee which did not grant Italy permanent status, the whole relation
                            of Italy to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and, indeed, the
                            stability of Italian domestic politics would be endangered.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that Italian support for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> hinged on its being treated as an equal to the other
                            three European countries of similar size: Britain, France, and Germany.
                            If we built into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> any arrangement
                            which put the Italians alongside, say, Belgium or The Netherlands, the
                            Italians, a proud people, would go into a violent emotional
                            reaction—whether neutralist or Fascist, no one could say. He
                            had heard that we had given Harlan Cleveland instructions, as a fallback
                            position, to shift in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear
                            committee from 4 permanent and 2 rotating members to a 3-3 formula. In
                            the end, this could only mean that Italy would be odd-man-out.</p>
                        <p>Basically, <persName corresp="#p_FS1">Fenoaltea</persName> is correct in
                            his judgment of the danger here.</p>
                        <p>We got with State and received assurances:</p>
                        <p>—that they would stick with the 4-2 formula; and</p>
                        <p>—that there would be no change without the issue coming to
                            your personal attention.</p>

                        <p>At a small dinner on March 15 I had an opportunity to talk at some length
                            with General <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName>, whom I
                            have met a number of times before. The following were his main comments
                            on Italian internal and foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Affairs</p>
                        <p>The General was outspokenly critical of the Italian Socialist Party and
                            of the Minister of Defense, Tremelloni. He was less directly critical of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, perhaps out of
                            respect for the President's high office, but it was obvious
                            that he was also not very happy about the President's
                            attitude towards the Italian Army.</p>
                        <p>(It should be recalled that the General, who has a strong personality and
                            has played a leading role in organizing such key anti-subversive
                            elements in Italy's armed forces as the Carabinieri and the
                                <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0298"/>Armed Forces Intelligence
                            Service (formerly called <gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>, now
                            SID) has a Monarchist background and, while not politically active in
                            recent years, supported the Monarchy as an institution in 1945/46, and
                            in early Fascist years. This undoubtedly profoundly affects his attitude
                            towards Socialists, including the present Socialist President of the
                            Republic. But the main burden of his remarks were directed at an alleged
                            lack of understanding of the Army and its problems by Tremelloni, in
                            particular, and the allegedly poor effects of Tremelloni's
                            leadership at the Ministry of Defense upon the morale of the Armed
                            Forces. This view is apparently widely shared in the Armed Forces.)</p>
                        <p>The General said that Tremelloni, having no experience in such matters,
                            simply does not understand the job of running the Defense Ministry.
                            Tremelloni approaches it primarily as an economist. His emphasis is
                            constantly upon reducing expenses, without due regard for morale and
                            quality. For example, army salaries are not high enough, and nothing is
                            being done about raising them. As a consequence the quality of younger
                            officers is rapidly going down. The ablest no longer desire to make the
                            Army their permanent career. (Throughout the conversation the General
                            referred specifically only to the Army, but by implication he was also
                            thinking of the Air Force and Navy.) To add to the feeling of
                            frustration in the forces, while Tremelloni turned a deaf ear to
                            complaints about inappropriate economies in the Armed Forces, the
                            government continued to increase the expenditures and allotments of many
                            other Ministries.</p>
                        <p>The General said that while <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>
                            takes some direct interest in the Armed Forces, his interest is limited
                            to “special areas” (undefined) and not in the
                            Armed Forces as a whole. The General did not elaborate upon this, but
                            perhaps was referring here to the recent controversy over personal files
                            allegedly missing from SID archives. As <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName> formerly headed this organization, he has been
                            involved in the controversy.<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">An internal
                                probe of this issue, launched by Tremelloni, had become public, and
                                on February 18 the Procurator General of Rome began a judicial
                                inquiry. Subsequently, the Italian Parliament took up an
                                investigation. In April the <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> government relieved <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> of command.</note> His
                            only direct reference to this matter with me, however, was to say that
                            this was a tempest in a teapot. In any case this led him to draw an
                            invidious comparison between President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> and former President <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>, he
                            said, took a much broader and more genuine anterest in the Armed Forces.
                            (This led to a brief discussion of <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName>'s health which the General said was
                            still stationary. Since his stroke, which resulted in his resignation
                            from the Presidency, <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> has
                            been living very quietly near Rome. He is still unable to talk and moves
                            about very little because of his partial paralysis.)</p>
                        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>My net impression of the General's remarks was that he has
                            reached the point of having little patience not only with Saragat and
                            Tremelloni but with the Italian Government as a whole. I referred once
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s unusually
                            long tenure as Prime Minister, by Italian standards, and to Giulio
                            Andreotti's long service as Minister of Defense. But this
                            brought forth only grunts, and no praise from the General for either of
                            them. He did say, however, that while General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had suffered a setback in the
                            recent French elections, it was a noteworthy fact that despite this,
                            Gaullism had retained an absolute majority in Parliament. This was, the
                            General said, thanks to the fact that the French had succeeded in
                            working out an electoral system which made such absolute majority
                            governments possible, whereas Italy had not succeeded in doing this and
                            therefore had to suffer constantly with unstable coalitions.</p>
                        <p>The General, who is not yet 60 and still apparently in vigorous health,
                            strongly implied that he would not be adverse after retiring to giving
                            his support to, and perhaps even participating in, a movement in Italy
                            for a stronger form of central government, if conditions should occur
                            that might give such a movement reasonable chances of success. I do not
                            think the General would himself go so far as to try to become an Italian
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. He seems too
                            realistic about himself and Italian politics to attempt that. But he
                            might lend his support very vigorously to someone else who had
                            aspirations and possibilities of becoming a strong President, if he
                            believed him to be the right man for the job.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Affairs</p>
                        <p>On foreign affairs the General's main comments were on <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and Germany.</p>
                        <p>As for <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> he said there was of course
                            great merit in the idea of trying to prevent the further proliferation
                            of nuclear weapons. But the proposed treaty, he said, seemed unfair to
                            Italy and to other nuclear have-not nations. He used many of the same
                            arguments to support this that Italian government leaders have voiced,
                            and I sought to answer them in the usual way. He said he had been asked
                            recently, but did not say by whom, what younger officers in the Italian
                            Army thought about this subject. He said he had answered that he did not
                            think they were much interested.</p>
                        <p>As for Germany he said he felt there was a very real danger of a strong
                            revival of a Nazi-type Party. Many Germans remembered bitterly the bad
                            treatment they received in 1945 and 1946, he said. This feeling was
                            especially strong among the millions of German refugees from East
                            Germany. This and the continued lack of progress towards reunification
                            was in danger of stirring up the same stubborn and ruthless German
                            spirit which had caused two world wars and could if we are not careful
                            cause a third. He remarked that some Germans were <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0300"/>involved in the constant acts of
                            terrorism in Italy's Alto Adige and that the Italian
                            Government had not been able to get the German Government to crack down
                            on these people.</p>
                        <p>With particular reference to this last subject, but by inference also to
                            other things he had been saying, General <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName> remarked that the Chief of Staff of the Italian

                                US HUMPHREY)</note> on US-Italian Relations and <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> opened by welcoming Vice
                            President as representative of Italy's greatest ally.
                            US-Italian relations are not only matter of treaty but of far deeper
                            links of blood, tradition, history. Whatever happens, Saragat said, our
                            friendship will remain firm. Italy works for European unity, but always
                            in frame of partnership with US; President Kennedy's
                            partnership idea is what guides Italian policy. But US-Italian
                            friendship is also not exclusive. It is part of effort to reduce tension
                            throughout world.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> then said that against
                            this background he would like to discuss <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He would speak as president of parliamentary republic.
                            As such he is not responsible for policies of govt, but is nevertheless
                            in complete agreement with policies of <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> govt.</p>
                        <p>3. Vice President, thanking him for expressing views of US-Italian
                            relations that are exactly like those of US Govt, said his presence in
                            Rome showed that Atlantic partnership is continuing commitment of
                            President Johnson. He agreed also that Atlantic Alliance is what makes
                            approach to East possible. Finally VP emphasized that President Johnson
                            feels strongly that US involvement in Asia in no way lessens interest in
                            Europe, indeed it increases it. US spent 20 years building Alliance in
                            Europe; wants no weakening of it now. US, in its position of world
                            responsibility of chief of state. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]</p>

                        <p>[4.] <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> stated that under
                            Article XI of Italian Constitution, Italy may accept limits on its
                            sovereignty in the interests of peace only if it does so on an equal
                            basis with other countries, and that any treaty which would establish
                            such limitations without such equality would involve
                            Saragat's personal responsibility for carrying out of
                            Constitution.</p>
                        <p>5. Saying he didn't want to get into details of <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, he said Italy has always wanted such a
                            treaty knowing well the dangers of nuclear conflict and
                            proliferation.</p>
                        <p>6. Italy could speak frankly because it had a clear conscience.
                            Technically and financially, Italy could have a bomb in four years if it
                            started to build one now or could have had one now if it had started
                            earlier. Italy does not want to have a bomb. This was position not only
                            of GOI but of large part of government opposition. Italy
                            doesn't want to involve itself in a nuclear force and
                            doesn't want to get into the nuclear club. Hence, Italy
                            doesn't need reins on it to keep it in line.</p>
                        <p>7. Given this situation, Italy wanted a treaty which would not be unfair
                            to countries which do not want their own nuclear arms. Such a treaty
                            should contribute to real relaxation of tension and perhaps to reduction
                            of armaments.</p>
                        <p>8. Treaty should also be in harmony with other Italian foreign policies.
                            It should not be an obstacle to European unity or put in danger Italian
                            security.</p>
                        <p>9. Hence Italy must ask what other countries would sign. Italy cannot
                            forget the area in which it lives, and doesn't want to be put
                            into a position of inequality. Italy is a leading industrial power in
                            the Mediterranean basin and cannot accept a position of inferiority to
                            Mediterranean countries of lesser industrial capacity.</p>
                        <p>10. Also Italy needs peaceful nuclear energy for its technological
                            development. Lacking in natural resources and with a large and growing
                            population, Italy needs the atom to help it deal with economic problems.
                            The treaty must not block Italy's industrial development.</p>
                        <p>11. In text of proposed treaty Saragat saw points on which Italian
                            position was not fully taken into account. He mentioned the question of
                            control, which also concerns the chief of state because Italy cannot
                            accept juridical discrimination. Nuclear have-nots must have equal
                            rights with nuclear-have countries. Any humiliation or inferiority
                            imposed upon Italy would provoke profound political problems. There were
                            similar problems he thought for Germany, but he would leave that to
                            Germany to discuss.</p>
                        <p>12. Answering President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>,
                            the Vice President said that in US view there were very few topics of
                            greater importance than proposed <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                            The US considered this to be a priority matter and a definite step to
                            arms control and disarmament. It was essential for peace of world to
                            keep nuclear arms from proliferation. Countries could be <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0302"/>militant whether they were large or
                            small, and if they had nuclear arms they could be very dangerous. There
                            were already five fingers on the nuclear trigger, some of them nervous.
                            US wants to limit further proliferation if possible. Question is how. US
                            certainly does not want in any way to infringe upon Italian
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>13. Vice President then explained time table US is proposing for the
                            treaty, pointing out that our draft has been under consideration since
                            January and that a series of steps are now proposed for further
                            discussion which we hope may lead to the tabling of draft treaty in May.
                            Even when draft is tabled it will be subject to review and amendments.
                            But US considers it important not to delay longer. Before talking with
                            Soviets again the US will do its utmost to arrive at agreement with its
                            allies on the draft. US has the fullest consideration for rights of
                            other nations.</p>
                        <p>14. Then dealing with specific objections that had been raised in various
                            ways, Vice President said there was nothing in the treaty which could
                            stand in the way of a federated Europe or a united Europe having its own
                            nuclear arms. He pointed out the treaty only specifies what cannot be
                            done and does not attempt to specify what can be done.</p>
                        <p>15. VP said Italians suggest treaty should be associated with
                            disarmament. US thinks it is, but he agreed with Fanfani who had so
                            stated earlier that this can be stated in preamble and was prepared to
                            consider whether it would be well to place further such reference in an
                            appropriate article. Whether this was done in draft or in Geneva after
                            tabling was matter of tactics. There is merit to coming to table with
                            strong treaty.</p>
                        <p>16. Nothing in treaty would impinge upon peaceful nuclear technology. US
                            however knows Italy's views on control and Euratom, and
                            because of this US will offer revised Article III. This will require
                            much discussion. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will soon receive
                            details. US also knows about concern over industrial aspects, especially
                            in Germany. US doesn't want in any way to impair
                            others' civilian nuclear technology. This is part of modern
                            industry, and Italy has right to it. US will do all it can to assure
                            this, and will tell Soviets so. This is why such discussion is so
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>17. As for security, VP said of course US wanted no impairment of this.
                            He would add, however, that it would take long time before smaller
                            countries could make bombs. China had done so because it had tested in
                            atmosphere. But <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Israel are
                            signatories of Test Ban Treaty and cannot test in air. Also there is
                            very little industrial spin off from military nuclear development. What
                            there is is highly expensive. To have industrial benefits it was
                            necessary to have civilian nuclear program, not military. Finally, VP
                            said Italy's security and that of US are based in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. If any country threatened Italy with
                            nuclear arms, as member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Italy
                            has commitment of US to come to its help, and US has nuclear arms enough
                            for the job.</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0303"/>
                        <p>18. Partnership is important: US needs Italy, Italy needs the US. US will
                            keep its commitments. That is why US is involved in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> today—to keep its
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>19. Discussion was interrupted here for luncheon. <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> asked VP to convey his warmest

                        <p>Subject: Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Date: April 26, 1967.</p>
                        <p>Place: Presidential Residence in Bonn.</p>
                        <p>After an initial exchange of pleasant amenities during which Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> underlined the
                            significance of President Johnson's presence at the Adenauer
                            funeral, the Italian Prime Minister made a series <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0304"/>of comments on the Non-Proliferation
                            Treaty and its importance in terms of European and Atlantic Alliance
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> said that
                            certain aspects of the Treaty were a source of concern to Italy and in
                            the past the Italians had already made solid observations and presented
                            certain amendments which were being considered by the United States. In
                            view of the fact that the ever greater consolidation of the Atlantic
                            solidarity was a most vital objective, the Prime Minister felt concerned
                            about aspects of the Treaty, namely its structure as well as its
                            contents. As far as Italy was concerned it had no nuclear ambitions. It
                            was also expected that Germany would abide by its unilateral decision.
                            But when it comes to shifting from unilateral decisions to a permanent
                            arrangement regarding nuclear weapons, an arrangement which would
                            overlap to a certain extent the guarantees required by the Atlantic
                            Alliance, certain serious political problems might arise.</p>
                        <p>Italy understood the intentions of the United States and the concern of
                            the United States in avoiding the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
                            all the dangers contained in such proliferation. It is obvious that any
                            observation made by Italy is based on the assumption that nuclear
                            armaments should be subject to controls. But Italy has some misgivings
                            about the permanent solution as proposed in the Treaty, particularly as
                            regards the clause whereby in theory a country could withdraw. It is
                            difficult for Italy to visualize how a country could renounce armaments
                            without experiencing serious internal difficulties than we are prepared
                            to cope with. Italy felt that the Treaty should be formulated in a
                            provisional or temporary manner, leaving the possibility of renouncing
                            nuclear weapons for a time in the future when there would be greater
                            international solidarity. If this provisional or temporary connotation
                            were to be introduced in the Treaty Italy then would not have any
                            particularly strong objections.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then expressed some misgivings about the eventual
                            position in Europe of Germany and Italy, as those countries might be
                            squeezed between two nuclear powers such as the Soviet Union and France.
                            If that situation were to develop, there might be an evolution in
                            European political attitudes leading to a weakening of the ties with the
                            United States, and strong ties with the United States was one of the
                            underlying elements of Italian foreign policy. Italy was not at this
                            time defending the German position as the Germans could do that very
                            well on their own. But it was important to mention one significant
                            aspect of the political life of Europe, namely the one of whether
                            Germany was to be brought into the Alliance as a full and equal partner.
                            Italy was concerned that any marked changes in the assurances given to
                            Germany with regards to potential Soviet threats might bring about a
                            strong public opinion reaction in Germany. That in turn could have
                            unfavorable repercussions on public opinion within <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0305"/>the Atlantic Alliance since the effect
                            of German participation is of vital importance.</p>
                        <p>Italy was also seriously concerned about the fact that a
                            Non-Proliferation Treaty which had not been fully thought out might
                            delay or even jeopardize European unity. And even though it was not
                            anticipated that the European nations would join in a closely knit
                            federation in the near future, it was an objective of unity that should
                            be attained, such unity being also one of the basic elements of United
                            States foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister pointed out that the Italian observations were already
                            well known by the United States. He wanted to add that this nuclear
                            problem was essentially a political one. He felt that the Treaty in its
                            present form might have very serious repercussions on European politics
                            and furthermore it could have a negative effect on the Atlantic
                            Alliance. That was a matter of great concern for Italy since support of
                            the Alliance was a vital element of Italian foreign policy. And it was
                            because Italy attached such great importance to solidarity within the
                            Alliance that he felt it his duty to call to the attention of his US
                            friends the possible consequences of the Treaty. He then made reference
                            to the MLF which had never come into being, saying that abandoning the
                            idea of multilateral force based on equal participation by European
                            countries and agreeing to an arrangement that would discriminate
                            permanently against certain European countries could have serious
                            consequences as far as democracy in Europe was concerned.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson said that he had appreciated this opportunity for a
                            frank and candid discussion. He was fully aware of Italy's
                            concerns with regard to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> and
                            wanted to say at the outset that the United States was not contemplating
                            any agreement that would be displeasing to its allies, including the
                            Italians. The United States indeed valued very highly the friendship of
                            Italy which it considered as a very important ally and therefore the
                            United States did give most serious consideration to the observations
                            presented by Italy. He assured the Prime Minister that the United States
                            was aware of the views presented by other nations and he felt that no
                            real progress could be made on the Treaty without the knowledge and
                            consent of other nations, including Italy. He had already listened to
                            the expressions of concern indicated by India, Germany, Italy and other
                            nations and all of those views, on the part of neutrals as well as on
                            the part of our allies would be taken into consideration in the attempt
                            to arrive at some language that would offer the greatest measure of
                            hope. And of the views presented none were more welcome than those of
                            Italy. He then pointed out that of course the United States was not
                            ready to produce a treaty in the next 24 hours and the Prime Minister
                            could be sure that before the United States made up its mind it would
                            explain its position fully. At the same time he thought that there might
                            be some unnecessary concern on the <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0306"/>part of such countries as India, Germany and Italy and
                            he wondered whether a greater understanding could be reached by more
                            complete exchanges of views among technicians. As a matter of fact, the
                            United States has already made some substantial adjustments in the
                            proposed treaty as a result of suggestions made by several countries. It
                            was very important for the United States to have the fullest possible
                            understanding on the part of Italy since Italian opinion and support was
                            of the greatest significance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made two brief
                            comments, first mentioning the many difficulties still existing with the
                            Soviets. He pointed out that there was no treaty between Washington and
                            Moscow as well as no treaty in Geneva. Therefore, European unity was not
                            being affected, and European unity was a point on which the United
                            States would not surrender. Then there was the matter of safeguards and
                            in this connection if there was no full understanding among the Alliance
                            there could be no treaty. He felt that all problems within the Alliance
                            could be solved satisfactorily except one, that dealing with the
                            reservations on the option to develop national nuclear power. If the
                            above-mentioned problem could be set aside everything else could be
                            easily solved. He then made a reference to the fact that if the security
                            arrangements of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were to disappear,
                            this might lead certain <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                            to withdraw from the Treaty. He said in conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> might cause problems within the
                            Alliance, however, the proliferation of nuclear weapons would destroy
                            the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> said that he
                            was concerned about the danger that might be caused by the Treaty in its
                            present form and the possible proliferation. Therefore, all efforts
                            should be made so as to avoid any such danger.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson stated once more that he had been very glad to hear the
                            views presented by the Italian Prime Minister. He wanted to say that one
                            had not yet reached the stage where there might be cause for alarm. As a
                            matter of fact the discussions had been on problems that may not present
                            themselves anyway. And once more he reiterated the intention of the
                            United States of not taking any steps that might displease our
                            allies.</p>

                        <p>The Air Transport Services Agreement with Italy<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">For text of the agreement, signed in Rome June 9,
                                1947, and entered into force that day, see 61 Stat. 4074.</note>
                            will expire on June 1 as a result of Italian denunciation.
                            Italy's principal dissatisfaction with the present Agreement
                            has been that it gave them no routes beyond the United States, whereas
                            American carriers since World War II have operated to Italy and beyond.
                            This led to a revenue imbalance, undoubtedly of concern to Italy ($51.9
                            million for the United States and $44.6 million for Italy in 1965).
                            United States offers in 1964 and 1965 consultations to improve
                            Italy's routes failed because Italy wanted at the same time
                            to introduce controls on the freedom and volume of US air services to
                            Italy which we could not accept. Negotiations for a new agreement
                            February 20 to March 8 made no progress. Italy is demanding a vast route
                            package for itself—including routes both beyond New York to
                            Mexico City and beyond Los Angeles to Tokyo—that in its
                            entirety is just out of the question, and, at the same time, is
                            insisting on cutting down possible routes that US carriers might serve
                            under the present Agreement. Moreover, Italy has refused to discuss the
                            operational principles until its route demands are satisfied.</p>
                        <p>During the Vice President's recent trip to Italy, Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> indicated
                            Italy's great concern with our air negotiations, declaring
                            that it was time to take a “hard political look”

                            account in preparing the United States position. In view of the Prime
                            Minister's intervention, it was arranged with Italy to
                            postpone the resumption of negotiations to May 2, so that we could ask
                            you to review and approve this position. Essentially, we propose to
                            offer the Italians a route package that includes the traffic rights they
                            presently have plus a round-the-world route that they want very much. We
                            will again offer them a round-the-world route via Miami to Mexico City
                            and beyond, but if they reject this, we may have to give them instead a
                            route via Los Angeles or San Francisco and across the Pacific to Tokyo.
                            We would want, in exchange, route opportunities for our carriers similar
                            to those we now enjoy, including affirmation of certain beyond rights
                            that we are not now operating. We would also insist on an agreement
                            based on established US aviation policy regarding capacity and other
                            operational principles. Italy may continue to demand both the route
                            beyond the West Coast and the route to Mexico. We are opposed to this
                            because it is not justified on aviation considerations.</p>
                        <p>To preclude Italian miscalculation that the United States might be pushed
                            into concessions on routes or capacity principles greater than we have
                            contemplated, we believe it necessary to advise Italy that we are
                            prepared, albeit reluctantly, to accept cessation of air services
                            between the two countries rather than get into an agreement or an ad hoc
                            situation inconsistent with US interests. We recognize that termination
                            of air services would represent failure to reach agreement on
                            essentially a commercial endeavor with one of our strongest supporters
                            in all aspects of Free World cooperation, including <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Atlantic Community affairs and
                            international monetary reform. Nevertheless, we believe that this
                            approach is realistic, sensible and fair. If we cannot achieve an
                            acceptable agreement, you would be asked to make a final determination
                            on the cancellation of air services and would be presented with all
                            relevant factors for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>This Department, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the new Secretary of
                            Transportation and the US carriers all recognize that this negotiation
                            is a particularly important one; failure to reach a new agreement would
                            result in some possibly serious political repercussions in our relations
                            with Italy, and could involve some transportation tie-ups. On the other
                            hand, if the Italians—one of our strongest aviation
                            partners—were able by denouncing the agreement to get us to
                            make undue concessions on routes or on our fundamental capacity
                            principles, our submission would be a signal to others to do likewise.
                            (Spain has already told us officially that it may denounce its agreement
                            to get what it wants, depending on what happens in the Italian
                            negotiations.)</p>
                        <p>The three American carriers operating to Italy have committed themselves
                            in writing to support cessation of services if an acceptable <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0309"/>agreement cannot be worked out. It is
                            also widely accepted that Italy deserves to be given good routes.
                            However, Pan Am, Northwest and a few other carriers that hope to get
                            into the West Coast-Orient market in the future (but not TWA), oppose
                            the grant of a West Coast-Tokyo route to Italy. Eastern is violently
                            against granting New York-Mexico City to Italy, but is less opposed to a
                            Miami-Mexico grant. We believe the grant of either the Miami-Mexico
                            route or the transpacific route from California is justified to get a
                            good agreement with Italy. On the other hand, to go beyond what we are
                            proposing to grant Italy would without question generate intense
                            dissatisfaction and opposition from virtually all US airlines. A
                            settlement along the lines I am recommending will cause some
                            dissatisfaction, as mentioned above, but our best judgment is that there
                            will be grudging recognition of its unavoidability, and little or no
                            public criticism by our airlines.<note n="5" xml:id="d130fn5">In a May 3

                        <p>The State Department has been holding informal discussions with the
                            Italians about a broad agreement for cooperation in scientific
                            activities. The Italians started the talks because they are interested
                            in strengthening their bilateral relationships with us on these matters
                            and we have responded because of certain attractions we can see in
                            having <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0310"/>a broad
                            “umbrella” agreement with them that would serve
                            both scientific and foreign policy purposes.</p>
                        <p>Last November Professor Vincenzo Caglioti, the President of the National
                            Research Council of Italy, and some of his associates visited Washington
                            and a specific draft agreement was discussed.<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">No record of this meeting has been found.</note>
                            However, it was agreed that signing should be deferred until specific
                            projects could also be announced.</p>
                        <p>Several collaborative projects are now ready for initiation and final
                            preparations are being made to conclude the agreement. Present planning
                            is for an agreement to be signed in Washington early in June with the
                            Under Secretary of State and Dr. Hornig signing for the U.S., and
                            Leopoldo Rubinacci, the Italian Minister for Coordination of Science and
                            Technology, signing for Italy. It is also contemplated that certain
                            members of Congress will be participating in the signing ceremony.</p>
                        <p>This sort of “umbrella” agreement, not restricted
                            to specific fields of science nor to specific agencies or institutions,
                            represents for the U.S. an innovation in the conduct of international
                            science relations. Copies are enclosed of the draft agreement and the
                            guidelines developed for the Executive Agency that will coordinate this
                            program on the U.S. side (it is intended that the National Science
                            Foundation serve as the U.S. Executive Agency). Both the draft agreement
                            and the guidelines have been favorably reviewed by the Federal Council
                            for Science and Technology.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">For text of the

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> reviewed at
                            considerable length the Italian political situation and described the
                            ingredients of the Center-Left coalition. Being a coalition, it was
                            inevitably fuzzy around the edges at times and the recent hassle within
                            the coalition about Italian Middle East policy was attributable to the
                            nature of the coalition. The Ambassador pointed out, however, that the
                            formal position of the Italian Government, including all members of the
                            coalition, was that there should be not the slightest deviation from
                            Italy's friendly approach to American foreign policy
                            positions. He wished to make this clear, particularly in light of the
                            circumstances relating to Ambassador Fenoaltea's
                            resignation.</p>

                            table the draft with Article III blank, but he did not exclude this as a
                            possibility. Much may depend on the outcome of the Hollybush
                            conversations. The Secretary had told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that some countries were concerned that there
                            should be a limitation on the life of the treaty. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s view was
                            noncommittal but that if there were a limitation, it would have to be of
                            long duration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said
                            that if the Soviets were adamant about using <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> safeguards only, this would cause serious difficulties
                            for the treaty.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> said that the
                            whole question of safeguards and the Soviet attitude toward <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> came at a most unfortunate time
                            when there was a “prise de conscience” within the
                            European communities, particularly <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> said he wondered whether it would be desirable
                            for the new fused Commission to re-examine the safeguards question. Mr.
                            Rey would be taking over in July and it was the Ambassador's
                            personal thought that the new Commission might wish to re-examine the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Soviet Pipeline</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was not aware of the present status of
                            negotiations on the natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union. He said
                            that when he was Secretary General, the Foreign Office had instructed
                                <gloss target="#t_ENI1">ENI</gloss> to diversify on oil and gas and
                            not limit its dependence on the Soviet Union. <gloss target="#t_ENI1">ENI</gloss> had been told not to make the Soviet Union the only
                            source of gas, and that it should go on talking with the Dutch, Libyans,
                            and Algerians. Unfortunately, the Dutch price was very high and the cost
                            of building the pipeline from the north would be considerable. He did
                            not know what the Libyan situation would be now. Dealing with the
                            Algerians was always very difficult. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> recalled that while he was in the
                            Foreign Office, he had tried to make that body the coordinator of
                            Italian Government energy policy, but he had to confess that he had
                            failed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> handed Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> a memorandum covering a
                            report from Ambassador Catalano in Cairo. Ambassador Catalano had drawn
                            attention to the dramatic situation in Egypt following its defeat and
                            reported on the views of certain Egyptians that it would be desirable
                            for Washington to make some gesture toward the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> which could serve to make the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> realize that it was not necessary to pay no matter what
                            price to the Soviets for their support. Ambassador Catalano had
                            indicated that certain persons in Cairo, including those close to
                            Nasser, were preoccupied regarding the establishment of contact with the
                            United States. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> could
                            not be considered as a channel because of French opposition to the
                            United States. Therefore, other channels were required and Italy had
                            apparently been selected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said he did not see much
                            hope for any gesture being made by Washington to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> under present circumstances. With
                            regard to Soviet actions vis-á-visthe <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, the present estimate of the British and ourselves was
                            that the Soviets were resupplying a portion of <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> losses, but would not go so far as to attempt to
                            rebuild the entire Egyptian force. It was the British estimate that it
                            would take the Soviets a full year to resupply everything that had been
                            lost. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>
                            <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0313"/>indicated that there were
                            reports and rumors, so far unconfirmed, that the Soviets were trying to
                            get naval bases in the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and/or in
                            Syria.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> then reported
                            that he had just received another telegram from Cairo which was dated
                            June 23. In this, Ambassador Catalano reported that he had seen the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Under Secretary for Foreign
                            Affairs, El Feki, shortly after his (Catalano's) return from
                            Rome. El Feki had drawn Catalano's attention to the fact that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> would be satisfied if the
                            General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for withdrawal to
                            positions occupied prior to June 5, but without a condemnation of Israel
                            for aggression. El Feki had added that if such a resolution were not
                            passed, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was preparing ways to
                            bring about withdrawal by other means. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> commented that
                            Nasser's prestige seemed to be enhanced by the Podgorny visit
                            and by Soviet resupply actions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Civil Aviation</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>'s question, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> said that the United States and
                            Italy still seemed far apart on two or three issues. While he would make
                            certain comments, he did not wish to negotiate, since he was not
                            technically competent and this should be left to the negotiators.
                            Speaking generally, he said Alitalia was psychologically motivated by
                            two main points. The first was that the original agreement had been
                            conceived when Italy had no civil aviation and thus Italy had been
                            obliged to sign what may be described as an “armistice
                            agreement.” The agreement was obsolete and it could not
                            protect the interests of the big company which Alitalia had become. The
                            second point was that Alitalia had an enormous fear that without the due
                            protection which could be achieved by a new agreement, Alitalia would be
                            submerged by the enormous capacity and strength of the U.S. companies.
                            However, it was very difficult to translate all of this into a new
                            agreement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName>
                            recalled that although Italy had been given Los Angeles a number of
                            years ago, it had never been able to fly there because other questions,
                            such as capacity and Bermuda principles, had blocked the way. The other
                            major difficulty was to obtain a balanced route concession. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> said that as Secretary
                            General of the Foreign Office, he had seen Carandini of Alitalia,
                            General Santini, Ambassador Capomazza, and others and pleaded with them
                            to solve the problem before May 31. He had pointed out that failure to
                            reach an agreement might lead to serious problems, including cessation.
                            The Ambassador admitted that his approach had also been somewhat
                            objective since he had desired to eliminate this problem before coming
                            to Washington. The reply which had been given him was that Alitalia was
                            prepared to accept anything, including cessation, rather than an
                            agreement which was not viable. Ambassador Ortona told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> that against the strong
                            opposition of Alitalia, <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0314"/>the
                            Italian Government was preparing to present something to us on capacity
                            which he thought might be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>There ensued a rather inconclusive exchange with respect to the routes.
                            The Ambassador indicated that Italy believed it should serve the same
                            places in the United States that the U.S. carriers departed from. Italy
                            had only been offered four U.S. points. He also mentioned Italian
                            desires for Atlanta, Dallas, and beyond to Mexico, and said that the
                            United States thought it should keep not only what it had in the
                            previous agreement, but also obtain Australia and Africa. He noted that
                            we had informally said we would give up Australia and Africa, but that
                            this had never become a formal position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Stabler</persName> said we could not formalize this position if the
                            Italians continued to reject our offer of Los Angeles and beyond to
                            Tokyo. We therefore continued to maintain our requests. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Stabler</persName> said that we believed that any
                            agreement to be acceptable would have to be an economically balanced
                            one. It was out of the question for us to give to the Italians routes
                            which provided Alitalia with a far greater revenue than that earned by
                            the American airlines serving Italy combined. We had placed certain
                            valuations on the routes and had explained these to the Italians. While
                            the Italians had rejected the valuations, they had never come up with
                            any of their own nor explained the basis or the justification for their
                            requests. We had to view the routes as economic questions and the best
                            hope for the achievement of an agreement between the United States and
                            Italy would be for the Italian side to prepare a basis for evaluating
                            the revenue earning capacity of their routes. If we could agree on a
                            formula for evaluating routes and could accept the fact that there had
                            to be economically balanced route concessions, then it might be possible
                            to achieve agreement.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in response to a query as to the present status of the Italian
                            and American airlines, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Stabler</persName>
                            said that the airlines were flying normally with each side having filed
                            applications for renewal of permits. As long as no one endeavored to
                            restrict the other side, there should be no problem. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> recognized that if the
                            Italians tried to interfere with our services, there would be a sharp
                            reaction on our side. He gave the impression that Italy did not intend
                            to place any restrictions on U.S. airlines.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ortona</persName> said he did not
                            know when negotiations might begin again. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Stabler</persName> said he understood that there had been some talk
                            of September, but that we were waiting to hear of Italian wishes in this
                            regard.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> said that another
                            matter of concern was the Export-Import Bank loan to Fiat.<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">During an October 7, 1966, speech in New York,
                                President Johnson announced that the Export-Import Bank was ready to
                                guarantee Italy credit for the purchase of U.S.-made equipment for
                                the Togliattigrad Fiat plant. For text of his statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                                    States: <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                                    Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book II, pp. 1125-1130. In 1967
                                both the House and Senate adopted amendments to the Export-Import
                                Bank authorization legislation that banned the loan
                                guarantees.</note> Although it was not of major importance, it had a
                            definite psychological value. Fiat was a private corporation whose
                            operations were less subject to public scrutiny than were those of
                            Alitalia. Fiat has an annual turnover of approximately $2 billion. It
                            employs some 12,000 workers and was obviously no small company. The
                            transaction in question concerned a loan of $50 million. Fiat does not
                            need the money. Its President could take this amount from his own
                            pocket. $50 million represents only about one-fortieth of
                            Fiat's annual turnover. The Fiat proposal to construct an
                            automobile industry in the Soviet Union was motivated by the desire to
                            encourage a commercially-orientated economy in the Soviet Union. It was
                            also motivated by the desire to promote a higher living standard and
                            possibly a subsequent reduction of military expenditures. Fiat is not
                            going to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to produce missiles.
                            Rather it will produce automobiles and hopefully will contribute to the
                            improvement of the lot of Soviet workers and consumers. This would
                            contribute to the cause of peace and by promoting a consumer-oriented
                            economy would play a part in promoting the evolution of democracy in the
                            Soviet Union. The $50 million <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0317"/>loan had not been requested by Fiat from the standpoint of need.
                            Rather the purpose was to show that the Fiat project had no
                            anti-American overtones, and to insure that it could not be exploited
                            for political or ideological reasons. For this reason, the problems
                            which arise from the blocking of the loan are not financial, but are
                            psychological.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was not altogether familiar with this aspect
                            of the subject, but would have the matter carefully reviewed. He said
                            that the Administration agreed that the Fiat project is a constructive
                            and useful step and that we are in accord with the goals which it seeks
                            to achieve. For this reason, we had asked the Ex-Im Bank to approve the
                            loan. In our opinion, the Fiat transaction would have effects in the
                            Soviet Union that would be in the interests of all the parties involved.
                            Unfortunately, some members of Congress had felt that to approve the
                            loan would be giving aid to the Communists. It sometimes takes a
                            considerable amount of time to educate some of the members of
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President said that for the last four years, the Administration had
                            been successful with Congress both on the domestic front and in
                            international affairs. However, we were now approaching an election year
                            and anything that can be used to embarrass the Administration is fully
                            exploited by the opposition and even by some members of the party in
                            power. The latter may have presidential aspirations or other individual
                            interests which they wish to promote. Thus, many things that the
                            Administration feels are worthwhile run into obstacles and we then must
                            wait until after the elections or “until the Republicans take
                            over.” The President assured President Saragat that he would
                            do everything possible to have the matter reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> said that in his
                            contacts with the late Professor Valletta, former President of Fiat, he
                            had been told that it was essential to know exactly where the US stood
                            before entering into a contract with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> said that had the US expressed opposition, Fiat
                            would not have signed the agreement. He said that the Italian Communists
                            find themselves in a very uncomfortable situation each time visitors
                            from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> arrive in Italy and then
                            make a point of expressing their admiration for Fiat.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson said that he himself owned a Fiat convertible about
                            which he is very enthusiastic.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Rumor said that as a responsible representative of the Italian
                            Christian Democratic Party, he wished to convey some information which
                            the President, who shoulders such great responsibilities throughout the
                            world, might be pleased to hear. Mr. Rumor said that the Italian
                            political situation today is characterized by stability. He said that
                            the center-left coalition and the inter-party agreements are working
                            well and will continue on a solid footing for a long while to come. Mr.
                            Rumor said that he and his associates had from the beginning felt that
                            the United States would stand behind them in the efforts they had been
                            making in recent years. They were convinced that they were moving on the
                            right path toward the stability of democratic institutions in Italy. Mr.
                            Rumor said that this political stability had benefitted the economy as
                            well, to the extent that Italy had recovered from the 1964
                            recession.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rumor said that the Italian national elections in 1968, which will
                            take place before those to be held in the United States, promised to be
                            of particular significance. Hopefully the elections will further
                            consolidate the existing situation in Italy. It was because of these
                            elections that his discussion with the President was of significant
                            importance. Mr. Rumor said that to put the matter simply, the work being
                            carried out in Italy is undertaken with the knowledge that America,
                            despite its geographic distance, stands behind them.</p>
                        <p>The President assured Mr. Rumor that no one takes greater interest in
                            these matters than we in the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0319"/>
                        <p>Mr. Rumor thanked the President and said that he was quite sure that this
                            was true for, in fact, Italy represented a sort of boundary line with
                            the Communist East. For this reason, the success of the Christian
                            Democratic Party contributes to the strength of democracy throughout
                            Europe. In addition, it promotes the development of unity in the
                            European Community which the United States desires and in which the
                            United States places its confidence. Mr. Rumor said, however, that there
                            are some roadblocks to be overcome such as the resistance on the part of
                            the French. With patience and perseverance, however, our efforts will
                            succeed and we will arrive at the day when Great Britain will join
                            Europe and when political unification will be attained.</p>
                        <p>The President said that no one should have the impression that there is
                            any less interest in the United States concerning the affairs of our
                            friends in Italy and in Europe because of the problems which we must
                            cope with in other parts of the world. He said that our interest in
                            Latin America, Africa, and especially Viet-Nam caused no diminution in
                            our interest in Europe. The President said that we will continue to do
                            our duty in these other areas, but we will also continue consistently to
                            give our attention and understanding to matters of concern to
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>When President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> visited you
                            he raised the issue of U.S.-Italian civil aviation relations. He said
                            that the former U.S.-Italian Civil Aviation Agreement, which Italy
                            renounced, gave Italy less generous terms than the agreements we had
                            with Germany, France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            suggested its terms were related to the World War II armistice
                            settlement. He said that this issue was of considerable psychological
                            importance to Italy and you assured him that you would have the problem
                            carefully reviewed.</p>

                        <p>At Tab A is a letter from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">Not printed.</note> transmitting on your
                            behalf our comments on President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>'s remarks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has approved the letter.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> letter makes the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—the former agreement was not related to the armistice
                            settlement;</p>
                        <p>—it provided U.S. and Italian carriers approximately equal
                            revenue opportunities. On this criterion, which is fundamental to all
                            our aviation negotiations, it was equal to our agreements with other
                            countries, including Germany, France and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>—the U.S. is prepared to grant Italy new commercial air rights
                            as valuable as those it would obtain from Italy in exchange. We made a
                            valuable new offer in our most recent negotiations because we very much
                            wanted to settle this issue. We continue to be willing to consider other
                            alternatives consistent with the principle of obtaining overall economic
                            balance;</p>
                        <p>—we want to get an exchange of views going again so that we
                            can settle this issue.</p>
                        <p>The letter closes the door on any further review by yourself. State
                            believes, and I think it is probably right, that unless we do this we
                            will not be able to get the Italians back to the table to negotiate a
                            fair commercial bargain.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Meeting of the President with President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>, and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fanfani</persName>, Saturday evening, December
                                23, 1967, at President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>'s villa, Castel Porziano</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> had talked
                            privately with President Johnson for about 20 minutes before the meeting
                            started. The following is an account of the more general session.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> opened by
                            expressing his pleasure at the recent wedding in the Johnson family. He
                            said he had met Captain Robb and had thought him a fine soldier. He also
                            took the occasion to wish the President and his family a happy
                            Christmas.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson expressed his appreciation. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> then said it was a time to reaffirm
                            the feelings of friendship which were again conveyed on President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>'s recent
                            trip to the United States. The President's current visit
                            indicates American solidarity with Italy and with Europe in general.
                            Europe needs that sense of solidarity and support from the U.S.; and
                            Europe in turn must reciprocate. That is the central point of Italian
                            policy: collaboration between Europe and the U.S. There were, obviously,
                            difficulties in Europe, which saddened and worried the Prime Minister.
                            There were those trying to prevent European unity and trying to make
                            U.S.-European relations more difficult. But Italy and the U.S. must
                            remain loyal to the concept of a unified Europe which worked in intimate
                            collaboration with the U.S. Italy was determined to see the possibility
                            of U.K. entry into Europe not damaged. But Italy doesn't want
                            to break up what has already been built in Europe. Therefore, he hopes
                            the U.K. will continue to indicate its interest in joining Europe. Italy
                            will maintain a policy of constructive solidarity with both the U.K. and
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>President Johnson expressed his satisfaction at the continuity of these
                            enlightened Italian policies, as expressed by President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>, and the whole Italian government.
                            It is a marvel of modern communications that we can exchange views
                            frequently face to face. He almost always found his own views in harmony
                            with those of the Italian government; for example, they were explored in
                            detail in Washington when President <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> was there. Moreover, the <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0322"/>American people are the friends of the
                            Italian people, and want the U.S. Government to work with the Government
                            of Italy. This underlying human feeling has strengthened both
                            governments over the past 20 years. Specifically, the President was
                            pleased with our common support for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which we had reaffirmed at Adenauer's
                            funeral. He was grateful for the collaboration between the U.S. and
                            Italian monetary authorities. He appreciated Carli's recent
                            support in the wake of the British devaluation. He was sure that Italy
                            would not regret having supported the U.S. position. When the U.S. was a
                            surplus country, we undertook the responsibility of helping deficit
                            countries. We now look to the surplus countries to help us carry our
                            burdens until we can get into balance. We shall be taking stringent
                            steps in the near future with respect to our balance of payments,
                            notably with respect to investments abroad. By wisely handling our
                            investments, we can begin to turn a deficit into a surplus, which we
                            intend to do. But we do not want to damage the liquidity position of
                            others. We appreciated in the past, and look in the future to continued
                            collaboration of Italy, Netherlands, and others who have been such good
                            partners.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Vietnam. The tribute of the Asians to Prime Minister Holt was a
                            tribute to the enlightened policy in Asia of white Australia. The
                            growing solidarity of Free Asia was apparent to all of us in Canberra
                            and Melbourne. It is evident that the North Vietnamese and those who
                            support them cannot win in South Vietnam. The problem is how to apply
                            enough pressure to bring about peace without widening the war. In no
                            case will the U.S. withdraw. Less than one out of five in the U.S.
                            supports our doing less than we are now doing. Two out of three want us
                            to do more. The President's policy is that the war shall not
                            be widened; pressure shall be continued; and we seek negotiations at the
                            earliest possible moment.</p>
                        <p>All of the countries of the region agree with this policy: from Singapore
                            and Malaysia, through Laos, up to Korea. We have the support of those
                            who live there and who are in the greatest danger.</p>
                        <p>As for stopping bombing, the San Antonio formula<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">For text of the President's September 29

                                876-881.</note> is as far as we can go. We are prepared to stop
                            bombing for prompt and productive discussions, assuming that the other
                            side will not take advantage. For two months after August 25 we had a
                            300-square-mile circle around Hanoi and were in direct communication
                            with Hanoi. On September 10, we made the formula—which Hanoi
                            already knew—public, but the response was flatly
                            negative.</p>
                        <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0323"/>
                        <p>We shall stop bombing if they stop bombing with hand grenades. But we
                            cannot stop half the war. The Italian government should know that we
                            have intelligence that two North Vietnamese divisions are now moving
                            towards the South. We have stopped bombing five times, and they have
                            responded only by increasing their flow of supplies during the
                            pause.</p>
                        <p>The President does not believe that Hanoi is prepared to negotiate at

                        <p>The world press has recently focussed its attention on the
                            “scandals” that have surfaced in the Italian
                            Military Intelligence Service. This paper attempts to place the
                            imbroglio in the proper perspective.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Abstract</p>
                        <p>Since the spring of 1967, the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service
                                (<gloss target="#t_SIFAR1">SIFAR</gloss>) and its former chief,
                            General Giovanni De Lorenzo, have been publicly accused of having
                            engaged in illegal activities ranging from the unauthorized compilation
                            and pilfering of confidential personnel files to the plotting of a coup
                            d'etat in mid-1964, during a government crisis. The first
                            charge was proven correct by a government-appointed investigative
                            committee and cost General <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName> his job as Army Chief of Staff in April 1967. The
                            authenticity of the second and much more serious charge of an attempted
                            coup attributed to <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> by
                            the Italian weekly magazine L'Espresso is presently being
                            investigated by another government-appointed committee. It is also being
                            debated in court, where <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName>'s libel suit against
                            L'Espresso is now being tried. This situation gained new
                            attention early in 1968 when <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De
                                Lorenzo</persName>, or someone in his behalf, leaked so-called
                            “documentary evidence” to various rightwing
                            scandal sheets purporting to show that some key Socialists in Premier
                            Moro's present center-left coalition took payoffs from the
                            intelligence service in the early 1960's.</p>
                        <p>The furor over these charges and countercharges has added substantial
                            acceleration to the normally turbulent pre-electoral atmosphere in Italy
                            (national elections are to be held this spring). It has hardly improved
                            harmony within Premier <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s coalition government and some politicians
                            and journalists have been predicting that a government crisis would
                            result from the imbroglio. We do not believe that the revelations that
                            have surfaced thus far are sufficiently damaging to cause a government
                            crisis. If <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> were to
                            publish the mass of confidential information (real or fabricated) that
                            he has accumulated <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0325"/>on
                            practically every leading Italian personality, he could certainly
                            destroy the reputations, if not the careers, of a number of politicians.
                            It is unlikely that the government would survive such revelations. But
                            in so doing <persName corresp="#p_DLGG1">De Lorenzo</persName> would
                            also be exposing himself to prosecution. He will almost certainly not
                            take this chance.</p>

                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>1. Deputy Assistant Secretary Defense Henry Kuss and Lockheed officials
                            have had series discussions with representatives Italian industry and
                            Italian Government officials regarding proposed sale P3B
                            “Orion” aircraft to Italy. Chief of Staff Italian
                            Air Force Fanali and Chief of Staff Italian Navy Michelagnoli indicated
                            to Kuss that Italian military had just about concluded that P3B clearly
                            preferable to “Atlantique” from military point of
                            view. They expect decision on this aspect by end of August. They also
                            indicated to Kuss that political rather than military consideration
                            would determine Italian decision as between P3B and
                            “Atlantique.”</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. Kuss' discussions with industry representatives (many
                            of whom are also influential members of Christian Democratic Party) gave
                            him impression that French began to mount campaign in Italy in favor of
                            “Atlantique” immediately after Dutch decision to
                            purchase this aircraft. However, at informal meeting between Kuss and
                            Foreign Minister Medici latter did not indicate he yet aware of French
                            campaign, and showed great interest in draft memorandum Kuss and
                            Lockheed Vice President Wilder had prepared on this subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">Not found.</note>

                        <p>3. Embassy informed by reliable source that French Ambassador to Rome has
                            instructions to approach <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in effort
                            convince <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to join
                            “Atlantique” consortium and to arrange for his
                            Dutch, Belgian and German colleagues to do the same.</p>
                        <p>4. Draft memorandum prepared by Kuss and Wilder (copy left with <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> on informal basis) outlines
                            following proposal:</p>

                            interest rate, training and logistics considerations for purchase of US
                            aircraft;</p>
                        <p>(C) Expresses economic political willingness to allow equal competition
                            with US industry toward target procurement goal of 25 percent program
                            value US aircraft purchase. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.
                            Program value estimated at $100 million. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) Also expresses willingness Lockheed Aircraft
                            Corporation participate in transfer through licensing arrangements of
                            technology on compound helicopter for potential civil or military use in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>5. Kuss and Wilder prepared to sign this memorandum including 90-day
                            option on basis serious consideration by Italian Government of P3B
                            aircraft. In his informal discussion with Kuss, <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> indicated he might be prepared to
                            accept above memorandum on formal basis. Although <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> did not so indicate, Kuss was
                            informed by industry representatives that <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> will probably coordinate views of Ministries of
                            Defense, Industry and Foreign Affairs on
                            “Atlantique” consortium proposal. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> said he would let us know by July
                            27 whether <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would wish memorandum to
                            be presented formally. Memorandum could be presented either at Ministry
                            Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Defense.</p>
                        <p>6. Regardless nature <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> decision
                            regarding formal presentation of memorandum, we believe it most
                            important and urgent that letter from Chief Naval Operations to Italian
                            Chief Naval Staff and Chief of Staff Italian Air Force regarding P3B
                            purchase (delivered morning July 25) be supplemented by letters to
                            Italian Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministers from Secretaries of State
                            and Defense.</p>
                        <p>7. Following is suggested text: “The United States and Italian
                            Armed Forces have been flying anti-submarine patrols over the waters
                            surrounding Italy for many years with some of our aircraft based at the
                            same facility in Sicily. To those of us who share the responsibility for
                            defense of the Mediterranean waters your adoption of the P3B aircraft is
                            of considerable importance. We would appreciate every attention you can
                            give to this matter in the interest of our mutual
                            security.”</p>
                        <p>8. Request urgent approval of suggested letters in order that they may be
                            delivered early next week since we believe communications at <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0327"/>this level are now necessary to offset
                            expected high-level approaches from French and others in favor of

                        <p>1. I discussed our P3B proposal this morning with Minister of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> and told him <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considered this matter important and
                            hoped <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would decide to purchase this
                            aircraft. <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> told me P3B and
                            “Atlantique” proposals still under study by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and that he had no idea when decision
                            would be made.</p>
                        <p>2. During courtesy call on Minister of Industry and Commerce Andreotti
                            yesterday, I also took occasion to mention our interest in this project.
                            He seemed well aware of both our proposal and that of European
                            consortium. He, like <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName>, was
                            noncommittal regarding <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> decision on
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>3. We have taken steps to bring our interest informally to the attention

                                the P-3B aircraft to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName>. (Ibid.)</note> Subject: P-3B Sale to
                            Italy.</p>
                        <p>1. I called on Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> afternoon September 10 and discussed P-3B aircraft
                            sale along same general lines my talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>2. While a bit evasive on exact status of technical recommendations by
                            service chiefs, <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> made it clear
                            that Italian military considered P-3B and Atlantique roughly equal
                            insofar as operational effectiveness concerned. (Later discussion
                            brought out fact that Italians considered P-3B operationally superior in
                            certain respects but it had distinct disadvantage of being too heavy to
                            operate from many Italian airfields. Thus “advantages and
                            disadvantages of P-3B more or less cancelled each other
                            out.”)</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> said he had written letter
                            to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LG2">Leone</persName> requesting
                                <persName corresp="#p_LG2">Leone</persName> to convene an early
                            meeting of various Ministries concerned with this matter. In addition to
                            Defense and Foreign Affairs, he mentioned Ministries of Industry and
                            Commerce and State participation. He said he hoped decision would be
                            reached soon and indicated that a principal consideration would be
                            extent and nature of participation by Italian industry. <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> noted that there was not only the
                            important matter of probably large participation by Italian industry in
                            the Atlantique consortium, but of even more importance the possibility
                            of continued participation by Italian industry in the construction of
                            aircraft which might be developed and manufactured in the future.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> recognized the importance
                            and relevance of the political aspects of the decision and the
                            operational aspects involved in the use of the same equipment by Italy
                            and U.S. He emphasized that my call had been most timely and assured me
                            that due consideration would be given to all the arguments I put forth
                            when interministerial meeting takes place.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> told the President
                            that, while they were waiting, he had described to the Foreign Minister
                            the President's statement on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> welcomed
                            the statement and stressed his strong personal support of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He said the Italian Government before
                            Czechoslovakia had authorized signature of the treaty on August 26.
                            Czechoslovakia canceled this.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was happy to see the Foreign Minister and recalled
                            with warmth the meetings he had had with the Pope, with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName>, and former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>. He took
                            satisfaction in the close relations between Italy and the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> replied in kind.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Italians were as concerned over
                            Czechoslovakia as we were and what they planned to do about it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> said they were very much
                            concerned and were going to do all they had been asked to do. He said he
                            was going over the details of prospective Italian actions to strengthen
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on Monday. He understood that the
                            meetings in Brussels of the Permanent Representatives had gone well and
                            that the U.S. Representative had been satisfied with Italian
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>He added that after the explosion of Prague the Italian Government had
                            made a strong statement of condemnation. When he met with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, he told him that the
                            Czechoslovakian invasion contradicted the language in paragraph 12 of
                            the preamble of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.
                            (“That states must refrain in their international relations
                            from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or
                            political independence of any state.”) He told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the Russian action had
                            destroyed one of the foundations on which the treaty was based and
                            therefore had called the treaty itself into question.</p>
                        <p>Continuing on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, he said that the
                            Italians were looking to see what happens in the U.S. Senate. If they
                            see doubt arising about the treaty in the Senate, then they would have
                            doubts about the U.S. <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0330"/>interpretations of the treaty. These interpretations are essential to
                            the support the Italian Parliament has given to the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked about Rumania. He said that the situation
                            there might get out of hand. The President said he believed it was
                            serious and that was why he had made his statement of warning. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> said the statement had been
                            warmly welcomed in Italy as giving further assurance to their
                            security.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> went on to say that the
                            post-war situation represented an entire change in Western Europe. They
                            were more and more becoming tied to an open system and their prosperity
                            was dependent on trade and tourism and capital. The Italians liked
                            peace—perhaps too much.</p>
                        <p>The President said we would all have to work harder to keep the peace. He
                            felt that it was essential for U.S. troops to remain in Europe and that
                            they could remain in Europe indefinitely if the American people came to
                            believe that the Europeans were doing all they could do and should do in
                            their own defense. That was why European action was so important now.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> said he understood this
                            and fully agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how the Russians could have timed their move in
                            Czechoslovakia as badly as they did.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> answered that he believed
                            the timing was very bad and that the Russians were now worried. They
                            were pushing hard, for example, on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> but they had endangered German, Italian, Japanese and
                            other participation in the treaty, and without their participation the
                            treaty would be too weak and have too little meaning.</p>
                        <p>In closing the conversation, the President expressed again his warm
                            friendship for Italians and his hope, after he left public life, to have
                            an unhurried visit to Italy.</p>

                        <p>1. In my conversation with Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> on October 16, he raised with me the question of
                            the P3B. I said that I assumed the matter had been taken up with him in
                            Washington, and he told me that <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0331"/>neither the President nor the Secretary had mentioned it, a fact which
                            was somewhat surprising.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AHG1">Ackley</persName> recommended in
                                telegram 8742 from Rome, October 7, that the Secretary discuss the
                                matter with <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName>.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I told him I was surprised too. The Minister thought
                            he knew the explanation. Foreign Minister Debre had told him he intended
                            to protest vigorously to the United States Government the political
                            pressure which had been exerted on the Italians on behalf of the
                            “Orion”, which he thought was quite improper.
                            Debre had seen the President prior to <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName>'s call. He (<persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName>) assumes that the matter was not mentioned by the
                            President or the Secretary in response to Debre's
                            complaint.</p>
                        <p>2. He wanted to know, however, whether the United States
                            Government's interest in this matter had changed in any way.
                            I assured him that it had not. We still attached great importance to it
                            for military, economic, and political reasons. <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> said he was very happy to have
                            this assurance. He wanted to be able to say to the Prime Minister same
                            afternoon that the American Ambassador had called on him and had again
                            assured him of the American interest in this matter. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> was well aware of the second
                            supplementary U.S. proposal, and had in his hand the English version of
                            same.</p>
                        <p>3. As I left the office, Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG1">Medici</persName> expressed his hope for a favorable outcome on
                            this matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">In telegram 258677, October 21,

                        <p rend="center">FURTHER AWAY FROM MOSCOW</p>
                        <p>By supporting the Prague leadership in defiance of Soviet sensibilities,
                            the Italian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>) has
                            staked out for itself a <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0332"/>new
                            degree of autonomy. Italian Communist theory has been developing in this
                            direction—with some deviations—since 1956, when
                            party leader Togliatti first publicized his belief in “many
                                <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0333"/>roads to
                            socialism.” In previous crises in the international Communist
                            movement, however—such as when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> invaded Hungary in 1956 and supported the Arabs in the
                            Middle East crisis of 1967—the Italian Communists supported
                            the Moscow line. In the present crisis, the Italian party has shown an
                            unwonted degree of unity and has sought to develop a united front of
                            Western European Communist support for the Prague government. Over the
                            long term, Moscow may seek to oust unfriendly Italian Communist leaders
                            or to split the party if it maintains its present position. In the
                            shorter term, continuing tension between the Soviet and Italian parties
                            seems inevitable. In domestic politics, the Italian party may seek to
                            use evidence of Soviet disapproval to improve its image as an
                            independent, democratic political force respectable enough to sit with
                            the democratic parties in an Italian government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Background to Divergence</p>
                        <p>The origins of the Italian-Soviet disagreement, which has now come to an
                            open split over Czechoslovakia, go back more than a decade. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, a principal heir of the resistance
                            movement of World War II, has long been the political party in Italy
                            with the largest number of votes after the Christian Democratic Party,
                            the key member of every coalition government of the past 20 years.
                            Having achieved such success and come so close to victory through the
                            democratic political process, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>
                            has been increasingly keen to win a part in national rule.</p>
                        <p>Particularly in recent years, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has
                            been struggling to escape from the isolation it has experienced since
                            its longtime ally, the Socialist Party, became instead the ally and
                            governmental partner of the Christian Democrats. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has repeatedly sought to show that
                            Italian Communism is compatible with the democratic process either
                            because world-wide Communism is no longer antidemocratic or, if this
                            thesis is not tenable, because Italian Communism is following a
                            sufficiently different path from that of a Communist dictatorship.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Togliatti's Polycentrism</p>
                        <p>For over a decade, Italian Communist theory has been developing
                            justification for a stance more independent from the Soviet Union. The
                            Italian Communist leadership first advocated
                            “polycentrism"—a degree of autonomy for each
                            national party—in June 1956. In a published interview that
                            year, Palmiro Togliatti pointed out that “there are many
                            roads to socialism” and insisted on a system in which
                            bilateral party relationships would replace complete dependence on the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Under pressure, however, he
                            subsequently modified these views by calling for “democratic
                            centralism.” Togliatti redefined this term to involve close
                            contacts with the Soviet Union, but allowed for certain variations in
                            policy to take account of national considerations in each country.</p>
                        <p>The Italian leadership in 1964 began to re-emphasize polycentrism, and on
                            5 September published a “memorandum” by Togliatti,
                            who had just died.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">For text of
                                Togliatti's “Yalta” Memorandum, see

                                (Cambridge, 1967), pp. 373-383.</note> In this document, Togliatti
                            stressed full support for the Soviet Union in the Sino-Soviet
                            ideological conflict but said that a formal split with China must be
                            avoided. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, he said,
                            “would be against any proposal to create once again a
                            centralized international organization”; unity must be
                            achieved “in the diversity of our concrete political
                            positions” in each individual country. Togliatti emphasized
                            that the nonruling Communist parties should be more flexible and adapt
                            to local conditions. He criticized the Soviet leaders for the reluctant
                            pace of de-Stalinization and called for frequent contacts among
                            Communist parties—based on equality and not on
                            Moscow's traditional rule of
                            “unanimity” imposed from above.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Mediterranean Conference Movement</p>
                        <p>In 1967 and early 1968, the Italian Communists attempted to develop a
                            line separate from that of the Soviets by supporting a regional
                            Mediterranean conference that was to include leftist as well as
                            Communist parties. The proposal had been originated by the Yugoslav
                            Communists and a left-wing Italian Socialist splinter group.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> backed the idea of cooperating
                            with the non-Communist “progressives” in order to
                            help the party during Italy's elections in the spring of
                            1967. By establishing an identification not only with Tito but with the
                            various leftist parties in the area, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> hoped to shed its old domestic image as a tool of
                            Moscow and thereby increase its appeal to the electorate.</p>
                        <p>The idea of a Mediterranean gathering gained strength after the
                            Israeli-Arab war of June 1967. The decisive Israeli victory had stunned
                            the Arab governments and had heightened fears among local
                            “progressive” parties that the US would become
                            more involved in the area. This situation, in the words of these
                            parties, created the threat of “aggressive Atlantic-American
                            imperialism” and threatened to transform the Mediterranean
                            into a potentially explosive new “front” or
                            “scene <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0334"/>of dangerous
                            confrontation” between the US Sixth Fleet and the newly
                            introduced Soviet naval units.</p>
                        <p>After preliminary meetings in Italy and Yugoslavia, some 17 leftist and
                            Communist parties from 12 Mediterranean countries met in Rome from 9 to
                            11 April 1968, but little emerged from the secret discussions. The
                            Mediterranean movement has had little impact, and now appears to have
                            been dropped, at least temporarily.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union reportedly was consulted by the Yugoslavs on the project
                            but, as a non-Mediterranean power, probably never received an invitation
                            nor sought to send a delegation. The Soviet reaction was cool and Moscow
                            was probably put off by the Yugoslav proposal to discuss the presence of
                            Soviet naval units. In addition, the Soviets undoubtedly feared the
                            development of ideas and positions that would strengthen trends toward
                            autonomy and jeopardize their hegemony in international Communism.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Developing Soviet-Czechoslovak Crisis</p>
                        <p>The Italian Communists believed that the decentralization of the
                            international Communist movement, as exemplified in Prague's
                            experiment, was important to their domestic political success. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>, which expected to decline in
                            the national elections in May 1968, actually went up from 25.3 to 26.9
                            percent of the total vote. This success may have resulted partly from
                            the adoption by the Czechoslovak and French Communist parties of more
                            nationalistic roles.</p>
                        <p>As the Czechoslovak crisis developed, the Italian Communist leaders
                            sought both publicly and privately to dissuade the Soviets from violent
                            action. A reliable source reports “dramatic
                            clashes” during the Italian-Soviet talks in Moscow from 14 to
                            16 July. Carlo Galluzzi, the leader of the foreign affairs section of
                            the Italian party, told the Soviets that his party backed the new
                            Czechoslovak leaders. He warned that, should the Soviets intervene
                            militarily in Czechoslovakia, the Italian party would formally and
                            publicly dissociate itself from the act. After he returned, Galluzzi
                            told the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> directorate that French
                            Communist leader Waldeck Rochet, who had gone to Moscow with the
                            Italians, had taken a similar but less explicit position against Soviet
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>Publicly, too, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> sought to
                            demonstrate its support for Dubcek. The official party organ
                            L'Unita reported on 30 July that the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> believed that “frank and fraternal debates
                            and meetings” should be held in an attempt to end the
                            divergence of views over Czechoslovakia. On 6 August, a <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> communiquéexpressed
                            satisfaction that the Bratislava meeting had reaffirmed Communist
                            solidarity and collaboration “on the basis of the autonomy of

                            14 August, party secretary general Luigi Longo flew to Moscow for a
                            “brief period of repose” that presumably included
                            talks with Soviet leaders about Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Intervention</p>
                        <p>The intervention shocked the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> and came
                            as a surprise, as far as timing was concerned, even to the leaders. They
                            were widely scattered in Italy and abroad for the traditional Italian
                            August holidays. Only two <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> politburo
                            members could be found to work with lesser officials in drafting a
                            pronouncement on party reaction. The leaders decided on immediate
                            censure and issued a communiquéon 21 August after telephone
                            clearance from Longo in Moscow, but without consultation with other
                            top-ranking party members. Party leaders are reported to have commented
                            that this situation was worse than the Hungarian intervention, that it
                            upset everything the Italian Communists had done since 1945, that
                            Brezhnev and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> were
                            American agents and should be shot, and that the Soviet Union was on the
                            road to Nazism.</p>
                        <p>During the week after the intervention, all Communist federations
                            throughout Italy ratified the leadership position, according to a
                            reliable source. Below the federation level, however, local <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> leaders expressed doubt and
                            disagreement on both sides of the issue. Particularly among older
                            Communists, there was some tendency to trust the Soviets. Nevertheless,
                            the old Stalinists still prominent in the party failed to defend the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and the two most prominent
                            leaders sided unequivocally with Longo's position.
                            Middle-class Communists, intellectuals, and many younger members
                            considered the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> position too
                            bland.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Italian Support for Czechoslovakia</p>
                        <p>After the intervention, the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> made a
                            strong effort to rally international Communist opposition to the Soviet
                            action. The Italians wanted to protect the Dubcek government, if
                            possible, but in any case to distinguish the Italian Communist position
                            clearly and unmistakably from that of the Soviets. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> made a special point of working with
                            its French colleagues. Longo stopped for consultation in Paris on his
                            flight home from Moscow on 22 August, and both parties called for the
                            withdrawal of the Soviet troops. In early September, Italian Communist
                            emissaries visited Sofia and Budapest as well as Bucharest and Belgrade.
                            They held further consultations with the French and, according to
                            several reports, with other West European parties, including the
                            British, the Austrian, and the Spanish.</p>

                        <p>The Italian Communists were determined to block a world-wide Communist
                            ratification of the Soviet intervention at the international meeting
                            long scheduled to open on 25 November in Budapest. They sought to have
                            the meeting postponed indefinitely, and evidently found much sympathy
                            for this point of view at the preparatory meeting in Budapest on 30
                            September. A new preliminary session is now scheduled for 17 November
                            and, according to one source, the Soviets have moved their target date
                            for a general conference to May 1969.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Effect on Auxiliaries</p>
                        <p>The Italian reaction to the Soviet invasion has been reflected in
                            Communist auxiliary organizations as well as in party affairs. The
                            Communist-dominated Italian labor confederation, CGIL, endorsed the
                            party's condemnation of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in a commemorative issue of L'Unita one
                            month after the intervention. CGIL leaders refused a request to go to
                            Moscow for an immediate parley with the Soviets, and instead insisted on
                            consulting with Yugoslav and French labor leaders—and with
                            the Czechoslovaks—in a meeting on 30 September-1 October. In
                            addition, the Prague-based World Federation of Trade
                            Unions—apparently at the initiative of Italian and French
                            officials—condemned the Soviet invasion.</p>
                        <p>In the World Peace Council, according to a usually reliable source, the
                            French and Italian members requested a meeting of the leadership to
                            discuss the situation. The two delegations succeeded in fomenting a
                            reaction described by a Soviet official as “very
                            confused” and “very bad.”</p>
                        <p>The Italian Communist youth federation is also at odds with its Soviet
                            control elements. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> and the youth
                            federation reportedly have reached an agreement to avoid all encounters
                            with Soviet functionaries except at the highest party levels. <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> leaders may well have feared that the
                            Soviets would try, as they have in France, to persuade party elements to
                            support the Soviet position. The top levels of the Italian party are
                            also undoubtedly eager to keep lower levels of the party from making de
                            facto policy until they themselves have set over-all direction.</p>
                        <p>The secretary general of the federation evidently tried to postpone a
                            visit in late September of a Komsomol mission that the Soviets had
                            already scheduled and announced. A Soviet Embassy official refused to
                            discuss the question with the Italians, however, insisting that the
                            Komsomol group was coming anyway.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Repercussions and Prospects</p>
                        <p>The Italian party's stand against Soviet intervention in
                            Czechoslovakia represents a new degree of autonomy from the Soviets. The
                                <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0337"/>party's position
                            is, in fact, an outright rejection of Soviet leadership of the world
                            Communist movement, even if the Italian comrades continue to say polite
                            things about the importance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            in that movement. The Italian party under its present leadership is
                            unlikely to return to the relationship it had with the Soviet party
                            before August. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> has been
                            unequivocal and persistent in criticizing the Soviet intervention in
                            Czechoslovakia. It was in the forefront of efforts to strengthen
                            opposition to the Soviets in Communist parties throughout the free
                            world. Moreover, although some low-level Italian Communists still think
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is infallible, the Italian
                            Communist leadership has given every sign of an unusual degree of
                            cohesion, and Luigi Longo's position as top leader seems
                            enhanced.</p>
                        <p>In trying to bring the Italian Communists into line, the Soviets have two
                            principal weapons, a threat to cut off financial aid and a threat to
                            read the Italian party out of the Communist brotherhood. Some sources
                            have suggested that the Soviets will first choose to cut off the flow of
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>After the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> had disapproved of the
                            Soviet march into Czechoslovakia, Amerigo Terenzi, director of the party
                            press and apparently the agent for Soviet press subsidies, remarked to
                            the director of the influential Paese Sera that in two or three months
                            the paper might have to close, according to a reliable source. Terenzi
                            added that, as things were going, it was practically certain there would
                            be no more money. As yet, however, there is no evidence that Moscow has
                            cut its financing.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviets have long provided the Italian Communist Party with
                            substantial financial support, it is not clear how essential Soviet aid
                            is to maintaining the size and strength of the party. In 1956, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> contributed about $7.5 million
                            to a party budget of just over $11 million, according to a reliable
                            source. Since then, however, the Soviet subsidy has probably decreased
                            markedly, but the Soviets undoubtedly continue to provide additional
                            funds for special occasions such as election campaigns.</p>
                        <p>Soviet financial pressure on the Italian Communist Party may also take
                            the form of curtailing trade through Communist-influenced Italian
                            commercial operations, which have customarily given a substantial cut to
                            the party. The party could perhaps make up part of any shortfall in
                            Soviet funding by seeking increased contributions from private Italian
                            industry. Italian industrialists have long opposed putting all their
                            eggs in one basket and, as a matter of policy, contribute to all
                            political groups with major potential. Italy's industry has
                            thus contributed substantially to the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> over many years to provide itself with a friend at
                            court if the <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss> achieves its ambition
                            of entering a government coalition. The <gloss target="#t_PCI1">PCI</gloss>'s success on a local government level and in
                            the labor movement has also provided industry with reasons to
                            contribute.</p>
                        <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0338"/>
                        <p>If the split widens between the Soviet and Italian parties, the Soviets
                            may seek to emphasize throughout the world Communist movement that the
                            Italians have deviated from the true Marxist line. Such an indictment
                            would be damaging to the Italian Communist sense of belonging to a world
                            movement, a sense that has been part of their appeal. Even in this
                            event, however, the Italian party is not likely to view itself as having
                            taken a unique stand on Marxist doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Over the long term, if there were no alternative, the Soviets could
                            undoubtedly split the Italian Communist Party and could then provide
                            support to a faction accepting Moscow's dominance. Any such
                            faction, however, probably would draw only a small percentage of present
                            Italian Communist strength. In any case, the Soviets would probably make
                            a strong effort first to secure more friendly Italian party leadership
                            by bringing pressure for the ouster of some leaders and by attempting to
                            show others—through fear or favor—the practicality
                            of a pro-Soviet stance. The most likely immediate outlook therefore, is
                            for continuing tension between the two parties.</p>
                        <p>In domestic politics, the Italian party will seek to use its disagreement
                            with the Soviets to further its contention that it is not a
                            “tool of Moscow.” The party must avoid such a
                            stigma if it is to make further progress toward its most ardently sought
                            domestic objective—developing cooperation with left-wing
                            Christian Democrats and Socialists to the point where the Communists
                            will be accepted as partners in a government coalition.</p>

                            area, Secretary stated hope <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> in next
                            months could cooperate in measures which would improve atmosphere in
                            which new Congress would consider trade measures. Specifically suggested

                        <p>4. In reply Colombo expressed appreciation U.S. efforts in resisting
                            protectionism. Stated <gloss target="#t_ASP1">ASP</gloss> was linked
                            with acceleration <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> at French
                            insistence. Italy's basic idea <gloss target="#t_KR1">KR</gloss> acceleration is good-will gesture which ought to be
                            reciprocated by some motion on U.S. side toward <gloss target="#t_ASP1">ASP</gloss> passage.</p>
                        <p>5. On proposed commercial arrangements with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Colombo stated personal opinion any arrangement for
                            trade preferences should be tied with specific objective for achieving
                            economic integration. Italy and Netherlands feel strongest about this.
                            Germany not as staunch as before and Colombo hoped Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> in visit to Bonn could help to
                            firm up German position. Colombo said 1969 will be critical year for
                                <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>. He personally feels <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> costs too much, creates agricultural
                            surpluses and favors status quo rather than progress. In his opinion,
                            export differential payments should be narrowed while expenditures for
                            agricultural productivity improvement should be increased. Finance
                            Minister Strauss agrees with this. But not clear that Italian or German
                            Government as a whole does.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On December 12 Mr. Phil Sullivan and Mr. James Gannett of Lockheed
                            Aircraft Corporation came in to discuss the possibility that there might
                            still be hope that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would reverse
                            its field and buy the P3B. They had information from their
                            representative in Rome that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            might not yet have formally committed itself in writing to the Breguet
                            Atlantique; also there was a possibility that some members of the new
                            government might be friendly to the P3B. They said they had called at
                            the Pentagon and been informed that while <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was not prepared to take the initiative in offering its
                            proposal again, it would have no objection to informing the Embassy in
                            Rome that the offer was still valid, in the event a question were asked
                            from the Italian side. In response <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0341"/>I told Messrs. Sullivan and Gannett that we did not
                            know whether the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had signed a
                            commitment on the Atlantique, but that it was not likely that we would
                            be informed in any event; we would be prepared to ask the Embassy if it
                            had any information on the general subject, but would check first with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I subsequently spoke to Olney in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/ILN
                            who had seen Sullivan and Gannett several days earlier. He said he felt
                            that there was no change whatsoever of an Italian switch and that the
                            straws held out by the Lockheed representative in Rome were very thin
                            indeed. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> did not want to associate
                            itself with a further offer on the basis of such flimsy evidence, and
                            did not even want to send a contingency “if asked”
                            message to the Embassy. On the other hand Olney told the Lockheed
                            officials that if the Italians were to approach them on the P3B, the
                            Pentagon would stand behind the P3B package.</p>
                        <p>During a conversation with Bob Gordon in Rome on December 13, I mentioned
                            the Lockheed call the previous day. He said there had been a few rumors
                            floating on the subject, but they all could be traced back to one
                            source, the Lockheed man in Rome. If there were anything substantial,
                            the Embassy would certainly report it, but this was definitely not the
                            case. A month ago, <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Gui</persName> had sent a letter of intent on
                            the Atlantique to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consortium
                            group, but whether this constituted a binding commitment was not
                            clear.</p>

                                1964.</note> Foreign Minister said he would give arguments serious
                            consideration but reiterated his personal belief no dramatic move at
                            this time would be helpful to Portugal. This I countered with forceful
                            statement immediate future time for action more than any other of which
                            I could conceive. Foreign Minister [said] <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> public announcement and reason for not accepting
                            Portuguese invitation came as complete surprise, although they did not
                            expect him to accept.</p>
                        <p>Second subject, related to foregoing, was Portuguese image and necessity
                            to project to world current progressive measures being taken in
                            Portuguese Africa together with reforms which have been and are being
                            made. This led to importance avoid antagonizing friendly elements by
                            such actions as totally unjustified wave of critical editorials and
                            anti-American attitude manifested in radio and TV. I mentioned harmful
                            effect on Portuguese image by their actions re Protestant missionaries
                            in Africa, pointing out that vast majority these people engaged in

                            These missionaries should not be penalized nor their supporting groups
                            alienated because of possible irritation Portuguese authorities with
                            indiscreet actions of a few. No comment by Foreign Minister.</p>

                            position to judge. However, he did say he fully understood American
                            feelings. He stated Portugal had de facto arrangement on Macau but
                            necessarily had to consider longer range problem Macau as well as
                            long-range commercial interests. He stated matter under consideration as

                            nor was for purpose of irritating or alienating US. He stated quite

                        <p>Dear George:</p>
                        <p>I greatly appreciated your letter of January 28, 1964, enclosing the
                            report of your recent conversation with the Foreign Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See <ref target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am delighted to hear that you are contemplating a trip to the
                            Portuguese areas of Africa. I definitely concur in such a visit and look
                            forward to receiving from you a first-hand report of your impressions of
                            these areas.</p>
                        <p>I note that you intend to take one of your Attachés along with
                            you on the trip. In the interest of broadening the knowledge within the
                            Embassy of these territories, I believe it would be advantageous for you
                            also to take along with you one of the officers from your political
                            section. I believe that you would find such an officer of great value to
                            you on your trip as well as after you return.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the days since the trip to Lisbon last August and

                            US believes change fact of life in our era. Changes in Portuguese Africa
                            as inevitable as elsewhere in world, though Portugal still has power to

                            Africans will result in changes detrimental to interests of United
                            States and West as well as to Portugal. This is why US continually urges

                            will take place in her territories and, being based on pragmatic
                            principles, it is why US policies in respect this situation have not

                            by me both forcefully and comprehensively. In strongest terms I urged
                            Salazar produce public statement accepting reasonable concept of
                            self-determination on basis of which extreme African pressures could be
                            relieved, Portuguese image could be improved, and Portugal's
                            friends could rally in support of orderly, phased, peaceful solution to
                            problem of general concern to us all.</p>
                        <p>Regret I must report that <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>
                            remained adamantly opposed any public statement on self-determination.
                            He adduced familiar case of Belgian Congo and said with entire weight of
                            evidence against <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0349"/>prospects any
                            orderly transition he could not understand why <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> insisted upon trying invent yet one more formula. I
                            told him we did so precisely to avoid repeating errors of past.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> said that while
                            Nationalist pressures of today are from outside Angola and Mozambique
                            they would promptly develop internally if <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> were to make public utterance of type we sought press
                            upon it.</p>
                        <p>To my suggestion that Angolan refugees with exception known criminals be
                            welcomed back into that province, Salazar replied that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> quite willing accept them and even
                            Congo Leopoldville probably quite glad be relieved of them, but that
                            armed forces of Holden Roberto physically prevented their return except
                            for small groups which manage straggle across frontier and reach
                            Portuguese reception stations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> readily agreed with my
                            assertion need for massive investment to develop material and human
                            resources Portuguese Africa. Cited drain imposed on Portuguese
                            development funds and capabilities by present military situation as
                            basis for view political solution must precede economic. As regards
                            specifically private investment, I mentioned need for political
                            stability as one essential ingredient in favorable investment climate.
                            He responded by comparing stability offered by Portuguese administration
                            in Africa with that offered by newly-independent African states.
                            Enlarging upon this, Salazar said he did not know about US but that
                            private investors from European countries seemed willing invest in
                            Portuguese Africa and were still doing so at present time. To him this
                            suggested that they found business conditions more promising there than
                            in independent Africa and that they did not attach too great importance
                            to terrorism in Northern Angola.</p>
                        <p>Only point upon which <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>
                            readily fell in with our thinking had to do with continued Luso-African
                            conversations. He professed see these as unproductive due to fact
                            participants operating on entirely different wave lengths but smilingly
                            expressed his willingness carry them on if we felt this advisable.</p>
                        <p>On balance I could perceive no real give or hint of prospective change in
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s
                            position. He made clear and explicit his belief that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> efforts are misdirected and that
                            morally and realistically we should be pressing African states to
                            withdraw support from terrorists who impede political, economic and
                            social evolution of Portuguese Africa rather than pressuring Portugal to
                            take steps which could only lead to instability and retrogression.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> remained personally
                            friendly throughout entire discussion and at its conclusion thanked me
                            for report upon my African travels. Again I was amazed at the amount of
                            detailed knowledge he has over an area which he has never visited.</p>

                            Minister, I believe it might be very helpful were you personally to

                                “self-determination” for the African colonies.
                                (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 10 PORT)</note> convince
                            me that neither is at this time willing consider any public statement on
                            self-determination of type we have been recommending. I am personally
                            highly dubious as to merit or net advantage to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of continuing to hammer away at theme at once
                            unacceptable and unpalatable to <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>.
                            Apart from being unproductive, such continuing effort progressively
                            erodes our good will credit and our ability influence Portuguese on
                            other matters of importance to us. We are already, I believe,
                            undesirably far out in front of practically all other countries in this
                            regard. While we continue press and irritate Portuguese on matter of
                            Africa and self-determination, other nations through more passive role
                            are picking up points and advantages in other areas.</p>
                        <p>I therefore suggest as means moving this problem off dead center and for
                            purpose introducing new element flexibility that, in your conversation
                            with Foreign Minister at The Hague, you probe <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position in following manner. After making reference
                            our continuing but as yet unfruitful effort elicit <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> public statement on self-determination
                            and reasons why US believes such statement would be helpful to <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position, inquire of Foreign Minister
                            as to what if any action, assurances, or guarantee of support on part of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would persuade <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> issue such statement. You could
                            indicate our familiarity with standard <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> arguments but also make reference again to frequently
                            expressed belief by <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that we are in
                            position materially influence course of events in Africa. While
                            reiterating view that US influence significantly overrated, you could
                            conclude that US willingness attempt find peaceful resolution of
                            problems besetting our allies can stand, and has stood, <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0353"/>severe tests and we quite prepared
                            place our prestige along side Portuguese on a specific and defensible
                            proposal if this will move issue forward. Foreign Minister would then
                            specifically be asked whether any action or guarantee of support on our
                            part could induce <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> come forth with

                            more fruitful avenue of discussion (which I doubt) or provide clear
                            evidence no useful purpose served by continuing present tactics until

                        <p>Calling at his request, the Ambassador first asked the Secretary whether
                            there had been any developments stemming from the dossier that the
                            Portuguese Foreign Minister had sent to us earlier as evidence of the
                            dependency of the Angolan rebellion on Congolese support.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Not further identified.</note> The Secretary
                            replied that we have tried to get the Congolese to take a responsible
                            and moderate approach to this problem and have cautioned against dangers
                            inherent in lending aid and comfort to the movement. Now the Congolese
                            political situation is in a state of flux, and it is difficult to
                            predict what kind of government will emerge. The Secretary believed,
                            however, that there are elements among the Congolese who wish to
                            cooperate in finding a peaceful solution for problems involving Angola
                            and the Congo. Until the political picture in the Congo is clarified, we
                            can only remain on the watch to see how the situation evolves. The
                            Secretary asked if the Ambassador had any new information.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador launched upon familiar Portuguese themes. He said that
                            although there has been a decrease in terrorist activities in Angola,
                            where the situation is now relatively calm and peaceful, nevertheless,
                            the Portuguese continue to receive reports of large shipments of arms
                            coming from a variety of Communist countries and entering the Congo for
                            the use of Holden Roberto rather than the Congolese themselves. Thus
                            while the Portuguese are not worried by the present situation in Angola
                            itself, they are very concerned for the future because of the gathering
                            military strength of the Angolan rebels and the use of Congolese
                            territory as a safehaven in launching attacks against Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then proceeded to paint a very rosy picture of conditions
                            in Angola, based on what he said was his firsthand observations made on
                            his trip there in January. Describing Angola as an island of peace and
                            contentment in a sea of African turmoil, he said that the entire
                            population is benefitting from the many social and health benefits, that
                            economic conditions are good, that racial integration is complete and
                            that slow but steady progress is being made toward greater political
                            freedom with elections now at a district level. The only threat to this
                            favorable evolution is the non-nationalist, Communist-backed rebel
                            movement. If the use of the Congo for this operation could be
                            terminated, the Ambassador was convinced that all of Angola's
                            troubles would be quickly over. The Ambassador, therefore, urged U.S.
                            support for obtaining this objective, including some public
                            acknowledgment on our part of the positive developments taking place in
                            Angola, such as the role of Angolan transportation facilities in helping
                            bolster the Congo economy.</p>
                        <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that perhaps the Ambassador was underestimating
                            the importance of the political factor in the Angolan domestic scene. In
                            this day and age, favorable social and economic conditions do not
                            necessarily alone satisfy populations, which are now insisting upon the
                            right of governing or even misgoverning themselves. The Secretary
                            wondered, therefore, whether the Portuguese should not try to cope with
                            the rebellion using political and negotiating methods rather than
                            relying entirely upon force. Referring to the fact that he had told the
                            Portuguese Foreign Minister on a previous occasion that the Spanish
                            approach to their African problems seemed to have succeeded in muffling
                            attacks by Afro-Asians against Spain, the Secretary thought that
                            Portugal might profit from this example.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">Not
                                further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued to insist that there would be no problem if the
                            Congo ceased to be a base of operation against Angola, that the
                            Afro-Asians refuse to accept evidence of the good conditions and
                            contentment prevailing in Angola, as exemplified by the refusal of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General to visit Angola,
                            and finally that Spaniards do not have the same large interests and
                            investments in their African territories that the Portuguese have.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked the Secretary for his appraisal of recent
                            political developments in the Congo, including the unexpected return of
                            Tshombe to Leopoldville. He said that these events had generated all
                            kinds of rumors, such as one that he had heard to the effect that the
                            United States had backed Tshombe's return to the Congo on the
                            condition that Tshombe would continue to support Holden Roberto. The
                            Ambassador said that this no doubt was just a silly story, but he wished
                            to cite it as an example of what people are talking about.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary dismissed the story as obviously without foundation,
                            pointing out that the United States is not particularly in
                            Tshombe's good graces because of past events and emphasizing
                            that in any case, the United States had nothing to do with
                            Tshombe's return to Leopoldville, a strictly Congolese
                            affair. As for the general political situation in the Congo, it is
                            presently so unsettled that neither we nor anybody else is in a position
                            to predict the outcome. Perhaps a government of national reconciliation
                            would emerge headed up by Adoula, or even Tshombe, but at this point, we
                            just cannot say.</p>
                        <p>After expressing concern about trends in Algeria, the Ambassador said as
                            a final point, he wished to ask how we regarded the current Zanzibar
                            situation, which continues to worry the Portuguese because of reports
                            that the Communist presence is still strong there. In this connection,
                            he commented that while not a shot has been fired in Mozambique, <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0357"/>nevertheless, the Portuguese
                            know that so-called “freedom fighters” are being
                            trained in Tanganyika to cause the same type of trouble and violence
                            that has occurred in Angola as a result of Roberto's
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the Zanzibar situation seems now to be
                            developing in a somewhat more favorable direction, that the former
                            Embassies on the island, including the East German and ChiCom posts,
                            have been reduced to Consulates, with the West Germans, however,
                            retaining their Embassy in Tanganyika. Furthermore, the Tanganyikan
                            police seem to have the internal security of the island well in
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thanked the Secretary for his kind reception and hoped
                            that perhaps after the situation in the Congo had clarified, he could
                            again seek our views on problems in the area.</p>

                            non-controversial atmosphere from which following emerged:</p>
                        <p>1. Conversation general in nature and did not touch upon specific issues
                            such as US attitude toward Holden Roberto and other nationalists, Loran
                            C, Azores etc. In addition to African discussion, in which <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> showed greatest interest,
                            Secretary gave brief rundown on inconclusive <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> talks, ChiCom problem, Article 19 and prospects

                        <p>2. Although situation in Portuguese Africa now calm and no cause for
                            special concern, nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> much worried about

                        <p>3. African radicals wish subvert Congo as strategic heart of Africa and
                            are now claiming right of intervention there, supported by arms

                            troops kept longer. Secretary explained military limitations curtailed
                            further use of operation.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> claimed recent African
                            developments offer further evidence of correctness of Portuguese African
                            policies and <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> cannot understand US
                            efforts to modify them which can only lead to new Congo situations.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> agreed with Secretary

                            France seem to be taking decreased interest in African problems and

                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> not expecting much

                        <p>671. Greatly appreciate your 652<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">Dated April
                                13. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> PORT)</note> as
                            means break stalemate in this long-standing and grave issue. It has
                            evoked wide interest here and in African posts whose views have been
                            solicited and which you have seen.</p>
                        <p>We are only too well aware of difficulties you would have in selling
                            proposal to Portuguese and appreciate need for positive elements from
                            their viewpoint if they are to give serious consideration to such
                            proposal. At same time we are concerned about such aspects as extent of
                            US involvement, length of transitional period, need for political
                            activity prior to plebiscite, and role for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>. We have
                            modified your proposal on these points and have elaborated several
                            others and following is outline of our thinking for an approach to
                            Portuguese.</p>
                        <p>1. We believe present juncture when Portuguese are in relatively strong
                            position in both Angola and Mozambique presents opportunity for <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and Africans to reach agreement for
                            peaceful resolution their differences. Key elements of solution would
                            have to be transition period leading to self-determination and cessation
                            of nationalist-inspired violence and subversion, as well as inspiration
                            and support for such actions by African governments concerned. Full
                            range of choice would be left to people, and would include maintenance
                            of present relationship with Portugal, autonomy within Commonwealth, or
                            full independence. Aim of proposal would be peaceful transition and
                            creation stable society no matter what political decisions are made by
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>2. Specifically Portugal would propose eight-year transition period
                            leading to free and open plebiscite observed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> representatives.
                                (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We propose eight years, given
                            comments from African posts that five may be realistic limit negotiable
                            with Africans, but this of course is matter for negotiating parties to
                            determine. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.) In return
                            neighboring African states would pledge assurances they would not allow
                            subversive elements to organize or operate from their territories
                            against Portuguese territories for purposes of infiltration, subversion
                            or attack across international frontiers, and that they will not allow
                            arms to flow across their territories to such elements. All <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0363"/>training camps for nationalist military
                            or para-military training would be disbanded.</p>
                        <p>3. US and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would
                            encourage Africans' acceptance and urge fulfillment terms of
                            such an agreement, would publicly come out in full support of agreement
                            once it is adopted and would publicly condemn any violation of terms
                            should such occur subsequently from any quarter. We would
                            sympathetically consider Portuguese request for support for Portuguese
                            complaint in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if we were satisfied
                            deliberate and organized violations had taken place, and under same
                            circumstances would be responsive to <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            requests for arms purchases. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. By
                            same token if Portugal welched on plebiscite, we would consider
                            sympathetically African requests for support. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. We recognize that Guinea and Congo (Brazzaville) are not likely to
                            accept proposal and would probably continue support of violence against
                            Portuguese Guinea and Cabinda. If agreement were reached and in force
                            with others, we would in this event publicly condemn such actions. We
                            would make other African governments aware of our position on this
                            aspect from the outset.</p>
                        <p>5. During transition period US would itself provide and would encourage
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies to provide, if
                            Portugal so requests, economic and technical support for Portuguese
                            efforts to develop African territories. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and its specialized agencies would be allowed to observe
                            and report on developments and provide assistance. <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> members would also be invited to
                            provide economic and technical assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. Increasingly free political activity would obviously have to be
                            permitted to make for meaningful plebiscite. Full amnesty and
                            repatriation would also be allowed for refugees and, as time for
                            plebiscite approached, for nationalist leaders, who must be permitted to
                            campaign openly and freely for independence if they choose to do so.</p>
                        <p>7. We would hope that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, if interested
                            in such proposal, would in time present it to African leaders and
                            thereby initiate dialogue which might result in meaningful negotiations.
                            Should Portugal desire, we would be quite willing to assist by sounding
                            out such leaders and <persName corresp="#p_TU1">U Thant</persName> on a
                            tentative basis and in manner designed to pave way for direct
                            Portuguese-African discussions.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate your comments on foregoing draft presentation and on
                            timing of any approach.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">The Embassy

                            reviewed gamut of US-Portuguese problems. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> reiterated all too familiar complaints about US
                            policy in Africa well as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            shortcomings in failing recognize defense problems all of Portuguese
                            nation, i.e. Portuguese Africa. Referring to current satisfactory
                            security conditions in Angola and Mozambique and increased willingness
                            African moderates stand up to radicals, Nogueira said these gains offset
                            by continuing Communist subversion and arms shipments to Africa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then embarked upon recitation
                            of bill of tendentious particulars as evidence US is
                            “hostilizing” Portugal in Africa while requesting
                            Portugal to grant base and other facilities in Atlantic area. Portuguese
                            complaints, some of which new, centered around familiar
                            themes—alleged US aid to nationalists, especially Holden
                            Roberto; restrictions on US arms sales and discouragement of foreign
                            suppliers, thus hampering Portuguese struggle against Communism in
                            Africa; and unfriendly remarks allegedly made by American officials in
                            running down Portuguese African policy and even criticizing Africans
                            showing some understanding for it. Under such circumstances how, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> asked, would aroused Portuguese
                            public opinion agree to <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> negotiations
                            on Cape Verde tracking station, Loran C sites and Azores base? He
                            thought some US clarification or explanation would be useful in
                            smoothing off present rough edges in US-Portuguese relations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said we would look into complaints but we would also like to

                            suggestion that Portugal, which admittedly had done much to build up
                            African territories while rejecting racism, attempt to improve its
                            public stance by indicating greater willingness be guided by will of the

                            which, in Secretary's words, Portugal's
                            “over sensitive antennae,” have picked up. We will

                            US. He was relaxed and extremely cordial and felt he had <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0366"/>fine visit. He recognized

                            expressed regret not able see President, but said he understood.

                            on Brazilian portion his trip but not then on visit to US.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> described his three-hour
                            conversation with Secretary as friendly and said he was obliged make
                            complaints he did in order be sure brought to Secretary's
                            attention. Grateful that complaints “will be
                            investigated.” He expressed regret he left impression Loran-C
                            and Azores base negotiations are linked to solution Portuguese problem
                            in Africa. He had considered asking for another brief period with
                            Secretary to clarify this impression indicating to me that other
                            “quid pro quo” perhaps feasible.</p>
                        <p>With respect Loran-C I told <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> I
                            disappointed they had not come to grips this important problem during
                            conversations. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he could
                            not say now how we should proceed on Loran-C and would talk to me after
                            reporting to Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to him that another question raised during conversation was
                            not answered, the Secretary's request that Portugal give its
                            friends “a flag to rally around.” While Portuguese
                            position in Africa relatively strong now, I suggested <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> consider best way cope with situation
                            in terms of 15 or 20 years. If Portugal could show some flexibility we
                            might be able help out. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said
                            he would keep these considerations in mind and talk about subject after
                            seeing Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>He repeated old complaints about United Nations, stressing unfriendly
                            make-up of Secretariat which is dominated by Indians and Communist Bloc
                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>After this discussion with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> I am
                            somewhat less pessimistic possibilities our doing business with <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> on matters essential to US.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s reply to my
                            restatement of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> interest in Azores
                            base agreement and Loran-C facilities is reported separately but
                            essentially left status these matters unchanged for the present.</p>
                        <p>Finally and using approach suggested <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>-2167, I broached proposal for peaceful solution Portuguese
                            territories problem. I prefaced this by emphasizing to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> in highly personal manner that
                            proposal being offered in spirit of friendship and sincerity and should
                            not be misconstrued as attempt to “buy” Portuguese
                            Africa or in fact to displace Portuguese interests, influence or
                            presence there. We were in fact suggesting “flag which they
                            themselves could raise and about which their friends and moderate
                            Africans could rally.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> listened attentively and with
                            evident and increasing interest. He also took notes which I have never
                            seen him do before. From his facial expression I gathered that most
                            elements in package made considerable impression on him.</p>
                        <p>Upon conclusion my presentation <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            said that he obviously could not comment immediately and officially upon
                            proposal of such scope. Said that it would require personal
                            consideration by <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> and <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0368"/>other members of govt. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> did single out as elements of
                            difficulty the role of political parties during interim period, problem
                            of political campaigns, coverage of amnesty and repatriation
                            arrangements, and identity and character of what I had mentioned as
                            “international observers” at plebiscite. I was
                            encouraged, however, by fact he did not reject my suggestion these be
                            considered implementation details to be worked out only after decision
                            taken as to acceptability of proposal in principle and broad outline.
                            FonMin promised bring proposal <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s attention and I indicated
                            expectation I would subsequently request appointment discuss it further
                            with both of them.</p>
                        <p>Believe time now appropriate for Dept call in and discuss with <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName>. Strongly recommend, however,
                            effort be concentrated on emphasizing broad outline and to de-emphasize
                            features difficult for <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> until latter
                            has had time absorb over-all concept and gain some appreciation
                            potential advantages vis-à-vis continuation present course of
                            action. If proposal conceivably can get away from starting wire I am
                            confident prospects will thereafter be better for negotiating on
                            specific identity of “observers” and other such
                            sticky items. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> did state very
                            positive belief <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that
                            “time on their side” and internal situations
                            Angola and Mozambique “solid.” I must also caution
                            against any over-optimism that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> can be persuaded to alter the firm convictions
                            which all available evidence points that he continues to hold. As final
                            thought and one I consider essential safeguard, I strongly recommend
                            absolutely no mention of proposal be made any other nation without our
                            so informing <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> in advance.</p>

                            small minority of hard-core terrorists would not be acceptable and that
                            U.S. refugee program frustrates their efforts by creating

                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, aside from ideological
                            differences, were until 1961, “friends without difficulties,
                            now we are friends with difficulties.” <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> recalled that in 1961 <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Angola debate, <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0370"/><note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Apparent

                                establishing a program for assistance to refugees from

                            unlike <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France, who abstained,
                            voted against Portugal. This act regarded as great blow in Portugal and
                            as giving radical Africans and terrorists green light. Said Portuguese,
                            who at great risk had given US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            Azores facilities during war, thus exposing themselves to German
                            retaliations (bombing of Lisbon, for example), were stunned by US
                            suddenly turning against them.</p>
                        <p>C. Leddy reaffirmed US interest in Azores and Loran-C, stating we had
                            done our best track down and investigate all of <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s complaints which
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said made it difficult for
                            him reconcile with our requests. <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> replied seemed obvious that by granting these
                            increased facilities Portugal increased its vulnerability to Soviet
                            attack. Difficult for <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> justify to
                            Portuguese public that it would agree greater defense facilities of its
                            allies without improving Portuguese defense facilities and by this
                                <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> said, must understand
                            that defense of Portugal means all of Portugal, including Angola and
                            Mozambique and other overseas territories. Without changing our
                            countries' basic policies (i.e. for U.S.—policy on
                            arms and self-determination), <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> said, some way must be found help Portugal improve
                            defense its territories by offering Portugal
                            “counterparts.” <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> observed this sounded like very difficult task and
                            pointed out Loran-C may increase Portuguese vulnerability but at same
                            time greatly improved defense posture of all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, including Portugal. Garin agreed but indicated
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> did not believe this was
                            sufficient inducement for <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> agree and
                            emphasized some ways and means must be found so that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> can justify to Portuguese public
                            opinion that Portuguese security would be additionally improved and this
                            security must include territories.</p>
                        <p>D. Leddy outlined proposal made by Anderson to Foreign Minister,
                            September 2,<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">See <ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>.</note> saying US advancing plan as possible

                            Portuguese African problem. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>
                            said Anderson asked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> consider
                            Portugal publicly accepting principle self-determination for African
                            territories on basis definite timetable. In exchange, Africans would
                            agree suspension all anti-Portuguese activities. US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would publicly support plan.
                            US would be responsive Portuguese request for arms if we satisfied
                            deliberate and organized violations had taken place and would be

                            through dialogue between Portuguese and Africans.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> said his reply not represent
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> response to proposal but
                            reflected what he thought reaction in Lisbon would be as <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> had probably already indicated to
                            Anderson, to wit:</p>
                        <p>1. Based on <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> experience with Africans
                            at aborted 1963 talks at New York,<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">Reference
                                is to informal talks held during the 1963 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly debate on Angola.</note> Africans
                            only interested in self-determination which leads to independence.
                            Africans rejected Portuguese offer of plebiscite—Africans
                            would not accept plebiscite which resulted in anything but
                            independence—difficult for Africans retreat from this
                            position to open choice now proposed.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> concerned that once it agreed
                            plebiscite, it would be confronted with difficult conditions under which
                            it would be held, such as withdrawal Portuguese troops and entry all
                            kinds of undesirables, “Ghanaians, etc.” <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> fears that with such conditions
                            imposed, Angola would go down the drain in eight days, like Congo.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> not against self-determination
                            and, in fact, is practicing it in territories where all inhabitants have
                            full rights of citizens. Admitted condition of one man, one vote not yet
                            achieved but this also true elsewhere in world. However, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> moving in that direction.</p>
                        <p>4. On whole, Portugal believes its position in Africa steadily growing
                            stronger, therefore, it would hesitate voluntarily weaken its position
                            through some political action such as contained in latest <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposal.</p>

                        <p>My dear George:</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that during our conversation on September 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">See <ref target="#d163">Document
                                163</ref>.</note> the Ambassador outlined to me the terms of a
                            proposal related to the Portuguese Overseas in which, among other
                            aspects, the possibility of a plebiscite was mentioned. It will also be
                            remembered that for my part, when I commented then on the idea, I said
                            that from the Afro-Asian point of view a plebiscite would only be valid
                            and acceptable if Portugal were to satisfy the following conditions:
                            withdrawal of all the armed and police forces whose presence in the
                            territories would certainly be taken as an obstacle to the freedom of
                            the voter; authorization for the entry into the territories of those
                            whom the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Africans might
                            consider to be the “chiefs” who represent the
                            populations, and therefore a prior amnesty would be required; and
                            lastly, since the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> requires a
                            “democratic process”, political debate would have
                            to be permitted and even stimulated, and in this matter there would be
                            imposed a complete freedom of political parties, headed by the
                            “chiefs” referred to above, and inspired by any
                            and all foreign governments.</p>
                        <p>I recall the preceding because the Senegalese delegation at the last
                            conference of Plenipotentiaries of the International Telecommunications
                            Union, which took place in Montreaux,<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">September 14-November 12, 1965.</note> presented a resolution on
                            the 15th of this month in which it practically repeated what I had said
                            in our conversation on the 2nd. I enclose a copy of the pertinent
                            passages containing the “conditions” which Senegal
                            wishes Portugal to obey.</p>
                        <p>The coincidence is revealing and very significant, and full of
                            implications.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said
                            that he wished to bring up the problem of the B-26's which
                            Portugal had acquired. This matter had recently been under discussion in
                            Lisbon and Washington.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">No record of the
                                discussion was found.</note> He asked <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0374"/>if the Secretary knew of these discussions, and the
                            Secretary acknowledged that he did. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> remarked that it appeared that there was a
                            violation of U.S. laws in connection with the seven B-26's
                            which finally landed in Portugal not long ago. The Secretary was kind
                            enough to send a message via Ambassador Anderson on the subject. An
                            investigation was at once carried out, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said, as the Secretary may be aware.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> pointed out that he would
                            like to repeat what he said to Ambassador Anderson in Lisbon.<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">Not further identified.</note> Portugal made the
                            agreement to purchase the B-26's from a European firm which
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had every reason to believe was
                            bona fide. The firm had headquarters in Switzerland, owned its own
                            airport and dispatched a representative with proper credentials. The
                            purchase contract was negotiated without any knowledge of the
                            involvement of any other firms. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said that he himself had seen the contract and
                            given a copy to Ambassador Anderson. As a result of the Portuguese
                            investigation it has been discovered that the Swiss firm seems to have
                            cooperated with a Canadian firm which in turn had dealt with an American
                            firm (Hamilton Aircraft).</p>
                        <p>Portugal has a clear conscience in this matter, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said. The contract was
                            negotiated in the same way that such contracts are always negotiated and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was unaware that any U.S. laws
                            were being violated. Portugal paid hard cash for the aircraft and did
                            not know the planes were supposed to fly from the U.S. The investigation
                            has not revealed whether the planes were the property of the U.S.
                            Government or whether they were surplus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that this made no difference, as in any event
                            there had been a violation of the Munitions Export Control Act. The
                            Secretary said he was no lawyer and would have to get further details on
                            the legal questions involved. However, one of the firms involved is in
                            serious violation of U.S. law and Portugal is in a position of a country
                            which had received stolen property, whether or not they knew they were
                            doing so.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said this was not quite
                            the case, since Portugal had paid for the aircraft and paid a man who
                            was not a thief. Hamilton Aircraft, he went on, had made it clear in a
                            letter to the Portuguese Government that there are political reasons
                            behind the U.S. objections. If the planes had been sold to any other
                            country except Portugal there would have been no problem, thus a
                            political factor has been injected.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the problem centered on the fact that the planes had
                            been exported without an export license.</p>
                        <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>This is none of Portugal's business, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> is aware that the U.S. Government is
                            not responsible for a letter which might be written by a private
                            American firm. But Hamilton has made it clear that if the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> will make a declaration as to where
                            these planes are to be used, the U.S. Government will withdraw its
                            objections to the sale. Portugal is very honest on this subject,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said, and will not
                            make any declaration unless it can be implemented, which it cannot and
                            will not. Portugal wishes to preserve its integrity of its position and
                            will not mislead other governments by making meaningless declarations
                            for the purpose of avoiding controversy. Further, he said, Portugal will
                            not return these planes to anyone. They were paid for in cash and
                            purchased in very good faith. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            does not feel guilty politically, morally or legally.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would have to explore the question further
                            upon his return to Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese Embassy has been told that the matter might be brought up
                            in a U.S. court, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said,
                            and the U.S. Government has released information to the effect that
                            bilateral conversations will be held with Portugal on the subject.
                            “I must frankly state” <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said, “that I have instructed
                                <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> (the Portuguese
                            Ambassador in Washington) to make a statement that the conversations
                            have taken place, that the planes were bought in good faith, and that
                            Portugal is not responsible for any violation of U.S. law which might
                            have occurred. I wanted to let you know this,” he went on,
                            “and I feel the Portuguese position is
                            irreproachable.” Only the U.S. and Canadian firms can be
                            blamed for any illegality.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said that the fact that
                            these aircraft left the U.S. unarmed should also have a bearing on the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said illegal traffic in arms is a very serious matter for
                            the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> responded that
                            this was an American law but when foreign governments are called in, the
                            matter takes on a political coloration. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that foreign governments are
                            normally called in on cases where mutual enforcement of laws is
                            required. He cited the examples of Interpol, agreements to halt the
                            white slave traffic, and others.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> said that he could agree
                            with this but that when American private organizations sent arms or war
                            materials to groups of Angolan refugees or armed bands in Angola, the
                            U.S. Government never made a fuss. The U.S. does all it can to enforce
                            its laws on arms traffic, the Secretary answered. Portugal does not
                            dispute this, said <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName>, but
                            these are your laws and it is your business. If the U.S. courts are to
                            deal with the problem, it is one thing, but Portugal has been asked to
                            do certain things at the governmental level. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> has a very clear conscience, he reiterated, and has
                            violated no U.S. laws.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the contract specified delivery of
                            B-26's and <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName>
                            said that it called for 20 of them. Asked whether the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had expected these B-26's to
                            come from Switzerland, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName>
                            said he did not; but they might have come from Germany, France, Italy or
                            any place in the world. Portugal has ascertained that France is now
                            selling B-26's and the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            did not “have to know that these aircraft had to be U.S.
                            property at the moment” they were sold.</p>

                            proposal. Urged me continue discuss with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and suggested latter might treat subject during

                        <p>In résumé, <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> appeared convinced as ever <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> course of action in Africa is correct.
                            He does appear view future with some apprehension but sees this as fault
                            of great powers for having prematurely relinquished control. Very clear

                            Luxembourg. He recalled pre-ministerial meeting exchanges between <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0378"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> re possibility
                            his making full presentation Portugal's African policy.
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he had finally
                            decided not make such presentation upon learning Secretary's
                            response would be reiteration long-standing US views on
                            self-determination.</p>
                        <p>2. Referring to critical comments he had just made in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministerial debate on Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>'s
                            statement to House Foreign Affairs Committee, June 6,<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">Apparently a reference to <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>'s testimony
                                in support of the State Department budget. While the House Committee
                                on Foreign Affairs held hearings on June 6, Katzenbach did not
                                testify.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> said he strongly
                            objected to what he took to be Under Secretary's reference to
                            racial problems in Angola and Mozambique. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> particularly regretted implication that Portuguese
                            Africa was “infectious threat” to other African
                            countries. He said statement also implied, incorrectly in his view, that
                            except for southern Africa, political situation in continent was good.
                            Portugal was seriously concerned, he said, at what it had to consider as
                            official statement by responsible senior member State Department.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary replied he would discuss matter with Under Secretary but
                            wished to emphasize importance of some authentic expression of opinion
                            by people of Angola and Mozambique on their future. He asked whether
                            Portugal could anticipate likely results of plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> responded free plebiscite
                            would undoubtedly result in large majority for status quo. Difficulty
                            was, he said, that a vote under conditions acceptable to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> majority would seriously distort results.
                            He said, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would, for example, require
                            prior withdrawal all Portuguese forces and return of exiled
                            revolutionaries. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName>
                            said fact was that conditions for plebiscite could be drawn so as give
                            any result desired. Portugal, he said, could not afford to start down
                            such an uncertain road.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary asked whether plebiscite would not be useful even if more
                            extreme conditions desired by some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members were not met. Important thing, in Secretary's view,
                            was that results be credible for world opinion.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> recalled exchange between
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> in 1963<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v13#d357">Foreign Relations, 1961-1963, vol.

                            might be. He said US response had been negative.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary said might be useful on US side review 1963 exchange. He
                            stated that large part of problem in southern Africa, notably in South
                            Africa and Rhodesia, is maintenance of white rule by force. He was
                            personally convinced this could not work in long run.</p>
                        <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0379"/>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> disagreed and expressed view
                            most Africans in Rhodesia and South Africa support present regimes.
                            While not questioning US right disagree with <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>'s African policy, he believed US policy
                            based on refusal recognize reality. He said present situation in Angola
                            and Mozambique is not only stable but has belied predictions made by US
                            officials in early 1960's. He said African inhabitants have
                            full constitutional right at local and territorial levels as well as
                            parliamentary representation in Lisbon. He said this circumstance has
                            made no impression on those governments that long ago decided try and
                            oust Portugal from Africa.</p>
                        <p>9. Referring to Mid-East, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had refused subscribe to
                            proposed Maritime Declaration<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">Apparent
                                reference to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s
                                decision to establish a Standing Naval Force, effective January 1,
                                1968.</note> for several reasons: Israeli policy on Portuguese
                            Africa had been unfriendly; application of principles re freedom of seas
                            not universally applied.</p>
                        <p>10. Re Rhodesia, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said 169
                            tankers carrying petroleum had called at Portuguese African ports in
                            past year—58 were British-owned or registered, 27 French and
                            balance miscellaneous. He said not one of ships in question was
                            Portuguese but Portugal was being made scapegoat. In his view it was up
                            to governments involved control ships owned by their nationals or
                            registered in their countries.</p>
                        <p>11. Secretary said that, if facts were as described, he thought Portugal
                            had a point. In any case, he said, US has not been pressing Portugal on
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said Portugal will not
                            alter its course in Africa. He hoped find some way convince US of this.
                            He suggested desirability further discussion between himself and
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>13. Secretary said he would be in London in July for <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> meeting<note n="6" xml:id="d168fn6">The meeting was cancelled.</note> and would consider whether it
                            might perhaps be possible for him to visit Lisbon briefly at that time.
                            In parting, Secretary said he hoped <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> would consider whether some means could not be found
                            for populations of Angola and Mozambique to give an authentic expression
                            of their views on their future. He said this was very important for
                            Portugal's friends.</p>

                            note of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> views and proposals and
                            would personally bring them to attention of FonMinister.</p>
                        <p>3. Counselor urged upon Themido that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            remove this source of friction between two govts by providing assurances
                            planes would not be used outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            defense area (which assurances would have been required before any
                            export license could have been issued) if <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> could not bring itself to return planes to US custody
                            as <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> requested. He emphasized that use
                            of planes in Africa outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area
                            could have adverse effects on US-Portugal relations far exceeding
                            significance or value of planes themselves. He stated <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position that it was bona fide
                            purchaser for value not acceptable to US and pointed out evidence of US
                            origin in terms of contract and in delivery arrangements. Themido
                            especially interested in fact pilot returned to US directly from Lisbon
                            after each plane delivery and asked this statement be repeated.</p>
                        <p>4. Counselor also referred to Buffalo trial, pointing out (A) that jury
                            had acquitted defendants apparently because principal conspirator not
                            apprehended and not before court, and (B) trial judge had ruled that
                            defense allegation of complicity <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            agency in conspiracy was not proved. Object was to anticipate any
                            Portuguese contention trial outcome weakened US position.</p>
                        <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0381"/>
                        <p>5. Themido confirmed seven planes still in continental Portugal. He also
                            confirmed <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> adheres to position it was
                            bona fide purchaser for value. He implied US was exaggerating importance
                            and significance of implications of sale and use of few military
                            aircraft. Finally he took direct issue with US arms export policy,
                            saying <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> did not understand why US
                            imposed such restrictions on arms exports to an ally (in conformance
                            with resolutions of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which had been
                            considered irresponsible organization at restricted meeting during
                            recent <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial) when it made
                            available arms without similar restrictions to African states (he
                            mentioned Congo), some of which eventually used against Portugal.
                            Embassy officer denied US arms export policy for African states was
                            unrestricted or had effects stated. He added that though Portuguese
                            disagreed with US arms export policy, these planes were US origin and
                            legally subject to US export control. Themido did not comment further
                            but repeated he would convey US position to FonMinister.<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">In telegram 24437 to Lisbon, August 21, the

                                they would not provide any assurances that the aircraft would be

                        <p>1. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s most recent press interview, given in
                            late April to an obscure Argentine publication and published with
                            maximum play in Lisbon press and in Portuguese Africa during first week
                            of July (Embtel 1642),<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">Dated July 2.
                                (Ibid.)</note> was his most extreme to date. It has set tongues
                            wagging here, and even Portuguese who are stout defenders of the Estado
                            Novo and great admirers of <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> personally have volunteered their concern over
                            its general tone.</p>
                        <p>2. It was not so much Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s references, contemptuous as they were,
                            in referring to the United States as a country with
                            “insoluble racial problems” which takes it on
                            itself to preach to Portugal on Africa. Nor was it his taunting of the
                            United States on Cuba. He has said similar things in the past. Some of
                            the present language seems to have been lifted directly from earlier
                            interviews such as that of March 1966 with The New York Times
                            (Embassy's A-371 of 11 April 1966),<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., SOC 12-2 PORT)</note> although
                            he has never before been quite so bluntly ill-mannered. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has also said scathing things
                            about the U.S., but with more style.</p>
                        <p>3. Rather more indicative of change in <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s latest interview was his extreme
                            defensiveness about his own record and about Portuguese policies and
                            postures in general. His statements and strictures in this area were
                            both petulant and unyielding—rigid to the point of rigor
                            mortis.</p>
                        <p>Is Salazar Senile?</p>
                        <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0385"/>
                        <p>4. Some of my European colleagues, astonished and appalled at the
                            language used by the Prime Minister, have begun to whisper of senility.
                            While <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> has during the past
                            year been noticeably showing the weight of his 79 years, and his eye
                            trouble is rather well confirmed, it would still seem premature on the
                            basis of what we know to judge him senile. As of now I would be more
                            inclined to conclude that here is a very old man who is steeped in his
                            self-righteousness and bulwarked in his convictions through his success
                            in manipulating the local power levels firmly for 40 years—an
                            ancient who is increasingly disgruntled and querulous as he sees time
                            running out and himself unable to bring the world (or even substantial
                            and growing numbers of Portuguese dissenters) around to his views as to
                            how the world and Portugal should be ordered—in short, a man
                            who has stayed on too long.</p>
                        <p>5. It was precisely this latter mood which members of the Brazilian
                            Foreign Minister's delegation reported after their week-long,
                            intimate visit here early this month. During a schedule which was
                            crowded but carried off in cozy and confiding atmosphere befitting a
                            mother-daughter reunion, the Brazilians found <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> active and exercising his old
                            charm and good humor but showing definite slow-down signs as regards
                            physical vigor. They described even official and inner establishment
                            Portuguese as bored with their heavily encrusted government atmosphere
                            and as actively looking forward to end of era. These Brazilian
                            observations parallel Embassy impressions and are in line with views
                            expressed by members of Lisbon's foreign business community
                            on the basis of their local contacts.</p>
                        <p>Salazar Mystique Is Still There</p>
                        <p>6. This is not to say that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> has lost his hold on affairs or that his
                            mystique has evaporated. In Portuguese spectrum he has been right too
                            many times and been wiser than his critics on too many issues. Indeed
                            his legendary acumen was at work again during recent days in handling of
                            “folded arms” non-strike on Lisbon's
                            public transportation system, when service was not interfered with while
                            conductors simply refused to accept fares. After allowing this
                            essentially jolly situation to go on for several days, government by
                            fiat decided it was time for company (fact that company was
                            predominantly English-owned made action easier) to accept bulk of wage
                            demands. After this action the workers promptly appeared wearing
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> buttons, and there
                            has since been a carefully staged and widely publicized rally lauding
                            Salazar as friend of working man and dispenser of all good things.</p>
                        <p>7. For the moment, <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> gets
                            credit for having done workers, whom he does not allow to strike, a good
                            turn. If, however, this precedent should come home to roost in terms of
                            increased wage demands now being rumored with respect to locally owned
                            industries, atmosphere <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0386"/>could
                            quickly turn un-jolly. Wage pressures seem sure to build up over the
                            months ahead.</p>
                        <p>A Change of Atmosphere</p>
                        <p>8. Without wishing to overstate issue or to get ahead of developments
                            pace of which cannot now be judged, one might say that difference in
                            atmosphere between a year or even a few months ago and now is that
                            Portuguese are coming to admission, which for years they have
                            suppressed, that <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> is
                            mortal after all. He has been around for so long and handled matters so
                            generally well from narrow, traditional Portuguese point of view that
                            serious people were still saying seriously a few months ago they hoped
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> would just go on and
                            on and continue to take care of things. One seldom hears this expression
                            of faith nowadays.</p>
                        <p>9. The eventual removal—and it must be emphasized that precise
                            rhythm of process cannot be predicted—of what seems to the
                            overwhelming majority of Portuguese their rock of ages inevitably is
                            engendering a certain air of nervousness in the local scene.</p>
                        <p>10. It is interesting that this gestating nervousness does not have as a
                            primary ingredient concern over Portugal's African posture
                            and problems. Even those of the new generation who are increasingly
                            frustrated over home policies, and who have been critical of U.S.
                            involvement in Viet-Nam, strongly support the idea of Portugal in
                            Africa. Although there is inevitable griping over the demands of
                            military service, the cost of the wars in Africa (with the possible
                            exception of Guinea) continues tolerable to the Portuguese in both human
                            and fiscal terms. The national will seems set on staying in Africa, even
                            though more and more people may be coming to accept the inevitability of
                            future political adjustments there. The atmosphere of uncertainty
                            developing locally derives primarily from worries over the future of
                            European Portugal, and does not have at its base concern over
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Influence of France</p>
                        <p>11. This country was badly shaken by the events in France in May.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">Reference is to mass demonstrations that
                                nearly toppled President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                    Gaulle</persName>'s government.</note> It was
                            suddenly and starkly clear at various levels of Portuguese society how
                            easily a strong-man system could be brought to the brink of revolution.
                            Portugal is of course not France. It is presumably easier to hold down
                            the lid in a country like this one, with a largely illiterate and
                            unorganized people under a determined regime served by a pervasive
                            police apparatus and a strictly controlled press.</p>
                        <p>12. There have been audible sighs of relief here, both oral and written,
                            over <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            rebound, together with much public and private <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0387"/>admiration over the way he brought off
                            his recent elections. Informed quarters, however, recognize that there
                            are accounts to pay in France. The Portuguese will be watching French
                            labor adjustments apprehensively with an eye to their influence on the
                            increasingly pressed local wage structure. They will have concern over
                            the significance of educational reforms in France with respect to
                            Portuguese students who have been up to now surprisingly quiescent but
                            who have begun to show restiveness in recent months. There is
                            considerable expectation here of student troubles in the autumn.
                            Disorders in France could trigger something here.</p>
                        <p>The Succession to <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. Despite the general recognition they found among their Portuguese
                            contacts that <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> can no
                            longer be expected to go on forever, the Brazilians during their recent
                            visit got no more discerning guidelines for the future than the rest of
                            us. Their soundings received the usual stock answer which seems to
                            satisfy Portuguese, i.e., when <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> goes, the President will appoint another Prime
                            Minister. It seems incredible that men of high professional stature and
                            of important affairs, those who have more at stake than other social
                            classes as regards the future, should not concern themselves more about
                            the shape of things to come. Yet that is overwhelmingly the case.</p>
                        <p>14. In the muted speculation which goes on about the succession there is
                            little change in the usual collection of names which continue to be
                            bandied about. There is no indication that Dr. Salazar has given the nod
                            to anyone, and his remark to the Argentine interviewer that his
                            successor would be an “unknown” was not reprinted
                            here. If he has imparted any views on this subject to his faithful chief
                            of state, it is a deeply held secret.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Republic</p>
                        <p>15. Meanwhile, President <persName corresp="#p_TRAADR1">Thomaz</persName>, 73 years old himself, continues to go doggedly about
                            the country doing his patriotic duty as the loyal old sailor that he
                            is—and quite often in his sailor's uniform. He is
                            a man who always looks like his feet hurt him, but there is no local
                            festival, commercial inauguration or educational happening too minor to
                            merit his presence. At the major Evora Festival recently he drove
                            through the streets of that medieval town, standing in an open car and
                            waving to the crowd for all the world like a candidate for office. The
                            President always gets respectful applause—the Portuguese are
                            a courteous and respectful people—but there was in this
                            basically unstaged reception at Evora some warmth which went well beyond
                            the requirements of protocol. The President of the Republic is a
                            taciturn man who rarely expresses any opinion publicly or in
                            conversations with diplomats other than patriotic sentiments. Although a
                            rather amiable father-type figure who often appears at public functions
                            accompanied <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0388"/>by his
                            grandchildren, he gives every appearance on policy matters of being a
                            hardliner. He has close military connections, and certainly his cronies
                            belong to that group. In event of a sudden vacuum his views as to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s
                            successor could assume key importance.</p>
                        <p>The Estado Novo Tightens Up</p>
                        <p>16. The enigma of the future continues in Portugal, as inscrutable as in
                            Spain. Here at least there is an operating framework which includes both
                            chief of state and chief of government. Whether <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> will go on for some years yet
                            or whether we are on the threshold of an accelerating deterioration of
                            age which will bring earlier changes, only time will tell. As the regime
                            shows increasing signs of entering its final stage the inner power
                            structure, smugly satisfied with things as they are, has begun in
                            authoritarian style to tighten up, to turn further to the right. Recent
                            public statements by the Saurian Minister of Interior (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1674)<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">Dated July 11. (National Archives and Records Administration,
                                    <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967-69,

                            constituted grim warnings to all and sundry to stay in line. I am told
                            that contingency plans of the security forces have been recently revised
                            and toughened in anticipation of student problems in the autumn. The
                            church has also been put on notice.</p>
                        <p>17. The initial succession to <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>, when it comes will require the support of the
                            armed forces and should be largely in his image. However it goes, the
                            immediate successor will lack the immense authority which the present
                            Prime Minister derives from his 40 year rule. The successor may also be
                            of baser metal and lack the personal rectitude which has been one of
                            Salazar's principal strengths. The successor could be a real
                            dark horse, and there might be several changes in tandem before power
                            finally lodges. In the latter event, strains on military unity might
                            well develop. Assuming an orderly first act after <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>, the plot could then become
                            more intricate and involved.</p>

                        <p>2076. 1. Foreign Minister asked me to come to see him late afternoon
                            October 7 for our first meeting since change of government and naming of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Marcello Caetano</persName> as Prime
                                Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Following an accident,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> underwent

                                into a coma. President <persName corresp="#p_TRAADR1">Thomaz</persName> announced on September 26 that <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s doctors had
                                determined the Prime Minister would not recover, and he appointed

                                successor.</note> He wasted no time on preliminaries, emphasizing he
                            was speaking “on direction and with authority of”
                            new Prime Minister to present for attention of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in formal and solemn manner a statement of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> policy which latter considered of
                            highest importance. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco
                                Nogueira</persName> said he was making same statement to Ambassadors
                            of Brazil, Spain, France, Germany, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            South Africa, as representatives of governments which <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> considered to have particular interest
                            in matter. Statement concerned Portuguese policy in overseas
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> began by
                            commenting that there had been widespread view among foreign
                            governments, press and other sectors of public opinion abroad that
                            Portugal's African policies had represented personal position
                            of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>. Latter was
                            regarded internationally as a strong-minded individual who had seen his
                            country in a certain framework and had forged its policies in a manner
                            to suit his own vision of Portugal at home and overseas. Various
                            governments had come to conclusion that no changes were to be expected
                            as long as <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> remained at
                            helm of Portuguese affairs. However, there had been considerable
                            conjecture that, once <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>
                            left power, alterations would then begin to be made in <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> overseas policy.</p>
                        <p>3. Stressing again that he spoke on specific direction of new Prime
                            Minister, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> said
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> considered it matter of highest
                            importance to make its position unequivocally clear. Portuguese policy
                            with respect overseas territories “would not be changed in
                            the slightest degree.” Policies followed under Salazar were
                            not personal ones but represented a considered national view of
                            Portugal's interests. These national interests continued to
                            be valid and the new government was united in its determination to
                            continue as before. There would be no changes in overseas policy, he
                            repeated. Foreign Minister requested that I transmit this statement of
                            GOP policy to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>4. I inquired whether statement, since it being made to several
                            governments, would remain as oral one or whether we would be furnished
                            with aide-mémoire. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            did not seem to have thought much about this; he replied no
                            aide-mémoire would be furnished but then added that <persName corresp="#p_GVV1">Garin</persName> would later follow up with
                            presentation of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> views in call at
                                Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">No record of such a meeting
                                was found.</note> At another point in conversation <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> said consideration had
                            been given by new government to public announcement making clear its
                            unswerving adherence to existing overseas policy. This idea had,
                            however, been rejected as possibly raising rather than allaying doubts
                            and speculation, and it had been decided instead to make direct approach
                            to selected governments.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> then said he
                            would go farther and make an additional comment specifically for
                            background information of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. In
                            surprisingly direct reference to political maneuvering that went on in
                            inner government circles during week preceding <persName corresp="#p_TRAADR1">Thomaz</persName> selection of <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName> as new Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName> asserted he personally
                            had tried to stay aloof from situation but that his
                            “political friends” had been active. Discussions
                            during that period had made it absolutely clear that no Portuguese
                            Government could change the overseas policy and remain in power.
                            Attachment to present policies was strongly and firmly held. This was
                            honest Portuguese view, which had long considered its African posture a
                            contribution to Western cause. With recent changes in Czechoslovakia,
                            threats to Berlin and Rumania and renewed belligerent attitude on part
                            of Soviets, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> considered recent
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> speech at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> as ominous, particularly with respect
                            to its comments on Middle East and Mediterranean
                            area—Portugal was more convinced than ever that she serving

                            occasion for relaxed discussion re Caetano government's plans

                            and belligerency which he sometimes shows when discussing overseas

                        <p>2188. Subj: First Conversation with New Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>1. I made my initial call on new Prime Minister late afternoon, November
                            4, having held off asking for appointment during his first month in
                            office to give him time to settle in. Brazilian Ambassador also saw
                            Prime Minister yesterday.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName> received me in his
                            office alone, rising from meticulously clean desk as I entered and
                            greeting me with warm courtesy. He has reputation from his days at
                            university of enjoying conversation and exchange of ideas, and gave
                            every impression of welcoming opportunity for exchange of views.
                            (Interestingly enough, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco
                                Nogueira</persName> had sought to dissuade me from requesting
                            appointment, asserting that new Prime Minister did not wish to receive
                            foreign Ambassadors.) I believe we can look forward to reasonable
                            discussion and rational argumentation with <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName>, even though we may not always find
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName> emphasized he was
                            greatly looking forward to Secretary's visit. He spoke of his
                            interest in a “renewal of dialogue” with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> after some years of what he described
                            as “misunderstandings” between our two
                            governments. He went on to suggest, in more generous approach than we
                            are accustomed to hear from Portuguese officialdom, that both sides had
                            suffered from misunderstandings. I assured him of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and my personal interest in exploring
                            differences between us and in trying to ameliorate them.</p>
                        <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>4. For my part I stressed mutual interests and common tasks which USG and
                            Portugal share, mentioning that I had come to his office direct from
                            ceremony of delivery to Portuguese Navy of third destroyer-escort built
                            under shared-costs arrangement to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitment. Prime Minister proved already well
                            informed on that program. We reviewed recent Lisbon meeting of Atlantic
                            Treaty Association as example of common interest. I brought up also our
                            interest in program for exchanges of students and professors and
                            expressed satisfaction over recent decision by <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to make financial contribution to program. I said we
                            thought it useful to have American students and professors coming to
                            Portugal; before I could finish sentence Prime Minister broke in to
                            comment that it was very valuable for Portuguese students and professors
                            to have opportunity of spending some time in US.</p>
                        <p>5. Neither Prime Minister nor I brought Azores base or African problems
                            into conversation. It would have been counterproductive in this initial
                            talk, particularly in view of his lack of maneuverability at present on
                            latter issue.</p>
                        <p>6. I took occasion to compliment Prime Minister on dignity and
                            self-discipline shown by Portuguese during difficult period of past two
                            months in Portuguese life. He expressed appreciation and said he took
                            pride in the calm way in which the country had managed the change-over
                            from <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> regime and was now
                            adjusting to new ways of doing things.</p>
                        <p>7. He commented with satisfaction that there was now a new spirit in the
                            country. I agreed and remarked that one was particularly conscious of it
                            in the daily press, going on to add that evidences of more freedom of
                            expression had made a very favorable impression in US, with our devotion
                            to freedom of the press. <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName>
                            took up this theme, stating that censorship had been relaxed a great
                            deal already. He put emphasis on fact that his is a new administration
                            which feels itself free of the past, but balanced that by saying that
                            this is a difficult and delicate time and that transition would have to
                            be carried out in a “suave” manner. After all, he
                            said, laying his palms out expressively and smiling, Portugal is
                            changing from a regime which went on for forty years.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Franco Nogueira</persName>
                            stated that in April or May of the last year the Portuguese had received
                            a detailed report from New York on a conversation between a prominent
                            American friendly to Portugal and a highly placed Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegate. The Soviet delegate had stated
                            that while the Soviet Union was hostile to the Portuguese regime for
                            various reasons, it would not like to see a Portuguese collapse in
                            Angola and Mozambique in the foreseeable future because they were not
                            yet prepared to exploit the resulting situation. Instead they were
                            interested in Portuguese Guinea because it dominated the Cape Verde
                            Islands where the Soviets would hope to establish a base giving them a
                            strategic position in the south Atlantic. The Foreign Minister stated
                            that the strength of insurgent activity in Guinea had increased
                            considerably in recent months. The insurgents appeared to have Soviet
                            and Czech armament in unlimited quantities. The training of guerrillas
                            in the Republic of Guinea with Soviet supervision and support appeared
                            to be increasing with 6,000-8,000 being the current intelligence
                            estimate. The insurgents had introduced an entirely new type of land
                            mine apparently of Chinese manufacture which was very difficult to
                            detect and was causing the Portuguese great difficulties. There were
                            reported <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0394"/>to be large stocks of
                            these mines in the Republic of Guinea ready to be shipped. The
                            Portuguese forces in Portuguese Guinea amounted to 20,000 troops and to
                            demonstrate proportions the much larger area of Angola had a Portuguese
                            force of only 50,000.</p>
                        <p>According to the Foreign Minister the Governor of Guinea, General
                            Spinola, had made a three hour presentation to the Portuguese National
                            Security Council (Note: on October 29, 1968) in which he requested
                            reinforcements of troops and material and stated that unless these were
                            forthcoming, he “would not be in a position to discharge my
                            responsibility for the security of the territory” and an
                            eventual collapse would occur. The Foreign Minister stated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would try to provide as much as
                            they could and while he and the Defense Ministry felt that Spinola was
                            painting too dark a picture, he wanted the US to know that the situation
                            was really serious and that the Portuguese were worried. He added that
                            he was putting this observation forward with no ulterior motives. While
                            of course there were purely Portuguese motives for staying in Guinea,
                            the loss of Guinea and by extension the loss of the Cape Verde Islands
                            would also be a Western problem of very great importance.</p>
                        <p>In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>'s question, the Foreign Minister stated
                            that the loss of Guinea would have a tremendous impact on the Cape Verde
                            Islands because the Islands and Guinea were completely inter-related
                            economically, socially, politically and ethnically. In answer to the
                            Secretary's question, <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> stated that he was quite certain the support
                            for the insurgent activity emanating from the Republic of Guinea was
                            Russian in origin rather than Chinese and he was quite prepared to allow
                            US experts to examine captured armaments to prove the point. The
                            Secretary replied that the US now had better leverage with the Republic
                            of Guinea than 2-3 years ago and perhaps something could be done.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the Secretary's question as to whether Soviet
                            ships had been spotted off the Portuguese-African territories since the
                            closing of the Suez Canal, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NAF1">Nogueira</persName> replied affirmatively and added that Chinese
                            “spy ships” had also been spotted at several
                            points.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that at the insistence of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName> the Ministry of
                            Defense was undertaking a study of the US use of the Azores Base at
                            Lajes. This would be followed by a Foreign Ministry study. At sometime
                            in the future, possibly before the end of the year, the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would make proposals either in
                            Washington or in Lisbon on the base. It was not the intention of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to be difficult or
                            “fussy” about the base nor to cause the US any
                            special problems. He saw the problem in the light of world conditions
                            and in the mutual need for cooperation. With the continuing threat of
                            the Soviet Union and of other world problems the need for cooperation
                            between the US and European countries was important. On the other hand
                            Portuguese African policy which had been under attack for ten years was
                            now being seen by other countries in a different light. The Azores was
                            one area where US-Portuguese cooperation was possible. Such cooperation
                            was also possible in Africa and in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the US Government was now in the process
                            of transition although it would be useful for him to inform his
                            successor. The Foreign Minister immediately replied that the date of the
                            Portuguese presentation had no significance.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Secretary's question the Foreign Minister
                            stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would deal only on a
                            bilateral basis and was not interested in Lajes as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base. The same policy applied to the
                            Beja air base where the Germans, under the terms of a bilateral
                            agreement, had certain rights and facilities. Some countries such as the
                            Netherlands, <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0396"/>Turkey and Greece
                            had indicated interest in the use of the Beja base and had been turned
                            down. The Foreign Minister also reiterated that local relations with
                            regard to the Azores base were excellent. There were no outstanding
                            problems except for a small administrative one of smuggling from the PX
                            at Lajes which would have to be faced sometime in the future. He added
                            that the Azores shipping agreement had worked out nicely. Portugal had
                            not been entirely satisfied with the agreement, he said with a smile;
                            therefore, it must be a good one.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary expressed greetings from President Johnson noting that both
                            the President and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM2">Caetano</persName> had assumed office in a moment of sadness. The
                            Prime Minister stated that he had been very happy to receive a message
                            from President Johnson on his accession to office in which a reference
                            had been made to the maintenance of cordial relations between the US and
                            Portugal. The Prime Minister reiterated that feeling and added that
                            “we are friends and must be friends”.</p>
                        <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>According to the Prime Minister the first Portuguese concern in
                            US-Portuguese relations is the hope for better US understanding of the
                            Portuguese position both domestically and in Africa. On the internal
                            situation it was his impression that US public opinion failed to
                            understand that special circumstances operating in Portugal would not
                            permit the type of government which would be the most acceptable to the
                            US. However, it happened to be the government most suitable for the
                            Portuguese. The government of Portugal was in the process of evolution.
                            Naturally after forty years there had to be things which required
                            moderating. This had to be done carefully and slowly in order to avoid a
                            collapse which would be dangerous for the Atlantic Alliance. Impatience
                            from friends or outside pressure could be fatal to Portugal and
                            dangerous to the Atlantic Community.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Prime Minister's request for his views on
                            Africa the Secretary stated that the US was not leading a crusade on the
                            African question and had no interest in the disappearance of the
                            Portuguese presence from Africa. It was not the US that raised questions
                            in the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. When they came
                            up, of course, we had to express our views, which were not always the
                            views of our Portuguese friends. Out of our own national experience we
                            had developed a point of view that a great deal depended on the
                            expression of the authentic views of peoples in areas like Angola and
                            Mozambique. The Secretary cited the case of Puerto Rico, although
                            stating it was not analogous to the situation in the Portuguese African
                            territories, to demonstrate how the US had met criticism in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the status of the island by the simple
                            response of “ask the Puerto Ricans.”<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">Reference is to the 1967 plebiscite which defused
                                Cuban efforts to have Puerto Rico considered as a separate item by
                                the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.</note> He
                            had the impression that there was a stronger feeling among the people of
                            Angola and Mozambique for Portugal than somehow the Portuguese had been
                            able to make public and known.</p>
                        <p>In response the Prime Minister cited the tribal state of native
                            populations both in the Portuguese territories and in the other African
                            lands, which he asserted made elections a farce. What was undeniable was
                            control of a region like Mozambique with less than a division of troops,
                            a valid demonstration that it was an integral part of the Portuguese
                            nation. Another undeniable fact was the foreign base of the subversion
                            being launched against the Portuguese territories. In addition in the
                            Prime Minister's view when public opinion manifested itself
                            through modern processes it never expressed the deep feelings of the
                            people but rather the thinking of certain leaders. The elite of the
                            native populations in the Portuguese territories were sufficiently
                            evolved to produce such an opinion but because of their European
                            education <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0398"/>and their very
                            association with the Portuguese governmental structure they had become
                            detribalized. Therefore, the Portuguese Government considered the
                            friendliness and readiness to accept the present situation on the part
                            of the natives of Angola and Mozambique as an expression of opinion by
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that it was his impression that in the last two or
                            three years the attitude of the African States toward the Portuguese
                            territories had moderated to some extent partly because they had
                            understood that the issue in the Portuguese territories was not strictly
                            speaking a racial one. The Prime Minister replied that
                            Portugal's social objective in Africa was what Portugal had
                            accomplished in making Brazil a multi-racial society and was an
                            eminently human work which could not be precipitated. He was certain
                            that Africa and particularly southern Africa needed the white man not
                            only as a technician but also as a settler. Collaboration between whites
                            and natives was essential to the progress of that region.</p>

                        <p>President Johnson met with the Spanish Ambassador in the Treaty Room of
                            the White House before the start of the Diplomatic Reception.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador informed the President that he had been named Ambassador
                            to the Holy See, and would be leaving soon. He said he had conferred at
                            length in Madrid with members of the Spanish government, and with
                            General Franco, who had asked him to convey a personal letter to
                            President Johnson.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">A copy of the letter,

                            Ambassador thereupon gave the President the original letter and an
                            English translation. The Ambassador said he regretted leaving
                            Washington, and that he wished to emphasize how important to Spain were
                            good relations with the United States. He stressed repeatedly that Spain
                            recognized the United States as the great defender of the Free World,
                            and as the major factor in resistance to Communism and in the search for
                            peace. He said that whatever differences there might be between Spain
                            and the United States, such as the question of trade with Cuba, must be
                            seen within the broad framework of Spanish-US friendship which was a
                            vital element in Spain's foreign policy.</p>

                            to hear the Ambassador was leaving. He knew how much Ambassador

                            Spanish policy of close and friendly relations with the United States.
                            The President said he reciprocated these sentiments.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the matter of trade with Cuba was an extremely
                            serious one and that he felt that Spain must consider the effects of
                            this issue on the course of Spanish-US relations, as well as on the
                            fortunes of the Free World as a whole. He emphasized that Castro was an
                            instrument for penetration and subversion of democratic governments and
                            institutions, not only in the Western Hemisphere but, as recently shown
                            in the case of Zanzibar, in other parts of the world. It was the purpose
                            of the United States to bring about the end of the Castro regime so that
                            Cuba could be ruled by a freely elected and democratic government. For
                            these reasons the United States Government looked to its allies to cease
                            trading with Cuba in order not to lend Castro economic support, or to
                            make things easier for him. The President said he felt very strongly on
                            this matter and he hoped that this fact would be taken into account by
                            the Spanish Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador did not reply directly to the President, and the
                            conversation ended on this note.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Subsequently, during the reception,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GDCA1">Garrigues</persName> expressed
                            to me his unhappiness and concern about the question of Spanish trade
                            with Cuba and the emphasis which the President had placed on this
                            matter. I told the Ambassador that he should be aware that the United
                            States Government did indeed feel very strongly that our allies should
                            do everything possible to reduce, or, better still, eliminate trade with
                            Cuba in critical commodities. The Ambassador argued that Spain had
                            needed sugar and that Cuba was the best source of supply. He also
                            referred to the British and the French and said it was obvious that the
                            other allies of the United States were not following our policy in this
                            area either. I said that this was going to make difficulties all around,
                            that there should be no misapprehension on the part of the Spanish
                            Government as to the importance of this issue to us, and I mentioned the
                            provision in the Foreign Assistance Act under which aid cannot be given
                            a country which permits its ships or planes to be <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0401"/>used for trade with Cuba.<note n="5" xml:id="d177fn5">Reference is to Section 620a of the Foreign
                                Assistance Act of 1964, P.L. 88-205, approved December 16, 1963. For
                                text, see 77 Stat. 386.</note> I also said I understood that the
                            five Spanish ships engaged in trade with Cuba all belonged to one
                            individual. My remarks seemed to make the Ambassador uneasy, and he said
                            that this matter was very complicated. The Ambassador said that the
                            Embassy has been working on a formula which he thought might be
                            reconciled with the provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act, and that
                            it had been sent to Madrid for the Spanish Government's
                            consideration. He said that he hoped Spain's trade with Cuba
                            which was so small and of so little importance would be looked at by the
                            United States Government within the framework of Spanish-American
                            friendship and close alliance. I said I thought that the attitude and
                            actions of the Spanish Government on this issue would be considered by
                            the United States Government as an indication of the value which the
                            Spanish Government places on our relations.</p>

                        <p>2766. In farewell call by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GDCA1">Garrigues</persName> on Deputy Under Secretary Johnson March 4,
                            both expressed gratification for successful outcome Section 620 <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> talks. Johnson said that, while this
                            settled legal question of transportation by Spanish ships and aircraft,
                            there remained policy question of trade, and referred to press
                            despatches from Madrid in this regard. Ambassador stated that, from his
                            talks with Franco and Foreign Minister, he absolutely certain Spain had
                            no policy for large or long-term increases in trade with Cuba. Serious
                            but hopefully short-term shortage obliged Spain purchase Cuban sugar,
                            which would have to be paid for primarily in Spanish goods. Sugar
                            shortage should be resolved within two years.</p>
                        <p>Johnson urged that to maximum possible extent such payments be made in
                            “soft goods” and pointed out that Spain could
                            expect US <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0402"/>to be especially
                            sensitive to sales of machinery, transportation items, spare parts and
                            replacements. Garrigues repeated it was absolutely out of question that
                            Spain would greatly increase trade with Cuba. He said Spain's
                            relations with Cuban exiles and Latin America obliged <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> to be moderate and discreet in its
                            relations with Cuba. <persName corresp="#p_GDCA1">Garrigues</persName>

                        <p>During his call on the Secretary, Spanish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> reviewed Spain's
                            position on relations with the European Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>). The Minister said that as the renewal
                            of the U.S.-Spanish Defense Agreement provided for an exchange of views
                            he desired the U.S. to understand fully the Spanish position on this
                            important problem. The Minister said that although Spain's
                            relations with the U.S., Latin America and the Arab countries were of
                            first importance, <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0403"/>Spain's policy for many years had also been designed to
                            draw Spain closer to Europe. Thanks to Spain's improved
                            economic position achieved with the help of the U.S. and international
                            organizations, Spain's relations with Europe had improved
                            greatly. Some two years ago Spain decided that her economic future lay
                            in association with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to which
                            Spain's exports were greatest. While seeking association with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, Spain remains strongly
                            committed to European unity.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago Spain sent a letter to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council asking for talks leading to Spain's
                                association.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">The February 9, 1962,

                            psychological impact in Spain. Spain's labor and business men
                            reviewed their thinking and operations and the autarkical system in
                            Spain was being dismantled in preparation for Spain's
                            entrance into the Common Market. After a careful study of the Rome
                            Treaty no clause was found to which Spain could not subscribe. As a
                            result of the expectation that Spain would eventually be a member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Spain had evolved considerably
                            economically and socially, as any impartial observer could attest.</p>
                        <p>Spain was requesting associate rather than full membership as it would
                            take approximately 10-12 years for the Spanish economy to be ready for
                            full membership. In essence Spain desired relations with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> similar to those of Greece and Turkey.
                            There was no need now to decide on full membership for Spain.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said the crisis over British membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> had delayed consideration of the
                            Spanish petition. Now that such consideration was being given, maneuvers
                            by Spanish exile groups with Socialist circles in Belgium and Italy had
                            resulted in opposition in those countries and the Netherlands to
                            Spain's association. France and Germany were giving strong
                            and active support to the Spanish application. The Spanish exile groups
                            apparently considered that membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> was a matter of life or death for the Spanish regime.
                            The Minister said that this was not the case. However if the door to the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> were to remain closed, Spain of
                            necessity would be forced to re-orient her trade and other policies.
                            Spain, which is on the threshold of an ambitious economic development
                            plan, is at an important cross-roads. The <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> needs to know in which direction Spain's
                            future lies. It is because of this that her relationship to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> needs to be determined. A change of
                            Spain's present policies would result in turning Spain on an
                            inward course, interrupting encouraging Spanish evolution <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0404"/>towards liberalized institutions and
                            integration with Europe. Spanish trade would also have to be re-oriented
                            with unforeseeable results.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that Mr. Spaak, the current head of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council, was taking the position that
                            Spain could associate with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> in a
                            commercial sense. The Minister said that commercial discussions with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> were not of great significance
                            to Spain as Spain was a member of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>,
                            and commercial problems could be resolved there. However, a form of
                            economic association with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> which
                            would involve certain financial advantages is what Spain sought.</p>
                        <p>The Minister reviewed the problems for Spanish association originating in
                            Italy. He said the Italian Socialists were putting great pressures on
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG1">Saragat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NP1">Nenni</persName>. The Minister noted that the Rome
                            Treaty had not set up political qualifications for <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> membership. However there may be an
                            element of agricultural competition between Italy and Spain. The
                            Minister said that very confidentially the Spanish Government had been
                            assured of support for its position by leading Italian political figures
                            as well as industrial and other influential elements and that
                            Italy's position had already begun to soften. The Italians
                            had very great commercial and investment interests in Spain. The Spanish
                            market was an expanding one and Italian interest in this market would
                            influence Italy's position. The Minister said these factors
                            had been brought to the attention of the Italian Government.
                            Italy's opposition to Spanish <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> association was harmful to the Spanish people. It did
                            not matter much if Spain were excluded from NATO but exclusion from the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> was a serious problem for Spain
                            and Spain would be forced to act to protect her interests. The Italian
                            problem seemed on the road to solution as just recently the Italian
                            Foreign Minister had assured the Spanish Ambassador that Italy would not
                            impose obstacles to conversations regarding Spanish association with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Belgium too was greatly interested in the Spanish market. However the
                            Belgians had been told their opposition to Spain on the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> question would affect
                            Belgium's position in the Spanish market. The Social
                            Democratic party in Belgium was assuring Spain of its support for the
                            Spanish position and Spain was confident that the Belgian position also
                            would change. The Netherlands had a very favorable balance of trade and
                            Spain had hoped the Dutch position too would undergo modification.</p>
                        <p>The Minister repeated that Spain was not seeking full membership but only
                            discussions which would lead to the most appropriate economic
                            relationship for Spain given the present circumstances. The Minister
                            said that while he believed the matter was developing favorably he
                            requested that the Secretary put in a good word with the Italians and
                            Mr. Spaak so as not to interrupt Spanish evolution along the road which
                            is desired by all. A meaningful relationship of Spain to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would be to everybody's
                            interest.</p>
                        <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>The Secretary listened without comment to the Minister's
                            presentation and noted his arrival in Brussels on May 9th at the time of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council meetings<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was in Brussels May 9 to address

                        <p>I called the Spanish Ambassador this afternoon and told him I was
                            speaking to him quite personally and informally. I told him that because
                            of your high regard for him you had not wanted to dwell too long on how
                            upset you had been by the <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> story out
                            of Madrid, according to which the Spanish government held the United
                            States Government responsible for the aggression against the Spanish
                                ship.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">The Aranzazu was attacked on

                            fully aware of your position. He repeated that this news story was a

                            Spanish Foreign Office, the text of which he had received and which bore

                                Spain.</note> He said that the Spanish Government has charged that
                            the British action in giving a measure of self government to the people
                            of Gibraltar violates the Treaty of Utrecht. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said that his government does
                            not regard limited self government as constituting a transfer of
                            sovereignty which is forbidden by the terms of that Treaty. The British
                            Government is prepared to negotiate with the Spanish Government on such
                            problems as smuggling, but it is not prepared to negotiate on the
                            question of sovereignty. Furthermore, it is not prepared to negotiate
                            while the Spanish continue their harassment at the border. He asked if
                            there was any way in which the US could help.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in the case of Puerto Rico we have always been
                            able to tell critics to ask the Puerto Ricans what their wishes were
                            with respect to the relationship with the U.S. He asked the Foreign
                            Secretary <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0407"/>if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could take a similar line with respect to
                            Gibraltar. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> replied
                            that there is no doubt but that the people of the Colony would support
                            continued British rule. They have no desire to see a change in
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would see what we can do to counsel
                            moderation. The Spanish Foreign Minister will be in Washington this week
                            and the Secretary said he would try to find out what he could about
                            Spanish intentions.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">A March 24 memorandum of

                        <p>The Foreign Minister congratulated the President on the successful Gemini
                                flight.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">Reference is to Gemini III,
                                which made a 3-orbit, 4-hour flight on March 23.</note> The
                            President thanked the Foreign Minister and said that he thought the
                            relations between Spain and the United States were on the whole good,
                            though he could not understand why the Spanish government was dealing
                            with Cuba and purchasing sugar above world market prices. At the
                            President's request, Mr. Bundy succinctly outlined the
                            reasons why the United States feels that it is against the interest <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0408"/>of the free world as a whole,
                            and in particular of the Latin American countries which are the target
                            of Communist intervention and subversion, to have dealings with Cuba
                            which strengthen that country's economy. The Foreign Minister
                            said that Spain had made the sugar agreement with Cuba last year because
                            it was in need of substantial sugar imports. He also said that Spain had
                            eliminated its own shipping with Cuba. However there were many Spanish
                            nationals in Cuba, whose interests and well being the Spanish government
                            had to bear in mind. He said that there was one flight a week between
                            Spain and Cuba and that there were 40,000 applications for this flight
                            from Spaniards wishing to be repatriated. The Foreign Minister also said
                            that wheat had been sold by Western countries to the Soviet Union and
                            Communist China, and he implied that these transactions were comparable
                            to Spain's contract for purchase of Cuban sugar. Mr. Bundy
                            then pointed out the difference between the Spanish case and the grain
                            sales. He said that the latter had no effect on the stability of the
                            Soviet regime, whereas even a difference of 2 or 3 per cent in the Cuban
                            economy could make things easier or harder for Castro. He repeated that
                            if it were merely a question of dealing with Cuba by ourselves, there
                            would be no problem, but that the issue was Castro's policy
                            toward other countries in this hemisphere, and of the economic resources
                            available to him in order to continue to carry out that policy.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Foreign Minister thanked the President for having
                            received him, and mutual good wishes were exchanged.</p>

                        <p>With a good deal of interest and appreciation, I read your synthesis of
                            our policies here in Spain. There was not one idea expressed which I

                            thoughts that seem worth putting on paper.</p>

                                1963).<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">Entitled “Comments on

                        <p>Turning to specific matters, however, it may be that in the future some
                            opportunity may present itself for collaboration with other Western
                            European countries in projects in Spain, and I believe we should be
                            alert to this possibility. I was reminded of this the other day when the
                            French Ambassador suggested to me that American and French policy toward
                            Spain was identical, even though it might be for different reasons. He
                            alleged that France now encourages powerful neighbors in Germany, a
                            self-reliant Spain, and a stable Italy and since he considered that the
                            U.S. wanted an independent and sturdy
                            nation—Spain—on Europe's south flank,
                            we should be able to collaborate in certain fields. My French colleague
                            was perhaps a little ingenuous in this suggestion since we are quite
                            clearly rivals in Spain from the point of view of investments, the
                            development of atomic energy plants, space operations, military sales,
                            and almost what have you. But nevertheless his comments reminded me of
                            this general proposition of cooperation that might be possible in some
                            cases, if not with France, with others such as Germany.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically I might note that the French Ambassador in the same
                            conversation declared that Spaniards in many circles are reluctant to
                            even contemplate integration into Europe because of fear of rejection on
                            the one hand, and of inferior status on the other. He went on to say
                            that we should do everything possible to make them conscious of their
                            opportunities as Europeans. I have no quarrel, of course, with his later
                            statement that we should make them conscious of their opportunities as
                            Europeans. However, I think there is little doubt that knowledgeable
                            Spaniards are quite conscious of the fact that Spain must become a part
                            of an integrated Europe, and certainly most of the <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0410"/>opposition wants such integration for
                            political purposes. Officially, of course, Spain has made its bid to
                            become an associate member of the Common Market and while there are
                            many, it is true, who fear the consequences for Spain from an economic
                            point of view if the application were to be accepted today, there is
                            little danger of this and they are counting on perhaps two or three
                            years of further negotiating delay at least in order to put their own
                            economic house in order, the better to compete at some future date.
                            After all, the Economic Development Plan<note n="6" xml:id="d183fn6">Reference is to Spain's second Five-Year Economic
                                Development Program, 1963-1967.</note> has this premise as one of
                            its basic considerations.</p>
                        <p>One point which we might keep in the back of our minds insofar as
                            Spain's integration with Europe is concerned, is the
                            possibility of some form of collaboration with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on a local regional basis. The prize of Spanish
                            membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is apparently
                            impossible, but such limited collaboration might not appear to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> as simply a back-door
                            association, and it would make sense militarily, especially as Spanish
                                <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capabilities increase. I am
                            thinking of the possibility of <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss>
                            collaboration in the new <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Iberian
                            Command to be established in Lisbon;<note n="7" xml:id="d183fn7">

                                headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, was transferred to Lisbon in
                                1967.</note> the discussions of Maltese association with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might perhaps suggest some
                            possibilities in this direction.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be well for the U.S. to bear increasingly in mind
                            certain dangers that may develop for Spain, and possibly for our
                            interests here, at the time of transition. The problem as I see it is
                            that it seems almost inevitable that at the point in time when Franco
                            disappears from the scene, European labor organizations and some of the
                            European socialist parties may very probably seek to intervene in some
                            way or another in the Spanish scene. The problem is not only that of
                            outside intervention, to which the Spanish inevitably react strongly,
                            particularly if it is clumsily done, but also that many of those groups
                            will be working from an emotional background of 25 years ago. I think we
                            must give some serious thought to this problem as it could seriously
                            exacerbate the internal problems that might develop within Spain during
                            the sensitive transition period. Greater exchanges of visits between
                            this Embassy and our other missions in Europe certainly will help to
                            educate our own European embassies to the complexities of the Spanish
                            situation, but there may be situations that will arise in which our
                            missions can be helpful in making representations to various European
                            socialist parties and labor groups so that such possible intervention
                            might at least be channeled along intelligent lines.</p>
                        <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0411"/>
                        <p>The other day we reviewed the situation in Spain with Joe Slater of the
                            Ford Foundation and discussed various ways in which the Foundation might
                            support our efforts here. We all agreed that it would be useful to
                            establish here a forum for the stimulation of interest in international
                            affairs such as a Foreign Affairs Council. Slater subsequently discussed
                            the idea with the Conde de Motrico, former Ambassador to the United
                            States and France, and other Spaniards and got an enthusiastic reaction.
                            Through Slater's initiative an organizing committee has been
                            set up and visits to countries which have Foreign Affairs Councils will
                            be arranged with financial assistance from the Ford Foundation.</p>
                        <p>Shifting to the subject of our contacts with the Spanish opposition, I
                            would only suggest that we should bear in mind the necessity of
                            maintaining our flexibility. What I mean by this is that for the present
                            we must be careful in such contacts not to become overly identified with
                            any one group. Some of the older opposition leaders are beginning to
                            fall by the wayside, and inevitably there will be a rise of new leaders
                            in the indeterminate time between now and the date on which the
                            transition or “crisis” period begins. This is
                            particularly true in the labor field where I am convinced that the
                            future labor leaders of Spain are probably young people whom neither we
                            nor Spanish labor itself has as yet identified. Flexibility in most
                            circumstances would seem to be the most desirable posture—at
                            least initially.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another area entirely, I think we should also consider the
                            necessity of placing some of our operations in Spain on a more formal
                            permanent footing that might provide some assurance of carrying on in
                            the event of a radical shift of government in Spain at some point in the
                            years to come. Actually it appears that the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> as well would like this formalization of some of our
                            commitments. I might cite as an example our <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> facilities in the Canaries<note n="8" xml:id="d183fn8">An agreement on space research projects was concluded by an
                                exchange of notes in Washington April 14, 1966. For text, see 17
                                    <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 493.</note> which are
                            founded at present solely on an exchange of letters. In this particular
                            instance you will of course be aware that the Spanish Government itself
                            has suggested that the Canary Islands <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> facilities be formally tied in with the Robledo
                            complex outside of Madrid in a new arrangement between our two
                            governments that hopefully we will begin to negotiate next fall.</p>
                        <p>As a final thought I should like to underline the fact that we must bear
                            in mind that while we do have substantial influence in Spain, and while
                            good Spanish-U.S. relations are a prime keystone of present <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> policy, our influence here is also
                            limited (particularly in political matters) by the fact that although
                            Spain's world position is assisted by its relations to the
                            U.S., we are the ones normally requesting facilities for <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0412"/>projects of one kind or another ranging
                            from the base complex through extensive <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> facilities to special communications stations. This
                            does not, of course, mean that we cannot exercise our influence, even in
                            political matters, from time to time when it seems important for us to
                            do so, but it does mean that we must exercise considerable caution and
                            be particularly adept in doing so.</p>
                        <p>As to the succession problem, I will have more to say on this after our
                            military establishment committee has had a chance to present some of its
                            preliminary thoughts. It is a subject of course with which you and I
                            will have to keep in continuous touch.<note n="9" xml:id="d183fn9">In an

                        <p>My dear President Johnson:</p>
                        <p>I am most grateful to you for making available to me such a sincere
                            report on the South Vietnam situation and of the efforts, both in the
                            political field and through diplomatic channels, which the United States
                            is coupling with its military action in an attempt to open the way for a
                            peaceful settlement. I am well aware of your responsibilities as the
                            leading nation of the world at this time, and I share your interest and
                            preoccupation, in which we Spaniards join with you at all times. I am
                            well aware also of the fact that a military abandonment of Vietnam by
                            the United States would affect the whole security system of the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Because of my military and political experience, I am in a position to
                            appreciate the great difficulties which the task you have undertaken <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0413"/>involves: the guerrilla warfare
                            in the jungle is decidedly favorable to subversive native elements and
                            allows them to contain superior forces with only a small number of
                            troops; the most powerful weapons would lose their effectiveness against
                            small scattered objectives; there are no vital objectives to destroy to
                            put an end to the struggle; established communications are held on to
                            precariously and only through the deployment of great number of troops.
                            It would be very difficult to defeat subversion with conventional
                            weapons. War in the jungle is an unlimited adventure.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, although acknowledging the unavoidable consideration
                            of your country's prestige which might be involved, it would
                            not be possible to disregard the conflict's possible
                            immediate consequences. Lengthening the war, would serve to impel the
                            Vietnamese into becoming an easy prey for Chinese imperialism, and even
                            assuming that the strength of the Vietcong could be broken, the sporadic
                            attack of the guerrillas would continue for a long time and would
                            therefore demand a prolonged military occupation of a country where you
                            would always be regarded as foreigners. The results evidently would not
                            seem to compensate the sacrifices entailed.</p>
                        <p>Although subversion in Vietnam may at first glance seem to be a military
                            problem, it really is, in my opinion, a profound political problem; one
                            included in the destiny of new nations. It is not very easy for the West
                            to understand their innermost and deeply rooted problems. Their struggle
                            for independence has stimulated nationalist sentiments; their lack of
                            interests to protect and their state of poverty impel them toward
                            social-communism, which offers greater possibilities and hopes than the
                            liberal system sponsored by the West, that reminds them of the great
                            humiliation of colonialism. Nations generally tend to favor communism
                            because, apart from its power of seduction, it is the only effective
                            avenue left open to them. The play of Russian and Chinese Communist aid
                            appears to them to be a matter for opportunity and profit.</p>
                        <p>We should not lose sight of these facts. Things are as they really are
                            and not the way we would like them to be. We must work with the
                            realities of the new world and not with chimera. Is not Russia a reality
                            with which we have had to cope? May we not be sacrificing now the future
                            to apparent demands of the present? In my opinion, we have to help these
                            nations to find their political way just as we have found our own.</p>
                        <p>In the face of new events, it is not possible to maintain the rigidity of
                            old attitudes. What the big nations in Geneva agree upon<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">Reference is to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
                                Conference.</note>—and whether such decisions will please
                            the people and secure their conformance— <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0414"/>are two different matters. It is
                            difficult to defend in the future and in the eyes of the world, this
                            artificial separation of the nations, which even if it was expedient at
                            a given moment, will always leave a longing for unity open.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the problem is very complex and that it is determined by
                            an American interest to defend the nations of Southeast Asia from the
                            threat of Communism; but since this problem is eminently political in
                            character, it is not solely possible to dispel this threat by the force
                            of arms.</p>
                        <p>In observing these events from the European area, as we do, we may be
                            mistaken. Let us continue, however, to hope that everything can be
                            solved, since fundamentally the principal parties involved hope for the
                            same thing; the United States, that Chinese Communism will not invade
                            the territory of Southeast Asia; the nations of Southeast Asia, to keep
                            China as far as possible from their borders; Russia, that her future
                            rival, China, will not expand and grow; and Ho Chi Minh himself wishes
                            to unite Vietnam into a strong nation which China will not absorb.</p>
                        <p>I do not know Ho Chi Minh, but in view of his record and his efforts to
                            expel the Japanese, first, the Chinese next, and the French later, we
                            must give him credit for being a patriot who cannot be indifferent to
                            the annihilation of his country. And apart from his well-known
                            reputation as being a tough adversary, he could, without doubt, be the
                            man of the hour needed by Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In the higher interest of saving the people of Vietnam and of Southeast
                            Asia, I think it is worthwhile for all concerned to make some
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>I have wished, my dear President, to make known to you these confidential
                            observations in terms of honest and sincere friendship. Although I know
                            that many of these considerations are constantly in your mind, I have
                            wanted to give you my loyal appraisal of the situation in the service of
                            peace and of the future of the Asiatic countries.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Ambassador:</p>
                        <p>You recently discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> the significance of a statement made by the
                            Secretary of Defense during Congressional hearings on the Department of
                            Defense appropriation for the coming year.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">In telegram 192 to Madrid, August 24, the Department of State
                                reported that <persName corresp="#p_MVAMA1">Merry Del Val</persName>
                                had presented <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> with a
                                memorandum dated August 24 “indicating <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> very upset and astonished over
                                remarks by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.” (Ibid.) A copy of the Spanish
                                memorandum is an attachment to a September 3 memorandum from
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. (Ibid.) For text of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s February 26
                                statement, see U.S. Senate, Committee on Appropriations, Department
                                of Defense Appropriations, 1966, Part I (Washington, 1965), pp.
                                343-344.</note> These hearings are held every year over a period of
                            months and relate to all aspects of the United States military effort
                            and requirements of the Department of Defense and the military
                            establishment. The particular statement to which you referred consisted
                            of extemporaneous responses by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to four questions during the hearings held last
                            February 26.</p>
                        <p>I have reviewed, together with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the questions and answers to which your
                            Government has drawn attention. I would like to emphasize that the
                            response to which you referred concerning the relationship of Spain to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was descriptive of the present
                            situation and in no way detracts from the public position of the United
                            States Government and Congress as favoring Spanish membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We realize that such membership may
                            be achieved only with unanimous agreement of all the parties
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>United States recognition of the important role of Spain in the security,
                            well-being and development of the Atlantic and Mediterranean areas
                            remains as stated in the Joint Declaration of September 26, 1963.<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">See <ref target="#d177fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 177</ref>.</note> This question did not arise in the
                            course of the hearing at which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> testified. It is unfortunate that the brief
                            responses given to the few questions posed at that time could have given
                            any other impression.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that Spain is making a major contribution to the defense of
                            Europe through its agreements and arrangements with several <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, including the United
                            States, through the use of Spanish <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0416"/>military and other facilities, as well as through the
                            extensive cooperation between the Spanish armed forces and those of
                            several <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries including our
                            own. I recall the statement of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
                            on June 13, 1963,<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">For text, see U.S. Senate,

                                213-214.</note> that this contribution by Spain is
                            “important to the defense of Western Europe as well as the
                            United States.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s
                            statement was related in no way to the spirit and courage of the Spanish
                            armed forces, whose dedication and valor have been demonstrated on many
                            occasions. The United States Government, under the Military Assistance
                            Agreement with Spain, has been contributing to the efficiency and
                            capability of those forces for more than ten years, and continues to do
                            so under the current five-year program of military training and
                            equipment grants and sales, and concomitant ship loans.</p>
                        <p>I ask that you inform your Government that we consider relations between
                            our two countries to be based on cordial and sympathetic understanding
                            of the interests and responsibilities of both countries, that our mutual
                            security depends upon a continuation of these close and friendly
                            relations, and that we trust no other construction will be placed upon
                            these basic considerations.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called at his request. He presented a memorandum
                            concerning the bombing of the Spanish ship Satrustegui in the harbor of
                            San Juan, Puerto Rico.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">The memorandum was
                                not found. An explosive charge rigged to the hull of the passenger
                                ship detonated on October 9. Approximately 100 passengers on the
                                ship escaped serious injury.</note> The Ambassador asked if the
                            investigation by U.S. agencies had produced any indication as to the
                            perpetrators of the act. He asked if anyone had been detained. He cited
                            specifically the Cuban refugee leader Orlando Bosch who in statements to
                            the press had assumed responsibility for the attack.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the attack on the Satrustegui was a more serious
                            affair than the attack last year on the Aranzazu because the latest
                            incident had taken place in U.S. territorial waters and Bosch made his
                            statement in Miami.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">See <ref target="#d180fn2">footnote 2, Document 180</ref>.</note> He said
                            it was a well-known fact that no Spanish ships called at Cuban ports and
                            the shipping company to which the Satrustegui belongs has not permitted
                            its ships to call at Cuban ports for over three years, at great loss to
                            the company. The Satrustegui was now laid up for repairs and this
                            Spanish Company (The Compania Transatlantica) would suffer further
                            losses.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he regretted to state that the Spanish Consul General
                            in San Juan reported that he was receiving no cooperation from local
                            authorities there with regard to the incident.<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">In a November 3 letter to FBI Director J. Edgar

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> replied that the
                            appropriate U.S. agencies were conducting a very vigorous and active
                            investigation of the incident. The agencies were aware of the statements
                            made by Mr. Bosch.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the incident could very well have serious adverse
                            repercussions in Spain which would redound to Castro's
                            benefit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> repeated that
                            the U.S. was using its investigative resources vigorously.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he hoped he would soon have a satisfactory
                            explanation to forward to Madrid.<note n="5" xml:id="d187fn5">In
                                telegram 350 to Madrid, October 11, the Department of State
                                instructed the Embassy to inform Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> that the incident would
                                be thoroughly investigated and those found responsible brought to

                            Bosch claiming responsibility constituted a second problem to the
                            incident itself since either Mr. Bosch was responsible for the bombing
                            and should be prosecuted or was insane and should be put in an
                            asylum.</p>

                            result, such a detonation could cause a radiation hazard. However, if
                            the detonation was minimal it is possible that no radiation hazard would

                            point. Stathos appeared shaken, stated he had obtained information on
                            this point “at third hand” and repeatedly
                            apologized for filing story without checking with Embassy (see F
                            below).</p>
                        <p>E. Following discussions subparagraphs C and D above, Ambassador

                            quickly accepted. Sagaz listened intently and showed keenest interest in
                            account Stathos admission he had not received information re
                            “US diplomats” attitude from Embassy, but from
                            other source. We assured Sagaz we open to any Spanish suggestions on how

                            indicated concurrence, said he had no suggestions to make for time being
                            and appeared calm, albeit obviously concerned. EmbOff had impression
                            Sagaz wanted get Stathos incident particularly clear to report to

                            telephoned Ambassador to reiterate apologies, offer make retribution and
                            disclaim any attempt “make trouble.” He added that
                            he now believed he “had been had” by his Spanish
                            information sources (otherwise unidentified) for political reasons and
                            expressed apprehension about his position in Spain.</p>

                        <p>A. Reuters reported rumor that in village near Vera yesterday about 50
                            people milled about, some shouting: “Yankees go home and take
                            your bombs.” Reuters correspondent did not witness and <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> InfoMin officially denied. AP carried
                            denial last night.</p>
                        <p>B. AP correspondent Milks has just filed interview with unnamed Spanish
                            official saying medical specialist found small area at site of main
                            bomber wreckage initially radioactive and “only normal that
                            people working over that spot have been contaminated.”
                            Official added: “But if so, this is very, very slight and
                            offers no danger to anybody. All traces should have disappeared
                            completely in two or three days.”</p>
                        <p>C. Of three Madrid morning dailies, only Ya carried follow-up story
                            today: brief but reassuring front page story headed: “Search
                            and security measures proceeding in Almeria. No danger from air accident
                            exists. Inhabitants of involved zones have not been
                            evacuated.” Story in same tone says: “Life goes on
                            normally in affected zone since local measures which adopted in small
                            degree represent only excess caution. Proof of this is that inhabitants
                            of little rural settlements in zone have not been
                            evacuated.”</p>

                            Albuquerque already in Spain and three more due arrive January 23.</p>
                        <p>4. Believe we must be prepared for continued and possibly increased media
                            treatment of accident until fourth bomb located and removed. If much
                            more time elapses without success in search, we may be faced with
                            practical necessity admitting officially one bomb still missing. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It
                            therefore clearly of utmost urgency that no effort be spared locate
                            fourth bomb with minimum delay. Urge all necessary US resources be
                            provided for search.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> referred to the
                            Spanish Government note of January 22 to all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> governments,<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">Transmitted
                                to the Department of State in airgram A-464 from Madrid, January 22.
                                (Ibid.)</note> except the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            regarding the overflight of Spanish territory by military aircraft of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries intending to land at
                            or taking off from Gibraltar. The British representative intended to
                            make a statement on this note at the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                            meeting on January 26. The statement would make three principal
                            points:</p>
                        <p>1. Gibraltar was not a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base.</p>
                        <p>2. Gibraltar was, in fact, a British base. Use was made of it by
                            Britain's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies at the
                            invitation of the British Government.</p>
                        <p>3. The British Government regretted any Spanish action which might
                            curtail the use of facilities on Gibraltar which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offered to its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. The effect, however slight, would be to make
                            more difficult the defense of the West.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador went on to say that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was particularly anxious to have U.S. support for this
                            statement. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> considered that the
                            position taken by the U.S. would have an important effect on the
                            attitude of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that this was a
                            difficult problem for us. Our position with Spain was a special one
                            inasmuch as we had a bilateral agreement with the Spanish Government. An
                            additional point was that this was not purely a State Department
                            problem; other agencies were concerned. We would need some time to work
                            out our position.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0426"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked if there was any
                            particular hurry. He noted that we had just received the text of the
                            Spanish note and had not had time to study it. Also, the Spanish had
                            included an additional point in the note they sent us. They had asked us
                            not to have our planes operating from Spanish bases land at
                            Gibraltar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Scott said Shuckburgh had mentioned the possibility of getting the
                            discussions on Gibraltar postponed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this would be the best course for us.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> said that from the
                            British point of view, it was more important to get the right answer
                            than a quick answer. He said that Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> was very interested in the
                            Gibraltar question. He would probably want to raise it on Thursday
                            during the discussions on the British defense review.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName> left the attached
                            aide-mémoire setting forth the British position.<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>The Ambassador called to inquire about the <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            conversations and to discuss Spain's position on the

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> said the Gibraltar dispute had been
                            mentioned briefly during Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName>'s visit. However the United States
                            had made clear <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0427"/>its desire not
                            to become involved in this dispute. The Ambassador said he hoped the
                            United States would comprehend Spain's point of view which,
                            he said, was not one of hostility to the defense efforts of the West
                            since Spain's contributions to that effort were well
                            known.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said Spain's
                            view of the matter was receiving very careful consideration by the
                            Department. We would soon be in a position to reply. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked what purpose Spain had in
                            mind in raising the Gibraltar problem in this form.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that Spain's purpose was to put the
                            Gibraltar dispute in its proper context, namely as a bilateral dispute
                            between Spain and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Spain wished it
                            to be clear that Gibraltar could not be considered by Spain as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base.</p>

                            points in somewhat emphatic manner:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> attaches greatest significance to
                            forthcoming Gibraltar negotiations with UK. Successful outcome these
                            negotiations will have significant influence on Spanish attitudes re
                            contribution to defense of Europe. Without satisfactory solution this
                            problem Spain will be forced review its policy of defense cooperation
                            with countries other than those having bilateral defense agreements with
                            Spain (U.S., Portugal, France and Morocco). Countries not enjoying such
                            arrangements especially UK, Benelux, Germany and Italy, will secure
                            Spanish cooperation only through such defense arrangements as Spain
                            freely agrees to enter. Minister said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            aware that without Spain's acquiescence
                            Gibraltar's military usefulness limited. He hinted same was
                            true of German base in Portugal now under construction. In short third
                            parties should be interested in favorable outcome Gibraltar talks.</p>
                        <p>b. Spain will press her “candidacy for Europe” with
                            renewed vigor. Spain's vocation and avocation is Europe as
                            glance at map will prove. When queried re desire for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership he said Spain not
                            specifically asking for such membership since it is granted by
                            invitation only. Nonetheless Spain expects in near future to be fully
                            taken into account in any organization for the collective defense of
                            Europe whatever its form. Furthermore Spain is not prepared to wait
                            forever for relationship with Common Market. Spain will expect its
                            friends to push for favorable action on Spanish application to <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He noted approvingly public statements
                            by Schroeder in this regard.</p>
                        <p>c. Above considerations will dominate Spanish negotiating posture for
                            renewal defense agreement with US in 1968 as well as Spain's
                                <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0431"/>relations with European
                            nations. He was instructed put US on notice that extension defense
                            agreement will have to result in expanding present bilateral agreement
                            and would call for active role by US in integration of Spain into
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>d. Minister said in other words Spain is no longer content to be sitting
                            at small table for two in same dining room with US and other European
                            countries.</p>

                            see him same day and took occasion launch into hard hitting bid for US
                            support Spanish aspirations in Gibraltar dispute.</p>
                        <p>2. He began by lamenting reports to effect Ambassador “not
                            sympathetic” to Spanish position. Asserting Gibraltar problem
                            over-riding in Spanish relations with West, Castiella urged us recognize
                            potentially serious repercussions on US and Western defense interests
                            (he mentioned overflights and base agreement extension) if Spain
                            rebuffed and forced seek other foreign policy options. He claimed Spain
                            had already been approached to join new partnership along what he called
                            “French and Soviet line” adding that for present
                            Spain of course not taking such <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0432"/>overtures seriously. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then
                            stressed great importance of military base in Western Mediterranean and
                            traced out concept of vast military base complex involving Rota,

                            had come from French sources.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Reports of active and increasing
                            machinations by French are in marked contrast to assurances given
                            Ambassador and DCM personally by French Ambassador in recent months to
                            effect that despite divergencies on military matters France intent on

                            seem represent rather forced attempt to show that Spain has
                            “somewhere else to go” if its aspirations not
                            satisfied in present context.</p>
                        <p>6. However, suspect <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>'s outburst stems more from his
                            impatience and frustration over poor outlook early solution Gibraltar

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>On my visit to Washington last month I unfortunately missed seeing you,
                            but had the opportunity to explain, first to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and Alex Johnson, and then to the
                                President<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">No record of these meetings
                                was found.</note> my views in some detail on the desirability of
                            drawing Spain into the Western Alliance. The President did not express
                            himself one way or the other, but I was very encouraged by the attention
                            he gave to what I had to say.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> has received your reply of June 23 to his
                            earlier letter on the Gibraltar problem<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">Copies of <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>'s May 26 letter and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s June 23 reply are

                            his way to impress on me how grateful he was for the friendly and
                            understanding tone of your letter. His enthusiasm reflects his intense
                            preoccupation with Gibraltar, and, I believe, underlines the importance
                            of some progress on that thorny problem so that it will not stand in the
                            way of considering a place for Spain in the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>In the light of my conversation with the President, I have hopes that
                            both these matters can be reviewed with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0434"/>on his visit to Washington
                            later this month.<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">See <ref target="#d266">Document 266</ref>.</note> While I fully realize the
                            desirability—even the necessity—of
                            non-intervention in the Gibraltar matter, it may well be that a word
                            from the President to the Prime Minister expressing our hope for a
                            reasonable solution might be helpful in avoiding the consequences of a
                            bitter stalemate.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Spanish have told us that they will use all possible
                            leverage to achieve some advance on the Gibraltar problem and toward
                            their other pressing foreign policy objectives. We are beginning to feel
                            the effects of their efforts, particularly in our military relations. In
                            a broader sense, however, I believe the moment has arrived for us and
                            our European friends to take action if we are not to forfeit the chance
                            of helping Spain emerge from the approaching crisis of succession with a
                            reasonably liberal government and an anchor to westward.</p>
                        <p>An understanding on this subject with the British would make it possible
                            for us to move ahead on approaches to our other friends in Europe on
                            Spanish membership in the Alliance.<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">In a

                        <p>During the Ambassador's call he referred to Spain's
                            strong interest in some form of association with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. He said by September Spain expected to
                            know what form this association might take. He noted the French and
                            Germans had been particularly helpful in supporting Spain's
                            petition. He believed the Belgian position had altered but that Italy
                            and the Netherlands were still to some degree opposed to Spanish
                            association.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said Spain also desired to be integrated into whatever
                            European defense structure emerged from the current discussions. Spain
                            hoped the U.S. could do a little more to help speed Spain's
                            integration into Western defense. Mr. Johnson asked if the Gibraltar
                            dispute would not complicate Spain's association with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that a
                            satisfactory Gibraltar solution could well facilitate Spanish
                            participation in Western defense. He noted that already Spain was
                            contributing more to Western defense than the Scandinavian countries
                            opposing Spanish <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership. Mr.
                            Johnson said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had a “lot
                            on its platter” at the present time, and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was now caught up almost exclusively
                            with the present stage of internal readjustments. He believed an
                            Anglo-Spanish agreement on Gibraltar would be helpful in any
                            consideration of Spain's role in Western defense. The
                            Ambassador noted that aside from Gibraltar Anglo-Spanish relations had
                            every reason to be good as British trade and tourism to Spain were
                            assuming greater importance.</p>

                            British military aircraft. Ambassador stressed that British pilots
                            apparently have instructions deliberately to violate air space over
                            Spanish mainland and that Spain could no longer tolerate such
                            intrusions. Secretary asked what purpose British would have in doing so.

                            countries would eventually find a way to settle this problem.</p>

                        <p>My Dear President Johnson:</p>
                        <p>Please forgive me for retaining your attention for a few moments, but I
                            trust that the importance of what I have to say will justify my writing
                            directly—to Your Excellency.</p>
                        <p>The publicity which is being given in Morocco to the announced visit of
                            His Majesty the King to the United States<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Documentation on King Hassan's February 4-12 visit is in

                            neighbours—Algeria, Mauritania and Spain—and
                            reveals Morocco's intentions to exploit the King's
                            visit to the United States to attempt to present the United States as
                            being implicated in her aspirations. I have therefore thought it best to
                            forewarn you of this possibility; firstly, because none of the parties
                            affected are ready to cede their rights, and in our case the Spanish
                            right of sovereignty is clear as is the firm and repeatedly evidenced
                            loyalty of the people of the Sahara—about 26.000 inhabitants;
                            and secondly, because this sparsely populated territory has a very
                            marked geo-strategic importance as it includes an extensive portion of
                            the African coast immediately adjacent to the clearly Spanish Canary
                            Islands, which are a center of world sea-routes, and which Spain has for
                            centuries developed and defended.</p>
                        <p>Among the objectives publicized in Morocco for this visit is that of
                            asking the American Administration for a larger economic and military
                            aid. While I find their economic interest legitimate and very convenient
                            for the peace, development and internal stability of their country, in
                            which we are truly interested, such is not the case with respect to
                            military aid. The American Government is aware through our
                            Representatives of the constant Spanish concern with respect to the
                            increase of armaments taking place in North Africa with the general
                            intention of threatening peace and attempting to satisfy imperialist
                            ambitions in conflict with neighbouring countries. But no one is
                            threatening the integrity of Morocco's frontiers; she already
                            has sufficient weapons for her defence and for her internal peace and
                            security; and Spain, who only a few years ago underwent the aggression
                            of supposedly spontaneous bands which Morocco utilized to break the
                            peace in the territories of Ifni and Sahara, now feels alarmed by
                            Morocco's attempt to secure more arms at a time in which she
                            is stirring up bellicose feelings in her inhabitants. It is really
                            incongruous that when Morocco's economic need is at its
                            greatest she should wish to devote to military expenses amounts far in
                            excess of her means in the hope that another country will finance
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I have wished Your Excellency to be acquainted with this concern, in
                            order to avoid the possibility that, in the light of an apparent
                            neutrality, and heeding a supposed need for self-defence which has been
                            ably and artificially contrived, your Administration might err on the
                            side of generosity in this military aspect.</p>
                        <p>Due to my great confidence in your judgement and fairness, I feel
                            satisfied in having made this known to you.</p>
                        <p>At these moments, when the United States is going through a great sorrow
                            at the loss of her heroic astronauts, I wish to express to you the
                            solidarity and appreciation that this sacrifice has inspired throughout
                            all the Spanish nation.</p>

                                story revealing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> funding of the
                                National Student Association was released to the press on February
                                14. The story was subsequently picked up by the European press. In
                                its February 21 edition, the London Times reported on assistance
                                furnished to Spanish student groups. President Johnson directed the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to cease its funding
                                activities on February 15.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> explained that this matter
                            was causing President Johnson concern and that a very high level review
                            and investigation were underway. He emphasized however that what has
                            been said of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> activities should not
                            be interpreted as a change in American policy or of the
                            President's attitude of friendship with Spain. <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName> said he was sure that the
                            President was unaware of many details of the activities of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Franco reacted to <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Valenti</persName>'s comments with good humor saying the
                            current <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> issue is illustrative of the
                            problems of leadership at the highest level. He said he sympathized with
                            President Johnson in this situation and understood it well. He then
                            pointed out that in the security field agents too often act on their own
                            initiative.</p>

                        <p>1. At the conclusion of the discussion on Gibraltar,<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">The memorandum of conversation covering this part
                                of the discussion is ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                                19-GIB.</note> the Secretary inquired whether the Foreign Minister
                            had discussed all the topics on his list which he had read to him at the
                            beginning of the meeting. The Secretary added that the question of base
                            negotiations had been on the Minister's list.</p>
                        <p>2. The Minister replied in the affirmative and said that the question of
                            renewal of the base agreements had been the reason for his visit to
                            Washington. He said that he had come here on an official mission on
                            behalf of his Government to request that the 1963 base agreements, due
                            for renewal in 1968, be revised. He added that by and large Spain was
                            satisfied with the existing relationship, but that there had been many
                            changes in the last four years. He said it was the position of Spain
                            that the agreements of 1963 must be revised and adapted to the current
                            world situation. He enumerated some of the changes which had <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0441"/>occurred since the signing of the last
                            agreement, such as French military withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the Soviet penetration into the
                            Mediterranean, the increased Chinese thermonuclear potential, the
                            development of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems by the
                            United States and the U.S.S.R., and the pending <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He stated that serious consultations would be
                            necessary before renewal of the bases agreements could be agreed on.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary asked how we should proceed on this subject, and the
                            Foreign Minister replied that in order to avoid problems and a last
                            minute rush similar to what had happened in 1963, talks should begin
                            soon—as soon as possible. He expressed the opinion that
                            diplomatic channels should be used, of course, without prejudice to
                            advice and assistance from the military.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary suggested that it would be worth having such
                            conversations through diplomatic channels, which might begin with a tour
                            d'horizon to determine what needs to be done first.</p>
                        <p>5. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>
                            replied that he was in complete agreement, and added that these
                            conversations should be on a friendly basis and should consider the
                            question in depth and in detail. He stated that neither country should
                            fall into the infantile pitfalls of saying such things as
                            “the bases are no longer of any interest to the United
                            States” or “Spain does not need the friendship of
                            the United States”. He suggested that the bases were useful
                            and that our friendship was based on a solid foundation, even though no
                            relations between two countries could ever be completely perfect.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary replied that our friendship with Spain was important to
                            us and that we would be willing to brief the Spanish in great detail on
                            matters of mutual interest, as, for example, the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and its full significance, the question of
                            China's nuclear potential, and others.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in reply to the
                            Secretary's inquiry stated that we could set up briefings on
                            various subjects mentioned by the Secretary either in Washington or
                            Madrid and that we would be in touch with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MVAMA1">Merry Del Val</persName> regarding the
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>8. The Foreign Minister replied that it was fine to receive these
                            briefings, but that he wanted to emphasize that we should not delay too
                            long in getting to the negotiations. The important point at the moment
                            was to go directly to the foundations of the agreements and begin
                            discussions for their revision.</p>
                        <p>9. In conclusion, the Foreign Minister said that Spain considered itself
                            a friend but not a satellite of the United States. The Secretary agreed
                            with this statement, and the meeting ended with mutual assurances that
                            the negotiations should be accomplished in the spirit of continued
                            cooperation between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>Before the arrival of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName>,
                            the question of the proposed U.S. gift of a desalting plant to Palomares
                            was discussed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAB1">Duke</persName>
                            stated that he had just come from a meeting with Mr. Herman Pollack,
                            Director of the Office of International Scientific and Technological
                            Affairs, in which Mr. Pollack had reported that a telegram had been
                            received from Madrid forwarding the results of the water sample tests
                            made at Palomares. Mr. Pollack said that a preliminary reading of these
                            results indicated a desalting plant was technically feasible. (At this
                            point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> joined the
                            meeting.)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he hoped a public announcement of the U.S. gift could
                            be made as soon as possible in order that the date of the announcement
                            would be as far in advance of the January 17 anniversary of the
                            accident. He believed it was important that our offer become part of the
                            historical record during the current calendar year and in advance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> special television program on
                            the accident now scheduled for early 1968.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> program, he said it
                            was the Embassy's understanding that the <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> was favorably impressed on two counts:
                            first—the work of the U.S. Claims Commission; secondly, the
                            manner in which the nuclear contamination problem of both the residents
                            and the area had been promptly examined and the happy results of these
                            examinations. However, there was a third area, he said, in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> apparently believed there was
                            some legitimacy to complaints. He <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0443"/>said this was the question of something being done
                            about the problem of non-measurable damage—psychological as
                            well as material. It was with this problem in mind that the Embassy had
                            originally proposed a gift to the people of Palomares. He thought we
                            could effectively meet this point by announcing the gift as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the prompt announcement of the U.S. offer could not
                            help but improve the atmosphere for the base negotiations. He said we
                            must remember that the accident brought home to the Spanish, in a most
                            dramatic way, that the American military presence in Spain was not
                            without serious risks to Spain.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Spanish Base Negotiations</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had seen several estimates by the U.S.
                            military services and they appeared persuasive of the U.S. need for
                            continued use of the Spanish bases for an additional five years. He said
                            he had not seen a specific Department of Defense position, but he
                            assumed that Defense would sustain the services'
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wyle stated there were several studies or reports which all supported
                            the strategic importance or need for the Spanish bases and indicated no
                            real disagreement with the individual estimates of the services.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the problem we face as we enter into
                            negotiations with the Spanish for a renewal of the Base Agreements
                            hinges on the Spanish political objectives and their anticipated
                            requests for military hardware. He said it was his view that to the
                            extent we can meet their political requests, the military shopping list
                            will be correspondingly reduced. However, the Ambassador said it is
                            apparent that we cannot meet their objectives for membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and admission to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, nor are we prepared to extend to Spain
                            diplomatic support in their dispute with the British over Gibraltar. He
                            noted that the Secretary had reaffirmed the U.S. policy of absolute
                            neutrality on Gibraltar to the Spanish Foreign Minister on November 13,
                                1967.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">See <ref target="#d206fn2">footnote 2, Document 206</ref>.</note> He said there remains
                            the Spanish request for an escalation of the present commitment
                            (contained in the 1963 Joint Statement) to a U.S.-Spanish treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the State Department's Legal Advisor was
                            examining the various forms of commitments which the U.S. might make,
                            ranging from a simple executive agreement on the one hand to a legal
                            treaty on the other. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] The Ambassador said in negotiating with Spain he
                            hoped he would be able to demonstrate to Spain that we are prepared to
                            offer it the same type <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0444"/>guarantee we have extended to others [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Spanish request for a treaty, he mentioned that Mr.
                            Aguirre de Carcer, Director General for North American Affairs in the
                            Spanish Foreign Ministry, had reported that in a conversation with
                            Senator Fulbright in Geneva, Switzerland, the Senator had told Mr.
                            Aguirre de Carcer there would be no difficulty in getting Senate
                            approval of a U.S.-Spanish treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">Not
                                further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In considering the kind of commitment we are prepared to offer Spain, the
                            Ambassador said he thought it was important to bear in mind that the
                            Spanish were more interested in the form than the actual substance of
                            such a commitment. For this reason, he said, their first objective is a
                            treaty which would be public and would demonstrate that Spain had
                            obtained something of significance from the U.S. in exchange for the
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that if we were unable to accommodate satisfactorily
                            the Spanish on their request for an improved form of a mutual defense
                            commitment and at the same time, because of the lack of U.S. military
                            assistance funds, we could not satisfactorily meet their request for
                            military equipment, then the Spanish might very well ask for our
                            withdrawal from the bases because not even the Franco regime could
                            justify to its citizens our continued use of the bases if there was no
                            demonstrable benefit for Spain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that Defense
                            recognizes the difficulty we will have in meeting Spain's
                            political objectives and that we will have to consider offering them
                            some form of military hardware. He said the problem in meeting either
                            their political or military hardware requests originates in the same
                            place: the Congress. He recalled that the Congress has indicated it is
                            opposed to any new defense commitments by the U.S. and at the same time
                            is cutting back on appropriations for U.S. military assistance. He said
                            this latter action is, at least to some extent, inter-related to the
                            first because the Congress believes that military assistance results in
                            the U.S. becoming involved in increased commitments; hence by cutting
                            back military assistance, the Congress puts a block on increased U.S.
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> said that part of the
                            problem in obtaining military assistance funds for Spain is that all of
                            the various types of military assistance are lumped into one
                            appropriation. He explained there are two types of assistance in which
                            there is not much Congressional opposition. These consist of the
                            assistance to countries where we are helping improve the indigenous
                            forces in order to replace American troops, <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0445"/>such as South Korea, and assistance to countries as
                            “rent” for essential bases, as in the case in
                            Spain. These types of assistance are the easiest to justify but,
                            unfortunately, they are included with the
                            “conventional” form of military assistance against
                            which the Congress is directing its objection. He said Defense was
                            trying to find some way to sort out the various types of military
                            assistance. Specifically, he said, we might have to separate out the
                            “rent” in order to get the necessary funds, and he
                            wondered what the Spanish reaction would be if U.S. military assistance
                            to Spain was publicly described as “rent”. He
                            asked the Ambassador if he thought he could live with such a
                            development.</p>
                        <p>On balance, the Ambassador said he thought we could. He said while there
                            might be some rumblings in Spain—such as critical editorials
                            in certain newspapers—he thought the Spanish Government would
                            not strongly object. He said there was a tacit realization among
                            Spaniards that the U.S. would not be giving Spain assistance if it were
                            not for the bases.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he would like to mention some positive factors as far
                            as the base negotiations were concerned. While the difficulties that had
                            been already discussed were valid, he said we also have certain
                            “pluses” in our favor. He said that the Foreign
                            Minister had told the Secretary on November 13 that Spain and the U.S.
                            had successfully maintained a relationship for 15 years which had been
                            of mutual interest and advantage to both countries. The Foreign Minister
                            said Spain, for its part, was prepared to continue this relationship and
                            it was the Foreign Minister's estimate that this was also the
                            wish of the U.S. The Foreign Minister said that it was on this basis
                            that the two countries should negotiate an extension of the agreement.
                            He had concluded that as it was in the interests of both countries to
                            continue the relationship, he believed that both countries had the same
                            goal of achieving a successful completion of the negotiations. The
                            Ambassador said he thought we could expand on this point by adopting the
                            point-of-view in the negotiations that the U.S. and Spain shared what
                            might be described as a community of interest in the continuation of our
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was looking forward with keen interest to hearing
                            the preview of the Briefing Team's presentation at the State
                            Department, December 8. He hoped the Team members would very much have
                            in mind that the Spanish would be listening attentively for anything
                            that would support their contention that the bases are more valuable to
                            us now than they were five years ago. They attribute this increased
                            value to the new Soviet presence in the Mediterranean. The Ambassador
                            said he recognized this was a very delicate and difficult task for the
                            Team, but he thought they should place emphasis that the Soviet presence
                            represented a real political threat to all the countries of the
                            Mediterranean, including Spain.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wyle said he was in agreement not only with the objectives as
                            described by the Ambassador but also with his assessment of the
                            difficulties of achieving these objectives because the fact of the
                            matter was that the U.S. Navy, for example, is making the same point as
                            the Spanish—the Soviet presence has increased the importance
                            of the U.S. bases in Spain.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said we should also try to think of ways we can suggest to
                            the Spanish that while the bases are important, their importance is
                            lessened because of restrictions in their use. By restrictions he said
                            he meant the suspension of nuclear overflights and that
                            Spain's present policy in the Middle East restricted the use
                            of the bases by the U.S. in support of possible U.S. actions in the
                            Middle East.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                        <p>On the subject of the extension and revision of our Defense Agreement
                            with Spain, which the Spanish have asked be negotiated, I believe it is
                            useful and appropriate to provide State with a Department of Defense
                            position, supplementing the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (as set
                            forth in JCSM-35-68 of January 18, 1968, and JCSM-247-68 of April 17,
                                1968).<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">Both entitled “U.S.
                                Bases and Facilities in Spain.” They are in Joint Chiefs
                                of Staff, Historical Office, Joint Master Files, Case File 967/470/8
                                June 68.</note> The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> papers have
                            already been forwarded for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense considers that the availability of the Spanish
                            base complex for the next five years will continue to be militarily of
                            great importance to the United States. I therefore believe that we
                            should make every effort to negotiate a full extension of all the base
                            and operating rights which we now have in Spain, and that we should be
                            willing to pay in return a quid pro quo approximately equal to that
                            agreed in 1963. We should leave flexible, however, the particular level
                            of our presence in Spain. As you know, studies are now under way in
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> aimed at improving our balance
                            of payments vis-à-visEurope. It is possible that the results
                            will involve changes in the nature and size of our presence. This
                            possibility, however, should not affect our current negotiations with
                            the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>Inherent in our judgment about the Spanish base complex are such general
                            factors as the difficulty of establishing alternative bases, our limited
                            access to other facilities on the northern shore of the Mediterranean
                            and in North Africa, the limitations on use of French territory and
                            airspace, and the Soviet build-up in the Mediterranean. The specific
                            military contributions of the Spanish bases are the following.</p>
                        <p>1. The facility at Rota provides a naval operating base for nine
                            ballistic missile submarines operating continuously in the Mediterranean
                            and the North Atlantic. These boats form part of the alert element of
                            our strategic retaliatory forces, and as such are essential to the
                            nuclear deterrent. In our judgment, the only real alternative to Rota
                            would be <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> basing, but to provide
                            the same number of boats on station from a CONUS base would require an
                            additional two to four boats in the force, having a 10-year incremental
                            cost of at least $500 million.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>2. Rota also provides logistic support for surface naval elements
                            transiting the area, including underway replenishment ships for the
                            Sixth Fleet. Facilities at Rota have a capacity to provide 45% of the
                            Sixth Fleet's ammunition requirements and 17% of the <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>. While these stores might be relocated
                            elsewhere on the northern shore of the Mediterranean, such a move would
                            have the disadvantage of increasing our political dependence on Greece,
                            Italy, and Portugal.</p>
                        <p>3. Rota also provides a staging base for airborne [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] reconnaissance, a
                            major communications relay, and [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source
                                text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>4. The air base at Torrejon provides the permanent station for three USAF
                            fighter squadrons committed to missions at forward bases in Italy and
                            Turkey and partly deployed in these forward areas. The forward bases
                            have inadequate facilities for maintaining and housing the full
                            squadrons, especially the personnel and their families. Availability of
                            the Spanish complex has thus provided a feasible alternative to basing
                            these squadrons in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>, which
                            requires more aircraft to meet the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] mission in Italy and Turkey.
                            Also, 400 MAC sorties per month are now handled at Torrejon, which
                            represents 75% of the airlift load formerly handled at Chateauroux,
                            France.</p>
                        <p>5. The air bases at Torrejon, Moron, and Zaragoza are required by
                            fighter, tanker and bomber aircraft deploying from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> in execution of any one of several
                            US contingency plans for the use of US forces in Europe and the Middle
                            East. These bases are used to support tanker aircraft to refuel
                            deploying fighters and bombers, and to receive the deploying aircraft
                            for enroute stops including necessary refueling, maintenance, arming if
                            required, and crew rest. The restricted availability of French airspace
                            and the political uncertainty of US access to bases in the Azores and
                            Greece and along the southern shore of the Mediterranean will make our
                            access to Spanish bases of great military importance for these missions,
                            until at least 1972; at that time, the advent of the C-5 aircraft may
                            reduce our reliance on intermediate bases between <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> and the ultimate point of
                            destination in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>6. The base at Zaragoza, now in stand-by condition, also offers an
                            alternative to Wheelus <gloss target="#t_AFB1">AFB</gloss> as a gunnery
                            range and weapons training center, in the event we should leave Wheelus.
                            All other range possibilities (in Turkey, Italy, Sicily, Portugal and
                            Corsica) are now used by our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies and are overcrowded. There is a generally acknowledged shortage
                            of air training areas in Europe, as evidenced by the German construction
                            program in Portugal and the extensive German training in the US. It is
                            both cheaper and more effective to accomplish <gloss target="#t_USAFE1">USAFE</gloss> tactical air training in Europe than in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>, and the training <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0449"/>is extremely important to the combat
                            effectiveness of our European air forces. Training in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> would cost perhaps an added $25
                            million per year; moreover, the crews would be carried in transports,
                            hence could not train in their own tactical aircraft; this factor would
                            lower the value of the training.</p>
                        <p>7. The air bases in Spain were originally built for <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> operations, and <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> still has contingency plans for their use. These
                            involve the prestrike forward deployment of some B-58 bombers and
                            accompanying tankers, the post-strike recovery for a few
                            B-52's [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>8. Spain is now a nodal point for US military communications, carrying
                            about 8.4% of the trans-Atlantic channels and 11.1% of the channels
                            connecting the Mediterranean area with Germany and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. While communications satellites will
                            gradually reduce our reliance on relay stations in Spain, the present
                            facilities there will continue to constitute major components of the
                            world-wide defense communications system until 1972.</p>
                        <p>Taking into account the foregoing factors, the Defense Department
                            considers an extension of the Spanish Base Agreements for another five
                            years to be of great importance to the military security of the United
                            States. In addition, it would seem highly desirable to maintain
                            meaningful political-military ties with Spain during a transitional
                            period which could involve significant changes in Spanish political life
                            and in Spain's relationships to Western Europe. A continued
                            US presence could be a factor for moderation, and could facilitate the
                            development of broader and more harmonious Spanish relations with
                                Europe.<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">In a July 9 response, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that the defense

                        <p>3. Balance of Payment Program:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> repeated previous
                            Spanish complaints about classification of Spain as Schedule C country
                            referring to highly unfavorable Spanish trade balance with US and
                            Spanish status as deficit country. He claimed that US investment in
                            Spain had declined drastically. <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> said that US must find ways to redress
                            injustice committed to Spain. He said he hoped Joint Economic Committee
                            would be helpful in finding solution. Secretary did not hold out any
                            hope for reclassification. He explained that stability of the dollar and
                            the US balance of payments deficit were serious matters and of concern
                            not only to the US but to Spain and the rest of the Free World. He
                            requested factual information on the practical effect of US measures on
                            Spanish economy.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> inquired about status
                            of his request for credit for military equipment purchases. Secretary
                            replied that there were problems with Congress concerning military sales
                            and the use of Ex-Im Bank credits and that no decision had been made yet
                            on the Spanish request. He promised to let them know shortly.</p>
                        <p>4. Renewal of Bases Agreement:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> acknowledged that with
                            forthcoming elections and worldwide commitment, this was not most
                            propitious time for US to negotiate. He said that Spanish also had
                            problems and that bases were less popular in Spain than heretofore. He
                            indicated that Spain wished a security agreement comparable to the one
                            contained in the treaty with Japan, and that it could not sign the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> until it had some security
                            guarantees. Secretary replied that the Joint Declaration of 1963 was big
                            step forward and emphasized that circumstances were not good at the
                            present for a more formal type of guarantee and that we would have major
                            difficulties with Congress. He pointed out that the sacrifices presently
                            being made by the American people in life and material constituted a
                            demonstration of US fidelity to our commitments throughout the world.
                            With respect to the level of mutual assistance to Spain, both Secretary
                            and Acting Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> explained that the Spanish list for military
                            equipment assistance delivered recently was far beyond our capabilities
                            and that Congressional approval was required before any assistance could
                            be granted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> said that Spanish
                            request was reasonable and that Spain needed something tangible if US
                            wanted to keep bases and renew agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would send shortly some people to Spain
                            for on-the-spot survey of Spanish military needs. <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> thanked him and emphasized
                            again need to move quickly with program of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> asked whether US wanted
                            to keep all bases or reduce some. He said that US base at Torrejon was
                            alarming to the three million inhabitants of Madrid, and that US should
                            give firm indication on future need for all bases quickly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied we would inform the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss>
                            as soon as possible when a determination had been made and that we would
                            take <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> views on this question into
                            consideration. He said that the administration contemplated no
                            significant reductions in Spain.</p>
                        <p>5. Revision of Technical Agreement:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> was not happy with the US draft. He
                            specifically referred: 1. provisions concerning jurisdiction over
                            military tourists; 2. providing land on cost-free basis; and 3. question
                            of payment for residual value of permanent facilities at the bases.</p>
                        <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>6. Gibraltar:</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister repeated usual arguments for decolonization and referred
                            to existing UN resolutions to which US should adhere. He stressed that
                            there was great sensitivity in Spain on this subject. The Secretary
                            indicated that we did not intend to become involved in the matter but
                            suggested that Spain might usefully seek to woo the Gibraltarians.
                            Castiella replied that Spain had made a very generous offer but that no
                            progress had been made with the British towards decolonization. He said
                            Spain would not use force but had other means of pressure at her
                            disposal and would apply them.</p>
                        <p>7. Mauritania:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> gave the Secretary a
                            message from the Mauritanian Foreign Minister.<note n="4" xml:id="d210fn4">Not found.</note> Mauritania had expressed a desire
                            to resume diplomatic relations with the US and had asked the Spanish
                            Foreign Minister to sound out US reaction. The Secretary replied that he
                            would check into the question immediately and give the Foreign Minister
                            an official <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> reply to transmit to the
                            Mauritanians.</p>
                        <p>8. North Africa:</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that progress was being made on the
                            decolonization of Ifni through negotiations with Morocco and talks had
                            started. He said <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> hoped to solve the
                            question within the next few weeks and that he hoped Ifni could be
                            returned to Morocco within a few months.</p>
                        <p>Spain had good relations with Morocco and Algeria and had notably
                            improved relations with Libya. Tunisia had just received a $20 million
                            credit loan from Spain.</p>
                        <p>9. Equatorial Guinea:</p>
                        <p>He referred also to progress made towards independence for Equatorial
                            Guinea and emphasized that this was another example of Spanish good
                            faith on decolonization question. He said independence would probably be
                            granted by October 12.</p>
                        <p>10. At the Foreign Minister's request the Secretary outlined
                            briefly the present status of US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            relations and gave his assessment of the status of the Paris talks on
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>11. At conclusion Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> agreed that there was much work left to be
                            done on base renewal and that there was need to keep in close
                            contact.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he hoped we could aim for final negotiation in September
                            but that we should not be idle in the meantime and keep working on the
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                        <p>This is in reply to your letter of August 8 concerning our bases in
                                Spain.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">In his letter, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested closing Torrejon Air
                                Force Base. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> Files: Lot
                                74 D 355)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your suggestion that we attempt to break out of our studies on cost
                            reductions in Europe those portions relating to possible US force
                            reductions in Spain is a reasonable one. It may, however, present some
                            difficulties, since deployments in Spain are related to considerations
                            of our overall military posture in Europe, and more particularly to the
                            question of our tactical air capability on the southeast flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in the western Mediterranean.
                            Nevertheless, we will do our best to reach decisions with regard to
                            Spain in advance of your next discussion with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>.</p>
                        <p>You requested in particular that we give consideration to closing the air
                            base at Torrejon, in view of <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>'s expressed concern over the
                            proximity of that base to Madrid. While we are examining proposals for
                            closure or reduction to standby status of Moron Air Force Base, near
                            Seville, we have only been considering reductions in the level of our
                            military population at Torrejon. I believe there are significant
                            obstacles to closing Torrejon. The most important point is that it is
                            our best base in Spain. It is far better equipped than the other bases
                            in terms of communications equipment, administrative buildings, and a
                            wide range of support facilities that relate directly to the staging of
                            tactical and transport aircraft through Spain and to the headquarters
                            requirements of the 16th Air Force. If we were to move the major
                            elements at Torrejon to another base, it would require construction of
                            additional communications, administrative, and support facilities, as
                            well as considerable additional housing. The cost and time factors
                            involved would depend upon the alternate base selected as an adequate
                            substitute. At the present time the estimates on expense range from $10
                            to 20 million, exclusive of housing costs, but further study is required
                            before any confidence can be felt in these figures. The moving costs
                            would be substantially less if we returned the 401st Tactical Fighter
                            Wing from Torrejon to <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>, but, as
                            Nick Katzenbach pointed out in his letter to <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName> of July 22,<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">Not
                                found.</note> it <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0454"/>could have
                            serious political implications because of its effect on our tactical air
                            capability on the southeast flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in the western Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Let me add that <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>'s concern about our presence at
                            Torrejon does not appear to be shared throughout the Spanish government.
                            The Spanish military, in particular, have made no objection to our
                            presence there. Moreover, Torrejon is a principal operating base of the
                            Spanish Air Force, and they would probably wish to continue to use it.
                            If we left, they would have to pay the operating costs.</p>
                        <p>We are making progress in our preparations for negotiations in September.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> equipment package has now been
                            developed, and the Under Secretary of the Air Force, Tim Hoopes, has
                            discussed it with <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName>. I
                            understand that State has agreed that the equipment package constitutes
                            a point of departure for our negotiations with the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>While I believe it would be well for the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> to consider in general the possibility
                            of military reductions in Spain, I think that any detailed discussions
                            of this matter should be confined to State-Defense channels.</p>
                        <p>As I believe you know, I have charged Tim Hoopes with principal <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> responsibility for the Spanish base
                            negotiations. He and Ralph Earle, the Principal Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary for International Security Affairs, will continue to deal with
                            your staff on the particulars of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            will discuss negotiating position Spanish bases September 5. After
                            consideration we must seek <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0455"/>White House concurrence on agreed inter-agency position to enable
                            Secretary to discuss terms with Castiella. To accomplish this, earliest
                            meeting date would be September 16.</p>
                        <p>2. We foresee no difficulties with arrival of legal mission to discuss
                            technical agreement September 3 or 4 and believe that it would be
                            mutually advantageous to start legal talks on basis of existing
                            proposals and counter-proposals. We see no need at this point to send a
                            written U.S. response to latest Spanish counter proposals.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe that no useful purpose could be achieved by further
                            meetings with a Spanish military mission until Secretary has had chance
                            to present to <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> the

                        <p>The Chairman congratulated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> on the contingency plan for Czechoslovakia.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">See <ref target="frus1964-68v17#d23">

                                    Document 23</ref>.</note> The scenario and timing of the crisis
                            had, of course, not been foreseen, and many of the contingency draft
                            telegrams and papers had to be modified. But <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>'s preparatory work had been most helpful
                            during the first few days of the crisis. It provided a checklist of what
                            had to be done and first drafts for many of the messages and papers. It
                            would have been impossible for the Department to gear up so quickly for
                            the crisis without this earlier work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> then invited Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> to review the points at
                            issue in the forthcoming base rights negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that the Spanish
                            Foreign Minister was now definitely scheduled to meet with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on September 16. It was
                            essential that the United States Government have a clear position on the
                            outstanding issues by that date.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Security Guarantees Toward Spain</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said that the Spanish
                            wished to strengthen the degree of assurance and commitment they felt
                            was provided by the 1963 Joint Declaration.</p>
                        <p>A subcommittee of the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> had thoroughly
                            reviewed all the possibilities for strengthening the language of the
                            Declaration. The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> had reviewed these
                            possible changes and had concluded that none of them would satisfy the
                                Spanish.<note n="3" xml:id="d213fn3">

                            the <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0457"/>position that the wording
                            of the 1963 Declaration was the best we could offer and try to avoid
                            opening up this matter.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> agreed that the 1963 Declaration
                            represented the maximum we could offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> took the view that, if for public relation
                            reasons, the Spanish should insist on minor wording changes, we should
                            be willing to consider them provided these changes would not
                            substantively strengthen the language of the Declaration. As a practical
                            matter, if <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> should put
                            forward alternative language, we would have no choice but to consider
                            his proposals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Economic Relations</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said the second issue
                            between the Spanish and ourselves was their treatment under the United
                            States direct investment control program and, more generally, under our
                            balance of payments program.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish consider their classification in Schedule C discriminatory in
                            view of their weak balance of payments position and relatively
                            under-developed economy in relation to the rest of Europe. We have
                            agreed to set up a Consultative Economic Committee but we have no
                            intention to change Spain's classification under the program
                            or to provide further exemptions from the IET.</p>
                        <p>We will continue to take the position that there is no evidence our
                            balance of payments program has significantly affected the level of
                            United States investment in Spain. The recent drop in United States
                            investment activity would have occurred even in the absence of tighter
                            balance of payment controls. It reflects the fact that United States
                            companies operating in Spain have completed their expansion programs for
                            the time being.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> agreed that:</p>
                        <p>—We would have no proposals to make for dealing with the
                            subject; and,</p>
                        <p>—We cannot weaken the balance of payments program in order to
                            smoothe the course of the base rights negotiations.</p>

                            Negotiations</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> observed that a
                            concurrent, related but separate, issue between ourselves and Spain was
                            the renegotiation of the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>. A
                            subcommittee of the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> had prepared the
                            United States position for these negotiations. The general conclusion
                            was that we should go as far as we can to meet legitimate Spanish
                            demands for better terms. The bench-mark for the United States
                            negotiating position, generally speaking, was the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>s with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, including the supplemental agreement with
                            the Federal Republic. We should not draw on the Far Eastern <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>s as a model.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> took note of some of the key
                            issues including military tourism, unusual punishment, and reciprocal
                            rights. There was agreement that we were unable to meet Spanish requests
                            on this latter issue <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0458"/>in view of
                            the delicate problems this would raise in the area of State-Federal
                            relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Military Assistance Package</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> reviewed the history of

                            the credits would be primarily for the purchase of new equipment not
                            available on our excess list, whereas grant assistance would be drawn
                            from second-hand excess stocks and required new appropriations in a
                            range of $40 to $60 million. He noted the two qualifications to the
                            United States offer of $100 million in credits—viz:</p>
                        <p>1) That commercial bank credits for military equipment purchases,
                            inasmuch as they were discountable by the lending bank with Ex-Im, would
                            be counted towards the $100 million ceiling; and,</p>
                        <p>2) That, if the Spanish should take up all or part of the $55 million
                            available from Ex-Im until September 26, these amounts would also be
                            chargeable against the ceiling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> then discussed the
                            problem of funding. As regards <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969,
                            he noted that there might be a need for up to $8 to $10 million in newly
                            appropriated funds. There were several possibilities for dealing with
                            this requirement:</p>
                        <p>—To find money in the shrunken <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriation;</p>
                        <p>—To go for a supplemental after January;</p>
                        <p>—To pick and choose items that require no rehabilitation or
                            can be readily rehabilitated in Spain. On balance, the question of when
                            we start the grant program would probably not be critical and the
                            Spanish would appreciate our problem if we should find it necessary to
                            defer new grant aid until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70.</p>
                        <p>The question was raised whether we would not do well to start out with a
                            lower figure than our maximum position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said that he felt
                            this tactical question should be left to the judgment of the
                            negotiators.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish would either take our package or delay in order to negotiate
                            with the next Administration. We should adhere to a figure of about $100
                            million grant even if the Spanish should refuse to accept it. This was,
                            however, not to foreclose the possibility of a figure somewhat lower or
                            higher if, on this basis, we should be able to conclude the
                            negotiations. He was convinced that the United States would for some
                            such figure be able to negotiate an extension of the agreement. He was
                            not sure, however, that the Spanish would be willing to conclude an
                            extension on this basis with the present Administration. A quick
                            negotiation was in our interest-but the Spanish, for their part, could,
                            if they wished, delay to have another try with the next
                            Administration.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>The point was made that the arguments in favor of a quick negotiation
                            should be covered in the Memorandum to the President.</p>
                        <p>On Congressional consultations, it was agreed that these consultations
                            would have to be carried out immediately and that we would not be able
                            to wait until completion of Congressional action on the military
                            assistance legislation because the President would not approve a United
                            States offer without Congressional soundings. It was also agreed that
                            these consultations should focus on the package rather than the problem
                            of funding. Funding, if mentioned at all, should be treated lightly at
                            the end of the consultations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Statement About United States Presence</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> observed that it
                            would be helpful to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            to be able to say something about intentions in regard to a
                            consolidation or reduction of our military presence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that this matter
                            was under review. We were planning to stay at Torrejon but there was the
                            possibility that we might wish to transfer our operations from Moron.
                            Such a consolidation of our air force operations at Torrejon, if it
                            should be decided on, would result in some reduction of personnel. We
                            would do this without a reduction of our combat and combat support
                            capabilities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> indicated
                            that the Secretary of Defense might wish to move toward a decision on
                            this matter in the next 30 to 90 days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rostow raised the question of timing of a public announcement in
                            light of the events in Czechoslovakia. There was agreement that even
                            though the planned consolidations would not reduce our capabilities, we
                            would have this factor in mind in working out a possible announcement on
                            this matter.</p>

                            rights agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            meets with the Spanish Foreign Minister on Monday, September 16, to
                            discuss the renewal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName>, Joe Barr, Charlie
                            Zwick, and Walter Sauer, acting head of the Ex-Im Bank concur in the
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Our agreement with Spain covers a naval base for Polaris-armed nuclear
                            submarines and two air bases. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> believes that we will continue to need a base
                            position in Spain over the next five years, but that we should be able
                            to consolidate the two air bases and close down one of them.</p>
                        <p>Our first base agreement with Spain was made in 1953. The present
                            agreement was renegotiated in 1963. It expires this September 27, but
                            provides for a 6-month consultation period beyond that date. We have
                            nothing to gain from deferring the negotiations, however, since we need
                            the bases. Postponement would probably put Spain in a better position to
                            press for a higher price.</p>
                        <p>The recommended package comes down to the following:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Grant aid</hi>, drawn largely from excess
                            stocks, with a “fair value” of $100 million but
                            requiring budget funds (for rehabilitating the equipment) of $40 to $60
                            million over the 5-year period. (In the last agreement we gave the
                            Spanish $100 million in new military equipment, paid entirely from
                            budget money.)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Ex-Im credits or guarantees</hi>, under
                            normal terms, of $100 million for purchases of military equipment. (The
                            Spanish bought about $180 million in military equipment from us during
                            the past five years. They paid cash or financed commercially. Their
                            financial position was <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0461"/>stronger
                            than it is now, so they did not take advantage of our offer to provide
                            some Ex-Im credits.)</p>
                        <p>This package will be far below what the Spanish request. We would tell
                            them, however, that we also propose to close down one of our bases. This
                            will help them domestically to accept the lower price. It helps us by
                            cutting our goals.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish also request:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">A security treaty with us</hi> such as we
                            have with Japan. We refused this in the last negotiations and will do so
                            again. We would go no further than the existing Joint Declaration of our
                            common interests that went with the 1963 agreement. (The Joint
                            Declaration is shown at Annex in State's memo.)</p>
                        <p>—Exemption from the direct investment controls of our balance
                            of payments program. We will say no.</p>
                        <p>Congressional consultations do not indicate any serious difficulties on
                            the Hill:</p>
                        <p>—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul Nitze</persName> were in touch with
                            Senator Russell and Congressmen Mahon and Rivers. Russell had some
                            question about the price but was sympathetic; Mahon approved; and Rivers
                            gave his enthusiastic and unqualified endorsement of the package and
                            said we should get on with the agreement.</p>
                        <p>—Bill Macomber and his people spoke to Senator Hickenlooper
                            (regretted we had to pay anything but recognized the need); Senator
                            Sparkman (bases important, price not too high); Congressman
                            Frelinghuysen (saw need, hoped we could negotiate it at the price). They
                            also heard from the following:</p>
                        <p>Senator Mansfield—does not like a deal with Spain but goes
                            along on security grounds and is pleased we may be able to close down
                            one of the bases.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen and Congressmen Albert and Edna Kelly saw no
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Ford was ill, but his staff did not see any trouble.</p>
                        <p>I believe the package makes sense and that we should go ahead with the
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I refer to your letter of August 8 concerning a possible reduction of the
                            US military presence in Spain, and to my reply on August 17<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">See <ref target="#d211fn2">Document 211 and
                                    footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> would do its best to reach a decision with regard to
                            this matter in advance of your forthcoming meeting with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> on September 16. I
                            am aware of the Spanish Ambassador's recent proposal to us
                            that, if we are unable to meet fully Spain's requests for
                            military equipment, we should consider a reduction in our military
                            presence as a means of helping the Spanish government to accept an
                            extension of the Base Agreement; and I have noted the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> conclusion<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> that a statement
                            concerning our intentions on future force levels is probably essential
                            to such a Spanish acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Bearing these several factors in mind, we have studied the matter
                            intensively within <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> and have now
                            reached certain tentative conclusions; these would permit you to advise
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> along
                            the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. The US is currently studying its European deployments; while no
                            decisions have yet been made, we do anticipate some reductions and
                            consolidations of noncombat activities.</p>
                        <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>2. Within a program of consolidations and reductions, we would anticipate
                            placing one more of the bases in Spain in standby status, comparable to
                            the present status of Zaragoza; this would probably be Moron. Such a
                            move would involve personnel reductions of about 4500, approximately
                            half of whom would be civilian employees and dependents.</p>
                        <p>3. We would anticipate the continued use of Torrejon at approximately the
                            present level of activity.</p>
                        <p>4. We have sympathetically considered your expressed concern about
                            Torrejon, but have concluded that there are serious obstacles to its
                            closure. It is far better equipped than the other bases in terms of
                            communications equipment, administrative buildings, and a wide range of
                            support facilities. Any attempt to move present activities from Torrejon
                            to one of the other bases would cost the United States a good deal of
                            money and time; and in view of our present stringencies, the requirement
                            to fund such a move might well affect adversely the grant-sales package
                            we are proposing to strengthen the Spanish armed forces. Moreover, if
                            the United States should leave Torrejon and the Spanish Air Force wishes
                            to continue to use that base, the Spanish government would of course
                            have to pick up the operating costs.</p>
                        <p>5. We will consult with you further as we approach decisions on these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>I hope these suggestions will be helpful to you in your meeting with the
                            Spanish Foreign Minister.</p>

                        <p>1. Secretary, heading U.S. group of negotiators, met for three hours with
                            Spanish group, led by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> regarding renewal of Base Agreement scheduled
                            to expire September 26. Foreign Minister termed our offer of hardware
                            package of $100 million aid and $100 million official credits as
                            extremely low but agreed to have the contents of the package discussed
                            further with Pentagon officials tomorrow, September 17.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">The memorandum of conversation is ibid.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> also said that for the
                            reduction of U.S. presence to be meaningful Torrejon rather than Moron
                            should be deactivated but again agreed to have this matter further
                            discussed between the Spanish military and Pentagon officials
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>2. Foreign Minister made his usual plea for an increased security
                            commitment and Aguirre referred to the bilateral agreement between U.S.
                            and Iran as an example. Secretary said he would look into the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>3. Finally, Spanish delegation, as on previous occasions, complained
                            about the “discriminatory” inclusion of Spain in
                            Schedule C of the President's balance of payments program. No
                            concrete example of “discrimination” was offered.
                            Under Secretary Deming agreed that Treasury would meet with the Spanish
                            economic members of the negotiating team September 17 to discuss this
                            matter further.</p>
                        <p>4. When we mentioned the Technical Agreement negotiations presently being
                            held in Madrid, <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName>
                            displayed little interest and referred to them as marginal.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told the Foreign
                            Minister he would be available for further discussions at any time
                            during the week and the Foreign Minister said he would return after the
                            discussions with the Pentagon and Treasury had been concluded.</p>
                        <p>6. The general impression is that the Spanish, after some haggling, will
                            be ready to extend the Agreement for another five years.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the problem facing us was the renewal of
                            the base agreements. We were talking about the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Torrejon—the importance of this base was so great that
                            there was no need to further mention it;</p>
                        <p>2. Zaragoza presently in caretaker status;</p>
                        <p>3. Moron, which was important; and</p>
                        <p>4. Rota, which probably was the most important of all U.S. bases.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">3 paragraphs (21 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>In addition to all this, the U.S. has the full cooperation and friendship
                            of the Spanish people and their military. This [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Spain cooperated during
                            the Palomares accident in keeping it as quiet as possible. The Foreign
                            Minister said he just wanted to mention all this to let the Secretary
                            know what Spain offers and that all this should be compared with the
                            U.S. offer of 1968. What is Spain receiving for all these risks? The
                            Foreign Minister said that all the U.S. offered was around $20 million
                            per year. Perhaps by some tough negotiations this could be increased to
                            30 or even 40 million dollars, mainly in used equipment, some of it with
                            very late delivery dates. On top of this the U.S. offers only a very
                            reduced security guarantee. The Foreign Minister said he could not ask
                            the Spanish people to accept this offer and if the Secretary were in his
                            shoes, he would not consider signing such a deal which does not
                            adequately reward Spain's friendship.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary replied that the U.S. valued Spanish cooperation but wanted
                            to stress that all installations we had in Spain were mutually
                            advantageous to both countries. Spain too was interested in U.S. troops
                            and the presence of the Sixth Fleet. Thanks to the Foreign
                            Minister's skill, Spain had improved her relations with the
                            European countries and with the Western Hemisphere but this improvement
                            was partly based on Spain's relationship with the U.S.. Now
                            the situation, according to the Foreign Minister, is more dangerous in
                            1968 than it was before. In that case, our presence is more valuable to
                            Spain and it is more important for Spain to have U.S. troops in Europe
                            and to have the Sixth Fleet remain in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he valued the U.S. contribution and that
                            he was aware of the protection it afforded Spain but with the protection
                            goes the increased risk for Spain. If Spain did not renew the security
                            arrangements the Sixth Fleet would remain and 250,000 men would remain
                            in Europe. Spain would at the same time not have to take any risks. The
                            Secretary said that the risk came from the enemy and that if the U.S.
                            were not present the risk would be much greater. The Secretary said that
                            in a friendly way he wanted to make it clear that he took exception to
                            the Foreign Minister's remarks. He said this was not a
                            responsible position to take.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that the U.S. also had made enormous financial
                            contributions to Spain by building the bases and moreover Spain derived
                            a considerable balance of payments advantage from the presence of our
                            troops in Spain. In other countries we have offset arrangements; we have
                            never asked Spain for one. The Secretary said that we are working under
                            the assumption that both sides would reach agreement to their best
                            mutual advantage and that there should be no fundamental qualitative
                            changes in the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had seen a draft letter prepared by Treasury
                            officials which clearly explained that our balance of payments program
                            was not working against Spain and that the levels of U.S. investment in
                            Spain were not expected to change. Spain would not derive any advantage
                            from changes in reclassification to a different schedule because the
                            Treasury had to look at all applications for Spain. The Secretary said
                            that he was willing to sign this letter. The Foreign Minister allowed
                            that he was grateful that progress had been made on this issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on the matter of military assistance he was
                            reluctant to say what he was about to say because if revealed he would
                            be in deepest trouble. We were trying our best to be as forthcoming as
                            we could to the Spanish request. The dollar figure which we gave the
                            Spanish is the highest considering what pressure we are under. Out of
                            the funds of the Department of Defense and our military assistance <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0467"/>program we must finance
                            “a hot war” in Southeast Asia, not only in Vietnam
                            but also in Thailand, Laos and Korea. We have tried through internal
                            arrangements within the Executive Branch to fund the request through the
                            Department of Defense where the budget is concealed in another budget.
                            If Spain would buy what we offer in the United Kingdom, France or the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the equipment would cost
                            between $400 and $600 million. If Spain were to manufacture it herself,
                            it would cost many billions. The Secretary said that he was certain that
                            the Spanish military and the U.S. military could work out the package
                            and that we were meeting substantially Spanish requests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there would also be severe political
                            repercussions if the U.S. and Spain were not able to reach agreement. He
                            said a number of countries important to Spain would react in a negative
                            way, for example, Turkey, Italy, Greece and Germany. These countries
                            consider an agreement between the U.S. and Spain important. Only De
                            Gaulle would be delighted. Moreover, at home we would be in deep trouble
                            with Congress because Senators would say that if we had offered an open,
                            cooperative and generous deal to Spain and if there were no agreement it
                            would be tantamount to a Spanish confiscation of bases in disguise.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he would like to remind the Secretary that
                            Spain too had made important sacrifices in the establishment of the
                            bases. Millions of dollars had been spent in expropriating land and the
                            bases had not been profitable for Spain. The Foreign Minister said he
                            appreciated the efforts made about rectifying the existing
                            discriminatory situation on the balance of payments problem by the offer
                            to issue a letter. Castiella then said that he agreed with the Secretary
                            that if no agreement were reached it would cause international concern
                            but by the same token, it would enhance Spanish prestige because it no
                            longer could be considered as a satellite of the U.S. but as a free and
                            independent country. Moreover, internally a part of the Spanish people
                            would applaud the end of the agreement if the American proposals were
                            insufficient.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that on the question of prestige Spain would have
                            to choose. Of course, Nasser, Boumedienne and Tanzania would applaud
                            non-renewal. But the prestige would go down in Western Europe, in Japan,
                            in India and even in Yugoslavia and Spain had to choose where it wanted
                            its prestige.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the possibility existed that both sides were
                            the prisoners of artificial military figures and maybe in the upcoming
                            talks we should not use figures but talk about equipment. In this way we
                            could talk about some increases in military assistance and the Spanish
                            military probably could report back that they were satisfied.</p>
                        <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that it had always been the Spanish intention
                            not to talk about figures but only about equipment because figures were
                            misleading considering that equipment could be priced in various
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the Secretary had mentioned Boumedienne
                            but that he would like to remind us that the Algerian Air Force, thanks
                            to Soviet generosity, was infinitely superior to the Spanish Air Force
                            which had obsolete equipment. He said the Spanish military were ready to
                            help the U.S. but they must be armed to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister added that in the U.S. package we offered obsolete
                            102s. Mr. Landau interjected that in the discussion with Mr. Hoopes this
                            matter had been clarified and that the U.S. Air Force was looking into
                            the possibility of furnishing 104s as requested by the Spanish.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the military should go ahead and have
                            another try at the package on Monday with a view of reaching an
                            agreement on the physical contents of the package as well as on the
                            services which could be provided by the U.S. to the Spanish Navy and to
                            the early warning system. These services were hard to translate into
                            dollars and cents.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> said that time was
                            flying and there was need for him to meet again with the Secretary to
                            talk about reduction of U.S. presence and security guarantees possibly
                            on Monday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the military group discuss the reduction of
                            U.S. presence at the time they talked about the package. Mr. Aguirre de
                            Carcer said firmly that the Spanish generals were not authorized to
                            discuss this question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then suggested that this matter be raised on the political
                            level at <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> possibly with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he would be pleased to send Under
                            Secretary Sedo on Monday to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>. The Foreign Minister again stressed that we had
                            severe time limitations and that he could not sign until he was
                            satisfied that Spanish defense needs had been met.</p>
                        <p>It was decided that the Spanish military would meet with the U.S.
                            military group headed by Mr. Hoopes on Monday and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> would see Mr. Sedo on Monday too.
                            Following these meetings, another talk would be scheduled between the
                            Secretary and the Foreign Minister.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that normally he always looked forward to
                            coming to the Department of State but that today he came to the
                            Secretary's office sadly and with a lump in his throat. For
                            several days, while in Washington, he had come to realize that no
                            progress was being made in the negotiations and that matters were
                            beginning to turn in the wrong direction. This was a painful fact, sad
                            both to the Secretary and to himself. Nevertheless, despite the
                            difficult situation he now faced, the Foreign Minister still wished to
                            thank the Secretary, Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LG1">Landau</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName>, and Colman for their hard work
                            and for having shown so much good will towards Spain.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that he wanted to summarize the situation as
                            he now saw it and to compare what Spain had to offer and what the U.S.
                            was ready to come up with in return. Spain offered four important
                            military bases, two of which were of the greatest importance for the
                            defense of the Western world. The base at Rota was the only other base
                            together with Holy Loch where nuclear-powered Polaris submarines could
                            enter. Rota's location is unique at the entrance to the
                            Mediterranean. Also there was Torrejon, headquarters of the 16th Air
                            Force, a powerful base with the longest airstrip in Europe. As a matter
                            of fact, General Burchinal had told General Munoz Grandes two or three
                            days ago that it was his hope that Torrejon might eventually become <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0470"/>the headquarters for the whole
                            U.S. Air Force in Europe. In addition to the four bases there were also
                            communications facilities, assisting the U.S. and Europe. There were a
                            number of other factors such as Colossus I and the privilege of U.S.
                            overflight rights in Spain. If it were not possible for U.S. aircraft to
                            fly freely over Spain and France, a problem would be caused for the U.S.
                            Finally, pursuant to a secret agreement, Spain did not require prior
                            consultation or notification if its bases were used in times of crisis.
                            Spain is the only sovereign state that has gone so far in granting such
                            valuable privileges.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that it is not the fault of Spain that they are
                            faced with such pressure of time and that such serious matters had to be
                            discussed during the brief period of September 16 to September 26. There
                            still exists a very big gap between the Spanish request and the U.S.
                            counter-offer. The U.S. has offered some $20 million of military
                            assistance per year and a line of credit of $100 million. On the other
                            hand, Spain had listed its needs not in terms of money but in terms of
                            actual requirements. The Foreign Minister stated that he wanted to table
                            the latest Spanish proposal prepared by his military team which,
                            although not expressed in terms of dollars and cents, should amount to
                            about $500 to $600 million. It was indeed a drama that U.S. inability to
                            provide Spain with $100 million of equipment per year would liquidate a
                            friendship and an alliance. Next March the U.S. might have to start
                            dismantling its bases and what was really painful was to see how much
                            harm could be done to a cooperation and friendship that had developed
                            over a 15-year period.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated the news of this situation would be known
                            around the world and that it would harm U.S. prestige in other
                            countries. Greece, Turkey, and Italy have bases in the Mediterranean
                            where they deny use of their facilities to Polaris nuclear submarines.
                            These countries will be happy about the Spanish gesture because it will
                            make their contribution more valuable in the future. There will be a
                            quick and strong reaction on the part of the press. Regrettably, by
                            looking at newspaper articles and editorials in the U.S. press, one
                            could see that there was a lack of knowledge with regard to
                            Spain's real contribution to Western defense. The American
                            press usually dismisses the four bases in a cursory manner and neglects
                            to take into account the communications centers, and the overflight
                            rights. Spain would continue to be a friend of the U.S. but it hurt the
                            Foreign Minister deeply to see how the U.S. could be harmed by the
                            present situation.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that he could not understand why the U.S.
                            could not come up with $100 million a year for these bases when the U.S.
                            had a total defense budget of $72 billion. He said he felt that $100
                            million was a ridiculously low sum. He said that he did not know exactly
                            how much could be purchased with $100 million or whether <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0471"/>in fact the bases were worth that
                            amount in terms of the defense of the free world. Spain had asked for
                            this figure not because of blackmail but because it needed that level of
                            assistance to cover its defense needs and, furthermore, Spain was
                            willing to make its own contribution to the defense of the free world.
                            The Czech crisis and other recent events had underlined once more the
                            importance of conventional armies. While a country such as Denmark could
                            contribute only several thousand troops to the common defense, Spain had
                            120 thousand men in uniform and in case of need could contribute half a
                            million men to the defense of the West. But in the face of such offers
                            there seemed to be no attempt on the part of the U.S. to attach great
                            value to Spain's contribution. It appeared as if the U.S.
                            wanted to defend the entire world alone and as if only U.S. lives could
                            be committed to the defense of a civilization, which Spain also wanted
                            to defend. Offering lives and taking risks was something that could not
                            be evaluated in monetary terms and, therefore, $100 million was truly a
                            ridiculously low sum. Spain refused to trade human lives in return for
                            an insufficient package. Spain wants to make its contribution to the
                            defense of Europe and of the West. While it was true that the U.S. had
                            suffered 350,000 casualties since World War II, Spain's
                            anti-communist stand had cost half a million lives during its bloody
                            civil war.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish military team had found the American military representatives
                            to be very unbending during their last meeting, which was a very short
                            one, and the U.S. counter-offer remained basically unchanged. The
                            Foreign Minister said he had remained in Washington hoping that tension
                            would decrease. On Sunday, the Foreign Minister had called Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG1">Landau</persName> to the Spanish Embassy (and he
                            thanked him for coming so promptly) to describe some of the difficulties
                            that he faced in view of the rapidly approaching deadline. The Spanish
                            Council of Ministers was to meet on September 24 and the Spanish Chief
                            of State was to leave Madrid on September 25. The Foreign Minister had
                            said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LG1">Landau</persName> that he and his
                            military advisers had to report to the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> on the course of the negotiations by Monday night. In
                            response to his report, the Spanish Government had met and had sent him
                            the following cable:</p>
                        <p>At the Cabinet meeting on September 24 the Spanish Government has studied
                            the position of the United States. The decisions of the Spanish Cabinet
                            are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. offer of military assistance as presented on September 23 is
                            totally unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>2. The Spanish minimum requirement cannot be reduced any further.</p>
                        <p>3. The Spanish Government cannot consider any alternate formulae through
                            readjustment of the U.S. military presence in Spain.</p>
                        <p>4. In view of U.S. inability to meet the Spanish request, the Spanish
                            Government wishes to apply the procedure provided by Article V of the
                            Defense Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>5. The Spanish Government authorizes the Foreign Minister to seek with
                            the Secretary of State a jointly-agreed presentation to the press.</p>
                        <p>The last point was the only concession the Foreign Minister had been able
                            to obtain from his Government to enable him to try to present the best
                            possible picture to the press in the midst of this catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked the Foreign Minister on behalf of his colleagues
                            and of himself for the Foreign Minister's very friendly
                            remarks about their own role. He said he esteemed the Foreign
                            Minister's able diplomatic expertise very highly. First of
                            all, the Secretary expressed regret at the conclusions reached by the
                            Spanish Council of Ministers. It was apparent that if the procedures
                            provided for in Article V were now invoked, some serious problems would
                            arise for both sides. From the diplomatic point of view, it was
                            necessary to take note of the fact that the U.S. was in the midst of an
                            election period and it was impossible to know at the present time who
                            the next President would be and what the political composition of the
                            next Congress might be. If Article V were to go into effect right away,
                            the next Administration would only have two months for consultations
                            while at the same time it would have to organize itself and look at some
                            major problems, including the matter of negotiations with Spain.
                            Secondly, it would be important to explain to the peoples of both
                            countries why an agreement had not been reached. From that point on
                            Spain and the U.S. would be following diverging paths. Regardless of
                            what the explanations to the press might be, relations between Spain and
                            the U.S. would begin to deteriorate. What the Spanish Government and the
                            U.S. told their respective press and people would probably lead to a
                            number of different interpretations and this was a problem that should
                            not be minimized. It would probably result in a bad press for Spain in
                            the U.S. and also for a bad press for the U.S. in Spain. While it was
                            difficult to see the bearing of all of this on U.S. and Spanish
                            prestige, it was clear to see that it would damage both sides. Its
                            effect on Spain would be serious because Spain's prestige had
                            risen in recent years, partly due to its good relations with the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the Foreign Minister had had a chance to
                            consult with his Council of Ministers but since the Secretary did not
                            know what Spain's latest reaction would be, he had not
                            consulted with his own colleagues in the Cabinet or with the President.
                            He would like to have a chance to do so before he gave a final reply to
                            the Foreign Minister. He added that he would like to suggest to the
                            Foreign Minister that, to avoid the negative consequences resulting from
                            the invocation of Article V, he ask his Government for a six-month
                            extension of the Agreements. This would give both governments and
                            especially the new U.S. Administration enough time to analyze the
                            problems before <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0473"/>Article V was
                            invoked. He hoped that the Foreign Minister would be able to consult
                            with Madrid about this matter and to indicate its reaction as soon as
                            possible. At the same time, the Secretary would discuss the problem with
                            the President and with the Secretary of Defense. Unfortunately, the
                            Secretary had to leave for Philadelphia to make a speech and would not
                            be back until later today, but he would be at the disposal of the
                            Foreign Minister as of tomorrow morning. In any event, Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> would represent him in the meantime.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that if it were difficult to get in touch with the
                            full Council of Ministers or with the Spanish Chief of State another
                            solution might be to waive the September 26 deadline and so to speak use
                            the parliamentary procedure of stopping the clock.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that with reference to the difficulties caused
                            by the present election period that Spain had not chosen the date for
                            these negotiations and that when the Agreement was signed initially the
                            negotiators on both sides did not realize that the Agreement would
                            expire during the time of the election campaign. Spain had studied the
                            problem of the renewal for quite some time and had realized what some of
                            the difficulties might be. Nevertheless, it did not want to play up to
                            one or the other political parties in the U.S. and had always preferred
                            to deal with the U.S. on a Government-to-Government basis and hoped that
                            if there were to be a change in the Government in Spain, the U.S. would
                            also deal with Spain on the same basis.</p>
                        <p>Now that Spain was required to ask for the cancellation of the Agreement,
                            the matter of press relations became very important. The Spanish press
                            is free and not controlled, and whoever thinks otherwise is obviously
                            ill-informed. Be that as it may, the Spanish press had been silent
                            during the course of the present negotiations because the Foreign
                            Minister and his team had not sent out any information and there had
                            been no leaks on the Spanish side. The press had reported just the fact
                            that meetings had been held but had not divulged any of the substance.
                            The Foreign Minister would now have to make the necessary efforts to
                            inform the Spanish press, the world, and American public opinion of what
                            had happened in connection with the bases and with the Agreement. This
                            would obviously lead to a certain reaction on the part of the press,
                            even though the Spanish Foreign Ministry would officially try to smooth
                            things over as best it could.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the subject of stopping the clock, the Government of Spain
                            and Spanish jurists had given some thought to the matter but the fact
                            was that the Agreement had been approved by the Spanish Cortes and that
                            certain legal requirements had to be met so that stopping the clock was
                            not a feasible solution. In view of this, the six-month period of
                            consultation would start tomorrow and the only possibility <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0474"/>would appear to be the issuance of a
                            joint announcement saying that the present negotiations could continue.
                            This could be done only if it were possible to see that a fruitful
                            solution would be forthcoming. The gap between $20 million and $100
                            million a year appeared to be a very rigid one, since the amounts quoted
                            by both sides seemed to be final. If the U.S. felt that it was not
                            worthwhile to pay such a price for the bases, then there was nothing
                            that could be done. If, on the other hand, the U.S. agreed that they
                            were worth the price, then it might be possible to find a formula to
                            which both sides could agree, even if negotiations then had to continue
                            for maybe another week or possibly as much as another month.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he assumed that under Article V consultations
                            would continue for as long as six months. He stated that looking back on
                            US/Spanish relations, the U.S. was now faced with a new situation
                            because of the order of magnitude of Spain's present needs
                            which bore no relation with the order of magnitude of its needs when the
                            original Agreement was signed. He added that there must be a
                            misunderstanding of our Constitutional system in the attempt to compare
                            $100 million with the total of the $72 billion defense budget. The
                            Congress appropriates funds for certain specific purposes and the $72
                            billion have been assigned to specific activities. Therefore, when it
                            comes to funds for military assistance, we are really looking at just
                            one small and restricted item in that overall budget. A great battle was
                            continuously being fought in Congress in order to avoid further
                            reductions in military aid appropriations. Finally, he stated that he
                            had made an official proposal in his capacity as Secretary of State to
                            extend the Agreement for six months and he hoped that since this was a
                            new question put to the Spanish Government, the Foreign Minister would
                            go back to his Government and submit it for its consideration. It was
                            not too late to extend the Agreement for six months or a year and,
                            therefore, he hoped that the matter would be given serious consideration
                            and that he would be able to obtain a prompt reply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that it had been
                            his impression for many years that the Agreements had mutually benefited
                            Spain and the U.S. and that the negotiations were not a matter of simply
                            evaluating the direct benefits to the U.S. or to Spain but rather to
                            recognize that both countries had worked together for their mutual
                            interests and that the U.S. had done the best it could to strengthen the
                            Spanish armed forces. Therefore, the matter should not be viewed by the
                            Spanish solely as a question of payment to Spain for the use of some
                            bases. He felt that the expression of this view would not be well
                            received by his colleagues and by members of the U.S. Senate.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the new order of magnitude of
                            Spain's needs compared to 1953 should not have come as a
                            surprise <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0475"/>since the cost of the
                            most elementary consumer items had increased considerably since 1953 in
                            every country in the world. He repeated that $100 million per year was
                            the amount that Spain needed to cover its defense needs and that the
                            U.S. Government should have foreseen such a request because it had been
                            reminded several times in the past by the Foreign Minister himself that
                            the negotiations would start soon. He added that Spain had very good
                            friends in the Senate as proven by the fact that twice the Senate had
                            asked for Spanish admission into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and as seen by attempts to fight any move to cut funds destined to
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the proposal to extend the Agreement by six months, he
                            felt that the Spanish Council of Ministers could not meet because some
                            of its members were out of town and, furthermore, that it could probably
                            not accept the proposal. Moreover, the period from September 1968 to the
                            spring of 1969 would be a very dramatic one. Spain could not stop the
                            clock just as the U.S. could not get the Russians out of the
                            Mediterranean or out of Czechoslovakia. He stated that he was not
                            refusing to continue his present round of talks but that he felt that
                            the Spanish Government would not accede to the Secretary's
                            last minute proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the Foreign Minister was not saying that
                            communications between the two governments had ceased and he suggested
                            that the American Ambassador in Madrid could see members of the Spanish
                            Government to transmit this latest proposal. He asked the Foreign
                            Minister whether he would transmit the proposal through his own channels
                            to the Government of Spain and the Foreign Minister replied that he
                            would do so but that he did not see much hope for a favorable
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would be at the disposal of the Foreign
                            Minister for additional meetings on September 26.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary stated that the six-month period of consultation pursuant
                            to Article V of the Agreement started today and that he was anxious to
                            know exactly and accurately what the Spanish requirements were for the
                            continuation of the Agreement, since he would have to report them to the
                            President and also after November 5 to the President-elect. At
                            yesterday's meeting the Spanish Foreign Minister had
                            indicated that Spain would invoke Article V and he had also tabled a new
                            list of Spanish military equipment requirements. He asked whether that
                            list was the total Spanish request or whether there were other matters.
                            He also stated that the first question which the President and the next
                            President-elect would ask would be whether it was the desire of Spain,
                            as a matter of policy, to agree to a continuation of the Agreement or
                            not.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he could say emphatically and unmistakably
                            that Spain wants to continue its friendship with the U.S. and that it
                            would be delighted to renew the Agreement on the basis of equality and
                            dignity as well as on the basis of the minimum Spanish proposal tabled
                            on September 25.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that it should be on the basis of equality and
                            dignity not only for Spain but also for the U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0477"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued saying that he was authorized to sign the
                            renewal of the Agreement today provided that the September 25 minimum
                            Spanish request were met in total. If this were not possible then Spain
                            would like to know what the position of the U.S. would be since March
                            26, 1969, was rapidly approaching and Spain would have to start thinking
                            about changes in its policies. In any event, Spain wanted to continue
                            being a good friend of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>He added that if Spain were to adopt a neutralist policy, Spain would not
                            stop being a friend of the U.S. However, his purpose and the purpose of
                            his Government was to strengthen this friendship and if the renewal was
                            not signed today, he would continue working so that agreement could be
                            reached as soon as possible, always on the basis of the minimum Spanish
                            list.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not quite understand what the contents
                            of such a neutralist policy included. Some countries in Western Europe
                            believed that they could adopt what they described as a third position
                            as if they were simply innocent spectators watching the big struggle
                            between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in Western Europe. This was not the
                            case, because Western Europe itself was the issue.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that such a new policy could be similar to
                            that of Sweden, Switzerland, and Austria, i.e. a policy of neutrality
                            and at the same time of sympathy for the U.S. Spain was not part of the
                            Western defense system because it had been excluded due to ideological
                            differences. Now the U.S. was unwilling to give Spain what it needed for
                            its defense and therefore there was no other way out for Spain but to
                            return to her traditional policy of neutrality. If the U.S. could not
                            provide Spain with the necessary arms and a minimum level of military
                            assistance, then Spain, although a poor country, would try to achieve
                            its aims on its own. It should not be too difficult to do so since for
                            example as recently as a few months ago the French Government had
                            offered Spain 50 Mirage aircraft with very generous credit provisions
                            which Spain had not even considered since it was counting on its
                            friendship with the U.S. Spain could on its own acquire a smaller amount
                            of weapons but they would be newer and they would be hers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that this might prove to be very expensive and
                            the Foreign Minister replied that might be so but that Spain would then
                            readjust the structure of its Army and make it smaller so that savings
                            resulting from personnel cuts could be channeled into the purchase of
                            better equipment. Domestic industries could be developed so that
                            military purchases in the U.S., which last year added up to $187
                            million, would be made in Spain itself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether, if the U.S. were to return to isolationism,
                            this would be in the interest of Europe and whether it would serve
                            Spain's security.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that this would probably not be so but that
                            it might prove General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            right when he said that Europe could not depend on the U.S. to defend
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that it was precisely <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName> who had made a massive contribution to an
                            increased isolationist feeling in this country and specifically on the
                            part of many Senators.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired again whether the Spanish list of military
                            equipment requirements was the only problem standing in the way of
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that there were certain economic aspects that
                            would also have to be clarified but he noted with satisfaction that the
                            letter on economic problems which had been offered to him and which
                            would be signed by the Secretary of State was a very productive step. He
                            also said that some minor changes were required in the language of the
                            mutual security guarantees. Nevertheless, the key issue was that of
                            military assistance. Yesterday, the Foreign Minister said, he had
                            received strict and clear instructions which authorized him to sign an
                            extension of the Agreement only if the Spanish minimum list were
                            accepted. If this were not possible, he had been instructed to invoke
                            the procedure established in Article V.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he had had a chance to speak with the President
                            and leaders of the Congress and that he could say that the U.S. could
                            not accept the Spanish list. Therefore, the procedures provided for in
                            Article V would come into play and both countries would keep in touch
                            about future steps. He then gave a draft joint press statement to the
                            Foreign Minister for his consideration and approval.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">For agreed text of the communiqué, see
                                Department of State Bulletin, October 14, 1968, p. 382.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked if the Secretary had talked to Congressional
                            leaders about the possibility of improving the mutual security
                            guarantees to Spain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the security problem was not something which
                            the Congress could take up as a procedural question but rather that it
                            was a matter of substance. The present Congress was to adjourn in about
                            ten days and it was not possible now to foresee what the composition of
                            the next Congress would be. Therefore, it was not practical to take up
                            the security matter within the time limitations that were now being
                            faced.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that many of the Senators in the present
                            Congress would continue in office and that preparations should be made
                            to keep them informed and that the problem should be discussed with
                            them. He said that his only complaint was that he had warned <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0479"/>the Secretary back in October and
                            November of 1967<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">See <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note> that all these problems would be
                            coming up and that at the time he had urged that in 1968 there should
                            not be a repetition of the anguished race against time that had occurred
                            in 1963. He repeated that it was not Spain's fault that the
                            conversations had been delayed for so long but that he deplored it
                            nevertheless.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was well aware that the Foreign Minister
                            had raised these questions a long time ago and that there had been many
                            contacts with Congressional leaders over the last months. The
                            conclusions which he had given the Foreign Minister were the final
                            positions arrived at after lengthy discussions with many leaders and he
                            therefore could not accept the suggestion that the U.S. had in any way
                            been negligent in its duties. Some Congressmen may have stated their own
                            personal views in the course of the last months but it is really the
                            leadership of the Congress and the corporate views of that body which
                            should be considered. He said some foreign embassies have at times been
                            confused by statements of individual Congressmen but it so happened that
                            at the present time it was not possible to foresee what the corporate
                            attitude of the next Congress or of the next President might be. All the
                            Secretary could do was to describe the situation as he saw it today and
                            as the present Congress also saw it today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that all of the
                            Senators and Congressmen with whom the Department of Defense had dealt
                            on these matters felt that the position of the U.S. was correct and fair
                            and that it was consistent with what they believed were the Spanish
                            needs at the present time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the U.S. would now proceed on the basis that
                            it would like the Agreements extended which was also the feeling of
                            Spain. He added that both sides should concentrate on solving their
                            mutual problems during the next six months and that the U.S. would
                            continue to act with good faith and with a spirit of cooperation and he
                            expressed the hope that this would lead to satisfactory results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that the Senators
                            and Congressmen concerned with Defense were fully cognizant of the
                            contribution of Spain and that they were very appreciative of them.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that if this were true, and he had no reason
                            to doubt it, then the situation was very disappointing indeed and it did
                            not offer much promise for the next six months of consultations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that the main
                            point which the American legislators kept in mind was that the present
                            Agreements were mutually beneficial. They felt that it was not right to
                            attach a monetary value to the <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0480"/>contributions which either the U.S. or Spain made and that they
                            considered the American proposal as right and proper because allies
                            should help each other and should do whatever possible to be of
                            assistance to one another. They were sure that the American offer was
                            commensurate with the needs of the Spanish armed forces especially in
                            the light of demands placed on the U.S. elsewhere and of the existing
                            limitations in funds.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that if the U.S. was not capable of giving
                            any more help than it now offered, it would be impossible to go any
                            further and therefore maybe the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss> was
                            right in denouncing the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that nothing profitable could be gained by
                            discussing further the existing gap and that it would be better to see
                            where both countries were at the present time and to lay the foundations
                            for further constructive action. He asked the Foreign Minister whether
                            the draft press statement was acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that in principle the draft was acceptable
                            but that he would like to study it and give a firm reply by 5:00 p.m.
                            today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> suggested that if there
                            were any contacts with the press, both sides should say that talks were
                            continuing. The Foreign Minister indicated that he wasn't
                            interested in seeing the press for the time being. He also stated that
                            he regretted that there had been no response to his latest proposal
                            contained in the minimum list which he had tabled yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had already indicated that he was not in a
                            position today to say that the Spanish list was acceptable.</p>

                        <p>2. At his request, Spanish <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> called on Secretary
                            October 17 ostensibly for routine protocol farewell,<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> was in New York
                                attending the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
                                meetings.</note> but conversation developed into substantive
                            exchange on renewal of bases agreement. <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> was in an extremely relaxed and cordial
                            mood.</p>
                        <p>3. After opening cordialities, Secretary asked FonMinister how one should
                            approach a resumption of negotiations on the base
                            negotiations—from a political or military point of view. The
                            FonMinister said that military aid which was basic and fundamental was
                            first and political aspects could be handled through regular diplomatic
                            procedures. There then ensued an exchange on some of the complications
                            that had developed during the earlier talks. The Secretary noted that
                            one of the problems for the US was the continuing drain caused by the
                            war in Viet-Nam and said that if that were behind us the US would have
                            been in a different budgetary position, but unfortunately war was not
                            yet behind us.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary then suggested that there were three stages which
                            resumed negotiations might take: a) The Secretary and the FonMinister
                            should reach a political agreement on the fact that as a matter of
                            general policy both Spain and US wanted the Agreement to continue in the
                            future. b) Then the best military minds of both countries should get
                            together quietly and discreetly to discuss military cooperation between
                            the two countries. (During such talks both sides would try to come up
                            with common strategic concepts which would constitute framework within
                            which US-Spanish cooperation would continue. US would not want to
                            question Spain's sovereign responsibility for its own armed
                            forces but would just discuss matter of conceivable common strategic
                            concept and the provision of military equipment from that vantage
                            point.) c) There could then be political conversations to clear up any
                            remaining bilateral military or political matters.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> enthusiastically
                            endorsed Secretary's outline and stated both countries should
                            not waste any time in setting up first contacts which should be between
                            high-level and discreet military representatives. (<persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> indicated General
                            Diez-Alegria would be a good representative for Spain.) <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> said that
                            Secretary's emphasis on concept of common strategy was of
                            greatest importance because of sensitivity of Spanish people and desire
                            to be a real part of Western defense effort. Secretary commented that in
                            terms of over-all strategic concept and security of both countries it
                            should be possible for both sides to identify their common
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary and FonMinister agreed on desirability of continuing
                            Agreement and that they should now proceed to step two. Subject to <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0482"/>agreement by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> and Spanish
                            authorities, Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> expressed hope that top level military talks
                            could start on November 15. The Secretary noted that by then US
                            elections would have taken place and views of new Administration could
                            be sought during course of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> took up the question
                            of the Secretary's letter on the balance of payments
                            situation which had been drafted in September and said that it would be
                            appreciated if the letter could be sent without being considered part of
                            the base negotiations because it would have a very powerful
                            psychological effect, even though it was not a commitment on the part of
                            the US. The Secretary promised to consider the matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">No letter has been found.</note>

                        <p>The Secretary regretted that he had been forced by illness to postpone
                            his appointment by one day and he wished to express his gratitude <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0483"/>to General Franco for accepting
                            the changed schedule. He delivered greetings from President Johnson to
                            the Spanish Chief of State and said that he did not believe the election
                            in the United States would make any difference to U.S.-Spanish
                            relations. The safety of Europe was basic to the security of the U.S.
                            and as this was a bipartisan policy he felt certain that the new
                            Administration would follow the same approach. He was equally certain
                            that the new Administration would continue the policy of esteem and
                            friendship towards Spain and he did not foresee any policy changes. He
                            said that the U.S. continued to be concerned about the situation in
                            Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Vietnam, and invited questions
                            from General Franco.</p>
                        <p>Franco said that he was greatly interested in all topics mentioned by the
                            Secretary but that he was primarily concerned with the Mediterranean
                            area. He said that the Mediterranean was of great importance to all of
                            Europe and that Spain looked with justified alarm at the continued
                            presence of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reported that he had been encouraged by the growing
                            interest of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries in the
                            Mediterranean situation, a welcome change from views expressed in
                            previous years. Not only did Turkey, Greece and France show interest,
                            but so did some of the countries more distant from the Mediterranean
                            like Belgium and Holland. The Mediterranean was more of a political than
                            a military problem—and the situation of Soviet ships in the
                            Mediterranean was similar to the position of U.S. troops in Berlin,
                            surrounded by hostile territory and cut off from their home base. The
                            Secretary referred to the possibility that the Soviets might acquire
                            base facilities and other support in Algeria and said that he had
                            mentioned this subject to the French Foreign Minister. The latter shared
                            his concern, but did not think that the Soviets had acquired any bases
                            in Algeria. France, according to Debre, was opposed to the Soviet
                            presence in Algeria and would follow the matter closely. What France
                            might do to counter a possible Soviet build-up remained a matter of
                            speculation.</p>
                        <p>General Franco said that the Mediterranean is most important to the life
                            of Europe and that the Russian presence there was a total menace to all
                            European countries and weakened the posture of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, particularly that of Greece and Turkey. He referred
                            to the southern shore of the Mediterranean as the weak link because the
                            countries located there received Soviet arms which mortgaged their
                            freedom. He compared the Soviet presence in the Mediterranean to a
                            steadily growing oil slick and said that if Soviet action in
                                Czechoslovakia<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">Reference is to the
                                August 30 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.</note> constituted a
                            menace to Central Europe and in particular Germany, the Russian presence
                            in the Mediterranean was a menace to all of Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>The Secretary assured General Franco that the U.S. had warned the
                            U.S.S.R. very strongly against any move against what the U.S.S.R. called
                            “State interests of the U.S.”, and that the
                            U.S.S.R. had assured the U.S. at the time of the invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia that there would be no infringement of those interests.
                            He said the Soviets were under no illusion about our interest in
                            countries where we have bases, or with which we have treaties or
                            agreements. Although the Russians had responded seriously to our serious
                            warning, they would have to be watched carefully because we were dealing
                            with a communist government. As General Franco was aware the U.S. has
                            the means of watching in some detail the movement of Soviet forces, but
                            as of this moment there did not seem to be any indication that a use of
                            force was contemplated or that what happened with Czechoslovakia would
                            be repeated with Romania, Austria, Yugoslavia or Albania. The Secretary
                            told Franco that we would advise Spain of any indications, as we
                            understood Spain's interest in the matter. Another matter of
                            concern was Soviet arms build-up in Egypt and Algeria and there were a
                            number of Soviet technicians in Egypt. He hoped that the Jarring mission
                            would be successful and would result in a limitation of Soviet presence
                            in Egypt. The Secretary expressed appreciation for the interest the
                            Spanish Government took in the Mediterranean situation and referred to
                            the exchange of information during the last two or three years on this
                            subject which had been of mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>General Franco asked whether the Czech situation was a result of spheres
                            of interest established in Europe between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. at
                            the end of World War II.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was just the opposite. The U.S. had agreed at Yalta
                            to popular elections under Allied Commission supervision, but Stalin,
                            behind the strength of the Red Army, simply snapped his fingers and
                            invaded Eastern Europe. He added that we had never had any agreements
                            with the U.S.S.R. about spheres of interest and that the Soviets did not
                            consult with us prior to the invasion of Czechoslovakia although we had
                            warned them twice about this matter. The fact remained, however, that
                            the Warsaw Pact and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> existed and
                            that use of force by one or the other meant war. He assured General
                            Franco that the strong American reaction over Czechoslovakia was not
                            based on friendship for the government of Czechoslovakia and that the
                            Dubcek government gave us great difficulties. Soviet arms had been
                            killing American soldiers in Vietnam. Nevertheless the U.S. wanted to
                            make clear that even a small country was entitled to work out its own
                            destiny.</p>
                        <p>General Franco wondered whether the U.S.S.R. decision to invade
                            Czechoslovakia and Hungary could have been decided on strategic grounds
                            by the Soviet Armed Forces overruling the political leaders.</p>
                        <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0485"/>
                        <p>The Secretary thought that this was possible because contrary to normal
                            procedure the political leaders of the Soviet Union kept quiet and
                            statements were made mainly by TASS, Pravda, Izvestia and on the radio.
                            It was only two days ago that Brezhnev made his first statement. It was
                            unfortunate, the Secretary said, that we had so little information and
                            that complete secrecy was kept about what happened in discussions
                            between the top Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and General Franco agreed on the strategic impact on Europe
                            made by the invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and the Secretary
                            suggested that Soviet leaders might be frightened of peaceful
                            coexistence which had brought about closer ties between Eastern and
                            Western Europe. The trend towards closer ties, however, was permanent
                            and he was sure that there would be further changes in Eastern
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>In reply to General Franco's question about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> reaction to Czechoslovakia, the
                            Secretary made these points:</p>
                        <p>—Some European countries have finally abandoned their illusion
                            about détente;</p>
                        <p>—It improved French willingness to cooperate;</p>
                        <p>—It made it possible for some countries to improve their
                            defense budgets because public and parliamentary opinion had been
                            aroused.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was
                            composed of national forces and any strengthening in the military forces
                            of an individual country would result in a strengthening of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He said he hoped that France would re-join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and added that the U.S. would hope that Spain would
                            become a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, although there
                            were some well-known difficulties.</p>
                        <p>General Franco said that the weakest parts of Soviet power were the
                            occupied countries and lack of Soviet domination over those countries
                            prevented the U.S.S.R. from attacking the West. He said it would be
                            important to encourage resistance in the occupied countries in order to
                            make it more difficult for the Russians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed and said that last June at Reykjavik he had proposed
                            mutual withdrawal.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">Reference is to the North

                                15, 1968, p. 77.</note> If the Soviet forces would leave Eastern
                            Europe development in those countries would be accelerated. The U.S.S.R.
                            unfortunately understood this, too, and had declined the suggestion.
                            Events in Czechoslovakia had been costly to the Soviet Union and he was
                            optimistic on a long range basis about development in Eastern Europe
                            notwithstanding short-run difficulties.</p>

                        <p>General Franco said that we should not forget that there was no liberal
                            movement in Czechoslovakia but only a different type of national
                            communism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed but stressed that nevertheless it gave the Czechs
                            more room to express their views. He said that even in the U.S.S.R.
                            there are groups who are no longer under Communist Party control.
                            Scientists in nuclear energy and space fields had become members of a
                            world scientific community and were no longer controlled by the Party
                            and this was a good development.</p>

                                memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">Not printed.</note> which you
                            may wish to read in full reporting on his discussions with Spanish
                            military officials in Madrid, November 18-20, 1968. General Wheeler
                            reports that the Spanish took a hard line concerning the increased
                            threat from Soviet forces in the Mediterranean and the inadequacy of the
                            present defense agreements between Spain and the U.S. He estimates that
                            in order to continue the full use of the Spanish bases, the U.S. offer
                            will have to be approximately 100 million dollars more in grant aid than
                            what might have been agreed earlier (i.e. $200 million instead of our
                            offer of $100 million).</p>
                        <p>In conversations with the Spanish Vice President, Admiral Carrero Blanco,
                            and General Diez-Alegria, General Wheeler elicited the following
                            information:</p>
                        <p>1. Spain has no intention of pursuing a neutralist course.</p>
                        <p>2. Spain must have a military force capable of unilateral defense
                            actions, presumably in North Africa.</p>
                        <p>3. Considerable difficulty would be encountered in “stopping
                            the clock” on the time period left for negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0487"/>
                        <p>4. No decision has been made by the <gloss target="#t_GOS1">GOS</gloss>,
                            as yet, regarding the continued use of Torrejon Air Base.</p>
                        <p>5. Senior Spanish officials desire to continue a military relationship
                            with the U.S., but consider the present arrangement an inadequate
                            guarantee of Spanish security.</p>
                        <p>6. The Spaniards would leap at the chance to become a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, although they will not make any
                            overt effort to do so.</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler agreed with Spanish military officials to hold the next
                            meeting in Madrid on December 4, 1968, in order to identify in greater
                            detail those threats which could affect either country, and to jointly
                            study ways to meet such threats by determining appropriate tasks and
                            missions which each should undertake. General Burchinal will be General
                            Wheeler's representative for these discussions.</p>

                            present reassessment of the military value to the United States of base
                            rights in Spain, to provide a basis for United States re-examination of
                            our current position.</p>

                            talks in Madrid with General Navarro, Chief of Staff of the Spanish Air
                            Force. A copy of the agreed minute on the talks is at Tab A.<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>General Bane stressed the following points:</p>
                        <p>—The Spanish military is insisting on the creation of a joint
                            U.S.-Spanish Military planning body which would plan joint exercises,
                            joint utilization of the bases, and mutual defense.</p>
                        <p>—The Spanish want us to give them tactical nuclear weapons
                            training to the same extent that we provide such training for our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>—General Wheeler believes the negotiations are going to be
                            very tough, and thinks that it is going to cost us another $100 million
                            to get a renewal agreement. (Before the Spanish invoked Article V last
                            September, they were asking for $690 million for the 5-year renewal; our
                            top offer was $140 million.)</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler has designated General Burchinal as his representative
                            for the next round of military talks with the Spanish, to be held in
                            Madrid December 4. This meeting will be limited to an examination of and
                            preparation of a report on:</p>
                        <p>—The threats which could affect either country, jointly or
                            singly.</p>
                        <p>—The appropriate tasks and missions which the U.S. and Spain
                            should undertake, bilaterally or unilaterally, to meet these
                            threats.</p>

                        <p>In your October 17 meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> you agreed that as a matter
                            of national policy the two countries desired to continue the defense
                            relationship. The same view was expressed by General Franco in your
                            brief conversation with him in Madrid.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">According to the memorandum of conversation, Franco stated:
                                “It had always been his wish to continue relations and
                                that there existed a broad base of common interest for both
                                countries. He stressed, however, that the agreements were old and
                                had to be updated because of the change in the
                                situation.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                                SP-US)</note>

                        <p>You further agreed to a high level military meeting at the middle of
                            November to come up with common strategic concepts which would
                            constitute the framework for continued U.S.-Spanish cooperation; this to
                            be followed by a related program of military assistance.</p>
                        <p>As a final phase you envisaged political conversations between yourself
                            and Castiella to clear up any remaining bilateral military and political
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>Military discussions were initiated by General Wheeler, November 18-20
                            and continued by General Burchinal in Madrid, December 4-6. A follow-up
                            military meeting is scheduled to be held in Stuttgart, December 17-19,
                            with a final round of military talks in January, possibly in Madrid, on
                            a date to be agreed later.</p>
                        <p>In light of this timetable, it does not seem likely that you will be able
                            to conclude the base negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1">Castiella</persName> prior to January 20. In this connection you
                            might recall that we have firm indications of Spanish interest to carry
                            over the base talks to the incoming administration.</p>
                        <p>My inclination is not to press for rapid action but to let nature take
                            its course. If you agree, please indicate. If you disagree, we will need
                            to prod Defense to tighten up the schedule on military talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">

                            discussing this week's talks with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> leaders in Washington:</p>
                        <p>These talks can only be characterized as frank and far-ranging. We were
                            not disappointed in our expectation that there would be agreement on
                            most of the issues that face us. This did not inhibit either side from
                            forcible statements of positions involving disagreements.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will
                            continue to press at Geneva for meaningful yet prudent disarmament
                            measures. The British agreed with our intention to continue to seek
                            bilateral agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            where these are to our interest. On Berlin and Germany, we agreed to
                            continue to discuss proposals in the Ambassadorial Group in Washington
                            for possible approaches to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for
                            negotiations. Both sides remain unalterably committed to join with their
                            allies in looking for honorable settlements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Both were emphatically agreed that
                            they will follow up every opportunity to pursue peace.</p>
                        <p>Obviously the conversations were responsive to the immediate problems the
                            British face in Cyprus, Zanzibar and East Africa. The US gave full
                            support to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> efforts to stabilize these
                            areas. The British in turn expressed appreciation for this support and
                            specifically for the US work in the Cyprus problem on which we are
                            remaining closely and continually in touch.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">A February 13 memorandum of conversation regarding Cyprus is in

                        </p>
                        <p>Southeast Asia was the subject of serious discussion, particularly the
                            heavy responsibilities each country bears in Malaysia and South <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0491"/>Viet-Nam. We concluded that the
                            independence and freedom of both these countries are our vital
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The different philosophy of trade held by the two countries was clear in
                            discussing trade with Cuba. The Prime Minister made plain <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> determination neither to allow military
                            material to be exported to Cuba nor to allow official credits to be
                            extended to Castro for purchases of any material. But equally clear was
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> determination to continue
                            non-discriminatory treatment of all countries in trade in peaceful
                            commodities on regular commercial terms. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> did agree that Cuba represents a serious problem in
                            subversion in this Hemisphere, but he could not for historical
                            commercial policy reasons join us fully in our attempt to squeeze Cuba
                            economically in order to isolate Castro politically. The different
                            philosophies were reflected somewhat less starkly in the discussion of
                            long-term credits to the Soviet Union, although the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was again frank in his view that a
                            “fat Communist” was a relatively safe Communist.
                            We replied that it was not quite that simple and that controls on credit
                            would force the Communists, if they really wanted to become
                            “fat,” to divert resources from military
                            expenditures, a course obviously in all our interests.</p>
                        <p>We told the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that we were not to be
                            dissuaded from beginning the Kennedy Round talks on time, and the
                            British agreed this was the best course.<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">A

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>In our talks in Washington we agreed that we would reaffirm together the
                            understandings of our two Governments with regard to consultation in the
                            use of nuclear weapons. I now confirm this agreement in the attached
                            Memorandum of Understanding. It is very much like the one which
                            President Kennedy sent to Prime Minister Macmillan in February
                                1961,<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2"> Kennedy confirmed the

                        <p>I note also that our two Governments have a continuing commitment to
                            consult with the North Atlantic Council concerning the use of nuclear
                            weapons anywhere, if time permits.<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">In a

                                Memorandum of Understanding correctly represented the position of
                                the U.K. Government and noted the continuing validity of the
                                undertakings given by the two governments in 1962 to consult the
                                North Atlantic Council, if time permitted, on the use of nuclear

                        <p>1. Our understanding on the use of British bases is that the President
                            and Prime Minister will reach a joint decision by speaking personally
                            with each other before certain forces equipped with U.S. nuclear weapons
                            and operating from bases in the United Kingdom will <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0493"/>use nuclear weapons, namely <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, British Bomber Command,<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">Excluding aircraft of such Command equipped with

                            <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>-assigned forces in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and U. S. Polaris submarines in British
                            territorial waters. The basic understanding is contained in the
                            communiquéof January 9, 1952 covering the Truman-Churchill
                            talks:</p>
                        <p>“Under arrangements made for the common defense, the United
                            States has the use of certain bases in the United Kingdom. We reaffirm
                            the understanding that the use of these bases in an emergency would be a
                            matter for joint decision by His Majesty's Government and the
                            United States Government in the light of circumstances prevailing at the
                            time.”</p>
                        <p>Procedures for carrying out this basic understanding were agreed upon in
                            the Murphy-Dean Agreement of June 7, 1958, which was approved by the
                            President and the Prime Minister. The covering document, the Report to
                            the President and the Prime Minister, repeats almost literally the
                            language of the Truman-Churchill communiqué:</p>
                        <p>“2. The basic understanding between the United Kingdom and
                            United States Governments, regarding the use of bases in the United
                            Kingdom by United States forces, provides that such use in an emergency
                            shall be a matter for joint decision by the two Governments in the light
                            of the circumstances at the time.”</p>
                        <p>2. There is a second, more general understanding with the British that we
                            will consult with them before using nuclear weapons anywhere, if
                            possible. The basic understanding on this point is contained in a
                            memorandum of conversation of a meeting between the President and Eden
                            on March 9, 1953. Eden had asked for an assurance of consultation by the
                            President with the Prime Minister prior to U.S. use of any nuclear
                            weapon.</p>
                        <p>“He (the President) said that the United States would, of
                            course, in the event of increased tension or the threat of war, take
                            every possible step to consult with Britain and our other
                            allies.”</p>
                        <p>The President reaffirmed this understanding when he wrote to the Prime
                            Minister on October 27, 1960, in connection with the Holy Loch
                            berthing:</p>
                        <p>“With reference to the launching of missiles from U.S. Polaris
                            submarines, I give you the following assurance, which of course is not
                            intended to be used publicly. In the event of an emergency, such as
                            increased tension or the threat of war, the U.S. will take every
                            possible step to consult with Britain and other Allies. This reaffirms
                            the assurance I gave Foreign Secretary Eden on March 9,
                            1953.”</p>
                        <p>3. It should be noted that the agreement for joint decision by the
                            President and the Prime Minister does not extend to all U.S. forces
                            under <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0494"/>

                        <p>The President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> he
                            was glad to see him again and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> recalled that he had last been in the White House
                            in April 1963,<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">April 2, 1963. Documentation

                            to Washington since then at the time of the funeral ceremony for
                            President Kennedy.</p>
                        <p>The President said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            that things seemed to be going a little better in Cyprus, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> agreed though he
                            commented that it seemed that a vote at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the resolution had been postponed until
                                tomorrow.<note n="3" xml:id="d227fn3">Reference is to Security

                                Documents, 1964, pp. 566-567.</note> The President said he had
                            prepared a message to send to President Inonu of Turkey that very
                            morning, but had held <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0495"/>off from
                            doing so because it seemed that the Turks were coming on board. He
                            feared the postponement implied that there was some difficulty coming
                            from Makarios. The President commented that he had seen Makarios last
                                year,<note n="4" xml:id="d227fn4">September 1962; see<ref target="frus1961-63v16#d263">

                                    Document 263</ref>.</note> and had formed the impression that he
                            was a very hard man. (The President called Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> on the phone in order to
                            get the latest information on Cyprus.)</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> why
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> considered it worthwhile to
                            continue to trade with Cuba, which represented only about $5 million,
                            when by so doing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was creating so
                            much anti-British feeling over here. The President said that after the
                            Prime Minister's press conference in Washington on the
                            subject, there had been a great deal of criticism of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Had the Prime Minister merely pointed
                            out that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had reduced its trade
                            with Cuba from $55 million to $5 million, the effect would have been
                            favorable instead of unfavorable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said that the reason why the Prime Minister had
                            spoken in the way he did was in order to get votes at home by taking the
                            position of a staunch defender of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            policy and interests. The President set forth the reasons that lay
                            behind US policy toward Cuba and said that Castro's policy
                            was a great threat not only to this hemisphere but to Western security
                            as a whole. He said it was important that this fact should be
                            understood. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> replied
                            with classic British reasoning on not using foreign trade as an
                            instrument of coercion except in exceptional cases. He recalled that
                            when he was President of the Board of Trade he himself had instituted a
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> embargo on shipments of arms to
                            the Soviet Union, and that he had at one point cut off all trade with
                            Hungary when the Hungarian government had arrested a British business
                            man. However when it came down to non-strategic commodities, it was
                            British policy to encourage trade across the board. He pointed out that
                            buses could not be considered to be in this category. The President said
                            that the situation must be looked at in terms of Cuba's needs
                            to keep her economy going. He said that buses represented 80 per cent of
                            Cuban transportation. On the other hand, US wheat sales to the Soviet
                            Union were a one-shot deal and represented less than one per cent of the
                            Soviet Union's need in wheat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said he realized that
                            this was a difficult issue between the United States and the United
                            Kingdom and that he would do everything he could to keep it from playing
                            a major role in the campaign. He said he thought that the British
                            elections would take place in May or June, because the Tories would not
                            be able to hold out until the last moment. He said he thought there
                            would be a certain amount of anti-American sentiment aroused, in the
                            course of the campaign, by the Conservative party. There were still
                            memories of Suez, and there were back-benchers <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0496"/>in the Conservative party who would
                            play up to nationalistic feeling for electoral purposes. He stressed to
                            the President that the Labor party was a strong supporter of NATO and
                            the Atlantic community, and had a broad international outlook which was
                            not the case with the rank and file Conservatives. He said the Labor
                            party wanted to play a positive role in Europe but did not want
                            “to be corralled in a little Europe with the Six.”
                            The Labor party was mindful of the broad interests of the Commonwealth
                            and wanted to play a part which would be in active support of US efforts
                            to maintain worldwide security.</p>
                        <p>Turning to defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            repeated almost verbatim the arguments he had used in his talk with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d227fn5">A memorandum of their conversation is in the
                                National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964-66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</note> He
                            said that a Labor government would want to get rid of the national
                            deterrent which made no sense at all for England today. He said this
                            would save 300 million pounds which could be used to put back the
                            British fleet on the high seas, and would permit an increase in
                            conventional forces so that the UK could play an active and useful role
                            in putting out brush fires when necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> for
                            his views on the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> replied with the standard
                            arguments which he had already expressed at lunch.<note n="6" xml:id="d227fn6">No record of this conversation was found.</note> He
                            said that the only circumstances in which the Labor government would
                            support the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> would be if this were
                            the only way to prevent Germany from acquiring a national nuclear force.
                            He said that he did not think that the German government wanted this, or
                            that there was any support for this in German public opinion. The
                            President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> whether
                            he really thought that Germans had abandoned their desire to play a
                            dominant role, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said
                            that even if they wanted to do so, the West had the means of preventing
                            this from happening. He felt that the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> did have the result of putting the German finger on the
                            nuclear trigger. He was apprehensive of a possible development whereby
                            the United States would no longer retain the veto, and Germany might
                            find herself in a position of casting a majority vote by
                            “three to two.” The President said that such a
                            situation would never be permitted to arise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said that in general the
                            British elections would be waged and won on domestic issues, and he
                            himself wanted to wage a campaign against poverty, as President Johnson
                            himself was doing. The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> how he saw the relationship between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Labor party and the Democratic party in
                            the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said
                            he thought that both had much in common. They were both parties of the
                            people, with a strong social sense, and with a desire to develop and
                            change institutions in the interest of the welfare of the majority, <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0497"/>whereas the Conservative party
                            was inclined to preserve the vested interests of a minority and to
                            resist change and progress. The President mentioned the London municipal
                            elections coming up in early April and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> how he thought they would go. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said he was reasonably
                            optimistic.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned the A-11, the new US interceptor plane. He said
                            it had a speed of 3.2 Mach and a ceiling above 70,000 feet. He said this
                            was a very considerable technical advance which was of great importance
                            to the Free World. He said he had sent a message to the Prime Minister
                            informing him about the announcement before he had made it. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said that this plane
                            was a very great development and that it pointed up the fact that it was
                            useless for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to try to play a role
                            in the same league as the United States in the defense field. He said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> just wasn't
                            “in the same line of country,” and that this was
                            further justification of the Labor party's policy to get rid
                            of the national deterrent.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> thanked
                            the President for having received him, and his family, and said he hoped
                            very much to have the chance of seeing him and Mrs. Johnson again in
                            London and in Washington.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he was going to
                            surprise Foreign Secretary Butler by discussing an aspect of the Cuban
                            problem other than trade. He referred to over-flights of Cuba by U.S.
                            U-2 aircraft. The Secretary said the Soviets were pulling out of Cuba
                            and turning the surface-to-air missiles (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s) over to the Cubans. We had information that some
                            Soviet passenger ships were en route to Cuba and we believed that these
                            would be used to remove the remaining Soviet troops. We were glad to see
                            the Soviets leaving but were not happy about the Cubans taking over the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s. A couple of weeks ago, we had
                            sent the Cubans a low-key message on the subject but they had come
                            roaring back with some Soviet support. Our flights are unobtrusive. They
                            are seen only on radar. We feel that we must keep up some surveillance
                            so that we know what is going on down there. If the Cubans try to
                            prevent the over-flights we would have a nasty situation. Castro had
                            turned down the two proposals which would have dealt with the problem,
                            both of which had been approved by the Soviets. The first would have
                            provided for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> surveillance and the
                            second was for a nuclear-free zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> said that what would
                            worry the British would be retaliation. The Secretary said there would
                            be retaliation. We would take out a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            site if a U-2 were knocked down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> observed that the U.S.
                            would be acting even more resolutely than the British had at Harib.
                            Duncan Sandys said at the time of the Harib incident that the U.S. would
                            have to support the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> because the U.S.
                            would eventually want British support on Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> added that at his press
                            conference that morning, he had told the U.S. newsmen off the record
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like to support the
                            U.S. on Cuba. He presumed that our retaliation would lead the Cubans to
                            take their case to the Security Council and the U.S. would have to cast
                            its first veto.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not know if Cuba would go to the
                            Security Council. We might take the matter to the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> asked what was our
                            jurisdictional justification for over-flights. The Secretary replied
                            that they had been approved by the hemisphere.<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">For text of the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>

                                722-723.</note> The Cubans were bound not to interfere with the
                            over-flights. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> asked
                            what action might come out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The
                            Secretary said that U Thant might be asked to send some observers to
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> then asked if the U.S.
                            would consult the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> before retaliating.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we would
                            give the UK advance notification. The Secretary said that the time would
                            be very short.</p>
                        <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had repeatedly sent to the Cubans signals on
                            two points which bothered us. The first was a military connection with
                            Moscow and the second was subversion in the hemisphere. We had good
                            evidence that they were going on with their subversive efforts.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> recalled
                            the Cuban crisis in 1962. When it came, Prime Minister Macmillan had
                            called him and asked him to come to Number 10 Downing Street. Macmillan
                            had said he couldn't stand to be alone at such a time. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> had gone to 10 Downing
                            Street and had been privy to the numerous communications exchanged
                            between Macmillan and President Kennedy. He would say for the new Prime
                            Minister that he would like the President or Secretary Rusk to use the
                            communications which we have in the same manner as they had been used by
                            Macmillan and Kennedy. He said he thought this was as far as he could
                            take it. He added that the U.S. was playing with fire. Finally, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> said he would like to
                            make it absolutely clear that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was
                            sympathetic and understood the U.S. concern with Cuba.</p>

                        <p>As you know, there has been friction over the past few years between the
                            United States and other principal maritime nations about the regulation
                            of shipping in several of its aspects. This has now reached a point
                            where the application of United States legislation<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Reference is to the Bonner Act, amending the
                                Shipping Act of 1916. For text of P.L. 87-346, approved October 3,
                                1961, see 75 Stat. 762.</note> by the Federal Maritime Commission
                            would, in our view, invade our jurisdiction and produce a situation
                            which it would be politically impossible for any British Government to
                            accept. Other principal maritime nations are faced with the same
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I am disturbed about the possible effects of this situation on the
                            general state of the Western Alliance. As things are, we shall be faced
                            with recurrent crises, the first on July 3, the date now set for the
                            conclusion of dual rate contracts. In these circumstances I would ask
                            you <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0500"/>to give your most serious
                            consideration to the annexed Memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> in which I suggest both that an international
                            conference should be held to consider the basic question of jurisdiction
                            in these matters, and also that you should not take action against our
                            shipping while the question of principle is being discussed.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you will agree that we must find a way out of these
                            difficulties and my suggestions are designed to provide one. I hope you
                            will find them helpful.<note n="4" xml:id="d229fn4">In a June 25

                            Prime Minister, it might be appropriate to speculate about his possible
                            attitude toward Anglo-American negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I believe we will find him, at least for a considerable time to come,
                            desirous of personally controlling all important aspects of British
                            policy, foreign and domestic. The charge during the campaign that he was
                            a “one man band” was fully justified. In fact, the
                            contribution to victory made by other leaders of the party including
                            those likely to be Cabinet ministers, was relatively minor, except in
                            their own constituencies. Indeed, those who commanded a national
                            audience were often sources of acute embarrassment, since their
                            utterances sometimes required rectification by him.</p>
                        <p>As a politician, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> clearly
                            demonstrated his superiority in intellectual ability, adroitness, and
                            persuasiveness, over his associates. <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0501"/>The disparate elements in Labour ranks became cohesive
                            under his leadership, united by a desire to win. It is to be expected
                            that once the rewards are apportioned, there will be a resumption of
                            internal feuds, exposing the doctrinal factionalism that has long
                            plagued a party representing so many conflicting philosophies.</p>
                        <p>Intrigued by the manner in which the American President is served by a
                            personal staff, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> is
                            likely to make a small scale adaptation of it for his own use,
                            especially in the early days of office. Since Cabinet officials must sit
                            in Parliament, the decisions usually reached with their advice and
                            concurrence may be made more often than has been customary by the Prime
                            Minister alone, perhaps after consultation with a sort of
                            “kitchen Cabinet” of non-Parliamentarians.</p>
                        <p>He will have in the key positions of Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Minister of Defense,
                            appointees on whose judgment in affairs vital to their own departments
                            and to the national security, he will not completely rely. The same will
                            apply, in lesser degree, to heads of the great domestic areas of
                            government. Consequently, while the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            will preserve the appearance of operating under normal Cabinet
                            conditions (it being remembered that its members have traditionally been
                            accustomed to exercise more independent authority than do ours), he can
                            be expected himself to outline, and support in negotiations, those
                            essential policies requiring agreement between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>We must therefore prepare ourselves for a greater degree of high level
                            negotiation with the British than has been our previous experience.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>, and whoever becomes Foreign
                            Minister may eventually be replaced by stronger individuals, but for the
                            present their field of maneuver will be restricted.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> will, within a short time, wish to
                            have a date set for conversations with President Johnson, whose
                            re-election is taken for granted in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is tempting to try to analyze Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s character, but to do so would
                            require a magazine length report. No telegraphic summary could do
                            justice to his complicated, often inconsistent, personality; only his
                            future actions will disclose whether his numerous detractors or admirers
                            have properly assessed his intentions and capacities. I would, however,
                            recommend to those in our govt, who must shortly deal with him, an
                            article in the Sunday <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> of October 11, by
                            Peregrine Worsthorne entitled “A Man With Fire in His Belly,
                            But.”</p>
                        <p>I do not entirely subscribe to those views expressed by the author
                            summarized in the statement: “The Labour Govt, should it be
                            elected, will find itself opposing the United States on a major issue of
                            policy (<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>), outraging the West Germans
                            and delighting the Russians all in the first few weeks of
                            office.”</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0502"/>
                        <p>I consider that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> is too
                            clever by half to commit such an egregious blunder. While he is unlikely
                            to accommodate his foreign policies to those of the United States to the
                            same extent as have a succession of Conservative governments, if our
                            negotiations are skillfully managed from the beginning (but only so) I
                            believe we can, with patience, enter into transactions with him to our
                            mutual benefit. In the particular case of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>, though he and most of his party have no liking
                            whatever for it, if he thinks he can gain large national advantages by
                            participating in it, his reluctant assent to doing so will depend on a
                            comprehensive bargain with us.</p>
                        <p>There is no chance, in my opinion, of his signing the treaty until there
                            have been discussions between him and ourselves on the whole issue of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense, about which he
                            entertains strong convictions and prejudices. Nevertheless he is keenly
                            aware of the paramount necessity of reaching, after extensive
                            argumentation, an accord with us on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense and on the general terms of foreign policy,
                            excepting such questions as trade with Cuba, long term credits to the
                            Soviet Bloc, recognition of Communist China, and other matters which we
                            have been unable to settle to our satisfaction with preceding British
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>The greatest single danger, provided he is satisfied otherwise, to an
                            agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> on the
                            principle of British adhesion to the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>
                            (he will certainly under any conditions propose some alterations in the
                            current plans) will, in my estimation, spring from his over sanguine
                            views of what concessions might be obtained from the Soviet Govt in the
                            security field. I do not think that in his frequent trips to Russia he
                            has been hornswoggled, but he has certainly cajoled himself into
                            believing he can negotiate more successfully with the Soviet Govt than
                            any other allied statesman. Until he has had his beard singed, he may
                            attempt to persuade us to use the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> as
                            a bargaining counter with the Soviets, and to be prepared to abandon it
                            in return for a spectacular Soviet offer on disarmament.</p>
                        <p>A lesser danger is that in proposing to renounce Britain's
                            independent nuclear deterrent, he will cherish expectations of receiving
                            from us a greater quid pro quo than our own interests should permit. If,
                            by what he calls “renegotiation of the Nassau
                            Pact,” he could arrive at an understanding with the US that
                            he could represent to his own people as establishing a special
                            relationship with us on the control and use of nuclear military weapons,
                            only short of an equal right to a finger on the trigger, he might well
                            consider <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> accession a low price to
                            pay. I think it would be both unwise and unnecessary for us to consider
                            such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Britain's entry into the Common Market, or
                            participation in European integration in any form, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> and his party can be expected to
                            be far less likely to move in that direction than have been the
                            Conservatives. He has so forcefully and optimistically pledged himself
                                <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0503"/>to the development of trade
                            with the Commonwealth, and imposed such conditions on possible
                            membership in the Common Market, that it would seem probable he will
                            experiment with the Commonwealth idea for at least a year before
                            seriously considering an alternative.</p>
                        <p>We will find Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> a
                            resourceful, tough, realistic, opinionated bargainer, but solely our own
                            lack of equal resourcefulness and determination would enable him to
                            profit at the expense of our more powerful position.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps these observations are sufficient for the moment. What we should
                            expect from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> on British
                            Guiana, countries East of Suez, the Kennedy Round, balance of payments
                            and other fiscal questions,<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">In telegram 1805
                                from London, October 16, the Embassy commented further:
                                    “<persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> will be
                                confronted immediately with over-hanging problem of difficult
                                British balance of payments. In Embassy opinion, problems may assume
                                grave proportions, although much of it now seems suppressed, dealt
                                with by short term borrowing and hidden from public eye and
                                consciousness.” (Johnson Library, National Security File,
                                Country File, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Vol. 2)</note> and
                            additional topics of joint concern, cannot be usefully developed at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>His domestic programs will have tangential consequences for us. It
                            remains to be ascertained whether he is dedicated to developing class
                            warfare. The small size of his majority may impede swift action aimed at
                            eliminating important sectors of the free enterprise system. His
                            anticipated proposals for taxation are awaited with fear in the City.
                            From a national standpoint, if radical changes occur in fiscal
                            management, as advocated by some of his advisers, there will be a
                            further diminution of confidence, already impaired by a Labor victory,
                            amongst Britain's creditors. This may prove his most serious
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The important thing is for us to be alert, when the time comes, to
                            advocate our own policies, and to persuade him to conform his to them
                            where we have made a reasonable case. We will not find him impervious to
                            reason, but will discover he is sceptical of some of our cherished
                            political, economic and military beliefs. He will be a tough nut to
                            crack.</p>

                        <p>Sir Eric Roll gave the Under Secretary three copies of the statement
                            being made by the British Government on October 26 concerning the urgent
                            economic measures it is taking to deal with the balance of payments
                                problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">The statement announced a plan
                                to correct the U.K. balance-of-payments deficit. The
                                plan's principal measures comprised a 15 percent
                                surcharge on all manufactured or semi-manufactured imports and a
                                system of export rebates. Extracts of the significant portions of
                                the Government White Paper, “The Economic
                                Situation,” are printed in <hi rend="italic">Keesing's Contemporary Archives, 1963-1964</hi>, pp.
                                20939-20994.</note> Sir Eric said he wished to stress the speed with
                            which the new government has tackled the problem and the new approach
                            which it represents. He said the contrast was not only with respect to
                            the Conservative stop-go policies, but also with respect to
                            Labor's former policies. He said the leaders of the new
                            government had rejected a return to the Sir Stafford Cripps siege
                            economy measures of 1946-1947. Sir Eric expressed the view that this is
                            a very significant development and, if the course is maintained, it can
                            affect the whole range of government policy, and not alone on the
                            economic side.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. Johnson, Sir Eric said that he did not
                            expect that there would be a drawing from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> before the end of November or early December. In the
                            discussion which followed on the statement to be made by the Department
                            on October 27, concerning the British measures, Sir Eric offered a
                            number of minor suggestions but expressed himself as satisfied with the
                            positive and helpful character of the proposed statement. He undertook
                            to endeavor to obtain a public statement by a United Kingdom minister
                            regarding the Kennedy Round negotiations to be made shortly after the
                            British statement on the balance of payments measures.<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">Apparent reference to a November 3 speech by

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> told the
                            President that he was very glad to be in Washington and appreciated
                            being received by the President. He said that the policies of our two
                            countries were very close. After the President had made complimentary
                            references to the role of Lord Harlech as Ambassador, the Secretary of
                            State gave a general account of the current round of discussions which
                            he said had been very satisfactory. Thirty or more subjects had been
                            broached and we had found that our purpose was the same on nearly all
                            points. He said there had been a wide range of agreement. He discussed
                            the status of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> question and said
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> had raised
                            some ideas which the Secretary wanted us to think about very carefully.
                            He said that these ideas should be subjects of discussion with other
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was very glad to hear this and he made
                            complimentary remarks about the members of his Cabinet and about the
                            role of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that among the important matters which had
                            been discussed we had found ourselves in agreement on (1) Article
                                19,<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">Reference is to Article 19 of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.</note> and (2)
                            British Guiana. The President said with regard to Article 19 that we
                            were interested in finding any face-saving device to let the Soviet
                            government get off the hook. The Secretary then gave a run-down on the
                            US position on Article 19.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                            for his estimate of Soviet policy in the light of the recent changes.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said he
                            naturally did not know what had been going on but was inclined to think
                            that something sudden must have happened to precipitate the sudden
                            change in leadership.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">Reference to
                                replacement of Khrushchev as Soviet Prime Minister and Party
                                Secretary by a collective leadership of Brezhnev, Podgorny, and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</note> He
                            thought that perhaps Khrushchev may have <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0506"/>had in mind an initiative on Germany which may have
                            been unacceptable to the other Soviet leaders. He thought that there was
                            also possibly an element of criticism of Khrushchev's
                            handling of the Chinese problem. He also thought that the question of
                            the allocation of resources had played a role in Khrushchev's
                            political demise.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> thought that Soviet policy was likely to get
                            tougher. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said
                            it was hard to know. He had found it particularly interesting that the
                            satellites had stood up so frankly in expressing reservations about the
                            recent change.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> thought about Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that the Prime
                            Minister and he very much wanted to talk about this matter after the US
                            elections. At all events he could assure the President that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government would not say anything on the
                            subject which might be embarrassing to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether Prime Minister Wilson wanted to come to
                            Washington. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                            replied emphatically in the affirmative and said he thought the best
                            time might be during the Christmas recess of the British Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the British Government had found de
                            Gaulle's trip to Latin America<note n="4" xml:id="d232fn4">September 21-October 15.</note> interesting and stimulating. The
                            President said he rather felt that the trip had been a flop. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that at
                            any rate it had been a good demonstration of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s physical energy, but he agreed
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> hadn't
                            left much behind.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName>'s views on Italy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that he thought that
                            the present Italian government must be helped in any way we could. He
                            said it was the only possible political formula. He spoke highly of
                            Saragat. He added that he was sure that Nenni was now a dedicated
                            anti-Communist but his political authority had recently been reduced and
                            he was perhaps beginning to fail somewhat due to his age and to his bad
                            fall a couple of years ago.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the Labor Government's margin in
                            Parliament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> was
                            rather optimistic and said that things were not as bad as was generally
                            thought. He said that the government could count in a certain measure on
                            support from the Liberal Party. He said that one factor working for the
                            government was general distaste in England for another election.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> thought about Chancellor Erhard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said he thought that
                            Erhard was a weak man who wanted to be loved by everybody, and that this
                            was not a good state of mind for a politician to be in. The President
                            said that he liked the contrast between Erhard and Adenauer. He felt
                            that Erhard had some flexibility whereas Adenauer “thought
                            that the Communists <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0507"/>were going
                            to eat him before breakfast every morning.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> agreed and said that
                            Erhard's electoral prospects were not as good as they might
                            be since the Socialists had shown increasing strength in recent local
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to Cuba and said he hoped the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government was not going to announce a new deal between
                            now and next Tuesday. He recalled the experience he had had with Sir
                            Alec <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Douglas-Home</persName> in January
                            [February] on the same subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d232fn5">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> The Secretary of State
                            mentioned the possibility of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            developing its trade with other Latin American countries and thus being
                            in a position to justify giving up trade with Cuba on purely commercial
                            grounds rather than by announcing a change in policy.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> domestic financial
                            situation, the President asked whether the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was going to cut down on its imports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> thanked the President for
                            the US reaction to and support of the measures which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had just announced. The President
                            commented that these measures had been understood here as being
                            necessary and that we had been glad to support them. He said he hoped
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would find it possible to
                            give a quid pro quo by helping us on Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that he felt that
                            one must take into account the fact that if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had not sold buses to Cuba then the French would have
                            done so but he hoped that we would make an effort to bring the French
                            into line on trade with Cuba too. He reiterated his thanks for the way
                            the Administration had reacted to the current <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> financial difficulties. The Secretary said that we would
                            be glad to sell the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> more beef and the
                            President commented that he was delighted to get this support for his
                            difficulties from the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Returning again to the subject of a visit to Europe, the President said
                            that he would be glad to see the Prime Minister here in early December
                            if this was mutually convenient. He thought that he himself would be
                            heavily involved in the first few weeks of the New Year with budget and
                            other matters such as the economic and State-of-the-Union messages to
                            the Congress so he would have to see later how things looked for a
                            possible visit some time in the spring.</p>
                        <p>The President said in general that the US Government wanted to be as
                            helpful as possible to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He said
                            that there was some uncertainty in the air with new governments and
                            changes occurring in many places. He remarked that he was counting on
                            absentee votes from Americans in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            to help him out in next week's elections. He observed that
                            there had been some pretty active and successful organization of
                            Americans in England.</p>

                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> what he thought about the Chinese Communist
                            explosion of a nuclear device. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> said he was glad that it had been announced ahead
                            of time by the US government.<note n="6" xml:id="d232fn6">For text of

                            President commented that this was due to the wisdom of the Secretary of
                            State, who in turn said that it had been the President's
                            decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said
                            that naturally the explosion itself had come as no surprise but it was
                            still a disturbing development. What had surprised them was the fact
                            that the Chinese had used U-235 instead of plutonium.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he thought our intelligence cooperation was
                            excellent and that he was glad that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> was going over to London soon to see the Prime
                            Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said
                            he would be very glad to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and valued our close relationship in this field.
                            The Secretary commenced that our cooperation was so intimate that we
                            occasionally knew everything about each other's diplomatic
                            activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName>
                            said that he greatly valued our close relationship in this field and
                            wanted it to continue.</p>

                        <p>I feel that I ought to let you know that we are facing a serious
                            situation on sterling.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> discussed the run on
                                the pound in The Labour Government, 1964-1970, pp. 31-38.</note> The
                            pound has been under strong pressure for several days, and although the
                            last two days were better, we cannot be sure that this improvement will
                            continue. The pressure is coming from a number of sources, including the
                            Continent, and probably for a variety of motives.</p>
                        <p>We intend, as you know, to draw at the beginning of next month enough of
                            our I.M.F. standby to repay the short term credit we have received from
                            the Federal Reserve and the other central Banks. We <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0509"/>might perhaps then expect to have a
                            little over $300 million left in our standby. We shall also have
                            reconstituted the swap facility with the Federal Reserve; the other
                            central Banks also may be willing to give further short term assistance,
                            though this cannot be certain in present circumstances. But, if the run
                            on sterling continues at anything like Monday's rate, we
                            shall have exhausted the credit facilities at present available to us in
                            a matter of weeks. We are being advised that, if we raised the Bank rate
                            this week, we should probably halt the drain. But we are very reluctant
                            to do this since it would run counter to the long-term policies we are
                            developing for dealing with our basic economic problems; and I have no
                            doubt that these are on the right lines and will be successful if only
                            they are given time to work.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I believe that an increase in our Bank rate would be as
                            unwelcome to you as it would be to us. Am I right in thinking this? Of
                            course, if you are intending shortly to raise your own discount rate for
                            your own reasons we shall reluctantly have to follow you; and I would
                            hope that we could then make this a concerted operation. But if, as I
                            believe, this is not in your mind, we for our part will do our best to
                            withstand the pressure.</p>
                        <p>In any event, however, recent experience has shown that, if we are to
                            outmanoeuvre the speculators in the short term and to give our longer
                            term policies the chance to mature, we need substantial reinforcement
                            for sterling as rapidly as possible. We therefore have it in mind to
                            approach the I.M.F. for a further standby of $1,000 million; and we
                            shall greatly value your support. In order to take the necessary
                            soundings Sir Eric Roll is returning to Washington today. He will be
                            able to give you, if you wish, a fuller explanation of our thinking; and
                            I shall be most grateful if you can let me have your reactions as soon
                            as possible.</p>

                            based on your views of what is necessary for the defense of

                            <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wanted first of all to go a little into
                            the general defense problem and then focus on the specific problem of
                            Atlantic nuclear defense arrangements. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> to lead off.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said that at the
                            Chequers meeting on the weekend of November 21 and 22,<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Reference is to a meeting of Ministers, advisers,
                                and service chiefs at the Prime Minister's weekend
                                retreat. The meeting is discussed in Wilson, The Labour Government,
                                1964-1970, pp. 35-37 and Zuckerman, <hi rend="italic">Monkeys, Men,
                                    and Donkeys</hi>, pp. 374-377.</note> the discussion had
                            concentrated on the future defense policy of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> over the next ten years, under the shadow of economic
                            pressure. It had been taken for granted that costs would continue to
                            rise. At the same time it was very hard to keep the defense effort down.
                            The only practical way to reduce expenditure would be to cut down the
                            number of people. This was not easy to do nor was it really possible to
                            achieve the necessary economies by reducing bodies. The only other way
                            was to economize in equipment. This raised the question of what role the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> expected to fill. What was to be
                            its mission? The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was the only European
                            power contributing both to European defense, and to the defense of
                            freedom outside of Europe. A great majority of the British people was in
                            favor of maintaining the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s
                            extra-European role, which included its obligations to the Commonwealth,
                            to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, and to the bases in third areas. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was in fact almost alone from Suez to
                            Singapore. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> felt very strongly that
                            the danger of a major war in Europe was now very small. On the other <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0512"/>hand, the danger of war outside
                            of Europe was already great and growing greater. Had it not been for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s prompt action in
                            throwing “nugatory forces” into East Africa
                            earlier this year, the West might have had another Congo on its hands.
                            The breakdown of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense expenditures
                            in percentages of allocation was roughly as follows: 10 per cent for a
                            strategic nuclear role, 30 per cent for the defense of Europe, 30 per
                            cent “overseas”, 30 per cent home defense. Healey
                            went on to say that he would like the reaction of the US Government to
                            the priorities of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense effort.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like the US to consent to a
                            nuclear role for 88 V-bombers and some Polaris submarines which would
                            make a major contribution to a solution of the problem of nuclear
                            defense arrangements of the Allies. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was prepared to put its entire strategic reserve in the
                            Alliance. It would agree to a German veto within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It could not put all its V-bombers
                            inside Europe because it was important that some be reserved for a
                            non-nuclear role outside of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was also concerned by the question
                            of weapons: the weakness in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s present defense planning was that it was not
                            able to produce scenarios based on the needs of war outside of Europe,
                            e.g.: such varying needs as those for police actions in East Africa,
                            compared with a nuclear exchange with Communist China. Healey went on to
                            say that it would be highly desirable that the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (1) compare and clarify their respective
                            roles in these areas of the world; (2) increase and extend their
                            cooperation in logistical support in each other's efforts;
                            (3) cooperate in the field of nuclear weapons in relationship to
                            responsibilities and possible contingencies. With regard to its
                            world-wide responsibilities, excluding Europe, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could cover 95 per cent of contingencies
                            likely to arise. However, in order to cover the last 5 per cent, an
                            additional effort of something like one billion pounds sterling would be
                            necessary. Even with regard to operational requirements the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should have the best weapons available,
                            and this meant the desirability of buying certain US weapons rather than
                            some being produced at home. Quite apart from the economic benefits
                            involved, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> needed to maintain its
                            R&amp;D. This would have to be discussed with the US if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to “go
                            American” for certain weapons. There had been a
                            “great congruence” of attitudes at the Chequers
                            meeting. The problem was to translate attitudes into policies, and
                            policies into hard programs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that already
                            ten years ago there was a problem of the size and kind of bases which
                            could be maintained. He felt that if the problem of Malaysia could be
                                settled,<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">Following the 1963 action
                                granting independence to the Malaysia Federation, the Government of
                                Indonesia claimed portions of the new state's territories
                                and launched a limited war, which it labeled a
                                “confrontation,” to back its claims. The
                                United Kingdom provided military aid to Malaysia.</note> the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could look <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0513"/>forward to some solution for Aden. He said that in
                            terms of cost effectiveness, much the best thing would be if the UK
                            maintained Aden and Singapore.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon
                                Walker</persName> and Healey for their account of the general
                            defense problem facing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He urged
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to give full weight to the role
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a world power. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had not reduced her world role, in spite
                            of suggestions to this effect in the press. We were mindful that there
                            were 26 nations in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which were
                            “children” of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Then there was the Commonwealth. The US wanted the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to play as large a role as
                            possible. It could do certain things which the US, because of certain
                            fancies, could not itself do so well. We would look with the greatest
                            concern at a diminution of the UK's role, which was of very
                            great importance to us. What the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did
                            had a considerable bearing on what we ourselves were able to do. The US
                            had been carrying a very heavy budgetary burden over many years. In 1947
                            our defense budget was $10 billion. Since then we had spent over $600
                            billion in war expenditures. Since World War II the US had suffered
                            160,000 casualties at the hands of the Communists. (<persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> repeated this figure in a
                            tone of surprise.) We had provided over $100 billion in aid. We could
                            not be the gendarmes of the universe. At heart, the American people are
                            isolationists. Because of all this, what others are doing has a great
                            effect on what we ourselves are able to do. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> role has a multiplying effect on our own role. This
                            emphasizes the importance to the US of what the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> itself does. The French had cut back in Southeast Asia
                            and also in Africa. West Germany and Japan had not been able, for
                            various reasons, to shoulder their proportionate share of the common
                            defense burden. The interests of the free world required the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should play a role not only in terms of
                            its own interests but in terms of the interests of the free world as a
                            whole. We would agree that there was no prospect of a major war on the
                            horizon at this time. However, we should be careful about the
                            conclusions we draw from this. If this is indeed true it is due to the
                            fact that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is strong. Any change in
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force structure would have to
                            be very carefully considered in terms of its implication for the
                            defensive strength of the West and of the conclusions which the Soviets
                            might draw from it. The Secretary said that he was not enthusiastic
                            about trying to resolve the question on the basis of long discussions
                            and analyses of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy. The
                            problem was to decide what was prudently required on both sides. He had
                            the impression that the Soviets were now interested in the possibilities
                            of a formulation for the thinning out of troops. He wished to emphasize
                            that this was a very ticklish matter which required frank and extensive
                            discussion between allies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            said that he understood <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s
                            objectives to be: (1) to accord priority to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s extra-European forces; <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0514"/>(2) to reduce the level of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces over a period of ten years, and to
                            hold the military budget at the current absolute level. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said that the time-frame
                            envisaged was ten years, and that the effect would be to reduce the
                            percentage of the military budget in relation to the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> from 7-1/2 per cent to 5 per cent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that these
                            objectives were completely contradictory if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to try to achieve them by reducing men. Today, the
                            US had twice as many men in uniform per thousand of population as our
                            Allies. The people of the US were not prepared to accept this situation
                            in the long run. He said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> must
                            retain its manpower at the present level, if not increase it. A
                            corollary of this was that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would
                            not need to reduce its forces in Europe. (At this point Healey demurred
                            and said something about the situation inevitably requiring some
                            adjustment in Europe.) The Secretary of Defense said that except for the
                            foreign exchange impact there was no need for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to reduce its forces in Europe. The only way to
                            reconcile forces with the objectives was to make hard decisions
                            regarding equipment. It was necessary to destroy the myth that an arms
                            industry is necessary for economic expansion. He said that research and
                            development in the US absorbed only about 5 per cent of the defense
                            budget. We could help by working on working out a cooperative
                            R&amp;D development program with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He said that, speaking frankly, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was financing certain projects which made
                            no sense militarily and really represented a waste of money, in
                            particular the TSR-2,<note n="4" xml:id="d236fn4">A British-designed
                                prototype fighter aircraft.</note> as well as certain other
                            projects. He thought both the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the
                            US could benefit through greater integration, but he realized that this
                            was a very painful process in terms of domestic problems for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that the
                            weapons and equipment needed for a military mission in Europe were
                            different from those required for areas outside of Europe. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed, and said that what
                            the US needed from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was a firm
                            policy of acting as a world power. On this basis, the US could help with
                            the problem of the 5 per cent which Healey had alluded to. The Secretary
                            wondered whether anything could be done to increase the contribution and
                            participation of the Commonwealth, which had great reserves of power and
                            other assets to contribute. Healey said the trouble had been that
                            hitherto any extra-European role had looked as though it were
                            “the dying legacy of an imperial power.” When the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had intervened in other parts of
                            the world it had simply looked colonial. Also, people were inclined to
                            ask why the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should play a world role
                            if the empire were no longer there to justify it. He said that if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> once took a clear decision to play
                            a world role, this would be not to protect British interests, but to <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0515"/>contribute to peace and
                            stability in the world. He said Australia had made some effort of late
                            to help. Gordon Walker said he thought the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could convince Australia to increase its contribution to
                            the common effort. For example, Darwin would be useful as a triple base.
                            India was a problem, but if we assume increasing Chinese pressure and a
                            settlement of the Kashmir problem, he thought the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could probably develop an Indian contribution over the
                            next 10 to 15 years. Healey said the anti-colonial trauma was dying. He
                            felt that a real military capacity without any colonial aims contributed
                            to the creation of stability in the world. Gordon Walker said there was
                            an economic problem involved, and he felt that the UK needed some
                            thinning out of its forces. Healey commented that for all they knew,
                            they might have to send another battalion to British Guiana in the next
                            few days. He said a more formal agreement was needed in NATO, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should be entitled to withdraw
                            troops from Europe for special purposes at short notice. <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon Walker</persName> said that whatever the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did in Europe should help the
                            strengthening of the defense of Europe and that manpower was a vital
                            factor in this.</p>
                        <p>Turning to nuclear matters, Healey said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> recognized the growing anxiety on the part of
                            non-nuclear powers with regard to a guarantee by the nuclear powers.
                            There was also evidence of a sense of a need on the part of non-nuclear
                            powers to play a greater role, and there was growing interest in the
                            whole nuclear problem and its organization. Theoretically, there were
                            only two ways of meeting this: (1) to give non-nuclear powers nuclear
                            weapons; (2) to give them more influence over, and greater participation
                            in, the operation of nuclear weapons within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The first was, of course, unacceptable, and as for
                            the second, unless the nuclear powers retained their veto over the use
                            of nuclear weapons this would constitute dissemination. He said that
                            this stark truth could be fudged in negotiations but not in practice.
                            The talk about a “European clause” had
                            understandably given some Germans the idea that eventually the US might
                            be prevailed upon to give up its veto. The central problem was that
                            whatever the organization of a new nuclear force might be, either the
                            nuclear powers must retain their veto or they would be engaged in
                            dissemination.</p>

                        <p>The discussion then broke up shortly before five o'clock in

                        <p rend="center">PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_WH1">WILSON</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those present, in addition to the principals, were Sir Eric Roll, Sir
                            William Armstrong, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Chairman Martin, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_AHG1">Ackley</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> (most of the meeting), Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> (part of the
                            meeting).</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to begin with that this was a meeting which never
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>The President opened the discussion by referring to the close economic
                            relationships between the two countries, and the need for a full and
                            frank exchange of views on recent financial happenings and their impacts
                            in both countries. He referred to the effects on the U.S. economy not
                            only of the necessary rise in the discount rate, but also in terms of
                            public attitude toward future fiscal decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister began by summarizing recent events in the United
                            Kingdom, and the policies that had been adopted. He referred to the
                            critical economic situation which had been inherited from a Conservative
                            government that both failed to take necessary actions and concealed
                            facts about the seriousness of the situation. The Prime Minister
                            indicated his view that tighter money is no long-term solution to
                            British economic problems, and that the import surcharges were basically
                            wrong, although necessary in the short run. The basic solution has to
                            lie in improving Britain's competitive position both with
                            respect to exports and to manufactured imports. This will depend on many
                            things, but principally on improving the efficiency of British industry
                            and, in particular, on modernizing British capital equipment. He
                            referred to the plans to cut back on prestige projects, as well as on
                            some types of defense expenditures. He indicated his wish to discuss
                            with U.S. officials the possibilities of greater interdependence in both
                            research and production of weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated his appreciation of the importance of a
                            rigorous incomes policy, and reported that a
                            “treaty” on income developments, including
                            representatives of management, labor and government, would be signed and
                            announced around December 16.</p>
                        <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0517"/>
                        <p>He emphasized several times his view that deflation of the British
                            economy will provide no real solution to Britain's problems,
                            pointing out that restrictive practices on the part of labor and
                            management are encouraged and reinforced in an underemployed and slack
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>He discussed at some length the unfortunate developments which led to a
                            loss of confidence in the new British government. He indicated
                            particularly the unfortunate effects of having to explain and defend
                            British policies before a whole series of international meetings, each
                            generating leaks which agitated those in other countries who were
                            already antagonistic toward a Labor government.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his strong gratitude for the various public
                            statements which have been made at critical times by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Under Secretary Roosa, and
                            for the understanding attitude of Under Secretary Ball at the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> meetings. He was full of praise and
                            admiration for the American efforts to put together the $3-billion
                            currency package which finally put an end to speculation.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">For text of the November 28 announcement regarding
                                the package, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                        </p>
                        <p>He ended by stressing the importance of continuing consultation between
                            the two governments at all levels, and by committing himself and his
                            government with complete firmness against any possibility of a
                            devaluation in the pound.</p>
                        <p>The President then requested Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to comment on the British situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> summarized the
                            general view of his Government that the basic programs which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government had adopted were essentially
                            sound and correct. But he indicated that the difficulties which the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government had encountered could
                            be in part traced to unfortunate statements which British officials had
                            themselves made which played down the effectiveness on the domestic
                            economy of the measures they were taking. He reviewed several such
                            incidents in detail, and expressed the hope that in the future,
                            statements about the British situation and policy measures would be
                            limited, and would be designed to inspire the confidence of foreign
                            businessmen and governments.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then asked the view of the Americans about the best
                            timing for the announcement of further details of their more basic
                            programs to improve efficiency and competitiveness in British industry
                            and efforts. He wondered whether the situation was so critical that the
                            announcement should be made at the earliest possible date, or whether it
                            could be delayed until the details of programs had been more fully
                            developed.</p>
                        <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>The President asked Chairman Martin to comment on this question.</p>
                        <p>Chairman Martin indicated that in his view the situation remained highly
                            critical, and urged the earliest possible announcement of fundamental
                            measures which would strengthen confidence. He urged the British
                            government to attempt to ascertain from the Group of Ten what specific
                            measures would—in their view—be necessary in order
                            to restore the confidence of foreign governments and foreign businesses
                            in the integrity of the pound.</p>
                        <p>Both the Prime Minister and Sir Eric Roll objected that the several
                            governments and business communities represented in the Group of Ten had
                            divergent views about what policies would be necessary, and that it
                            would be impossible to please all of them, if, indeed, they could please
                            any of them.</p>
                        <p>The President encouraged Chairman Martin to indicate further his views of
                            the British actions. Chairman Martin believed that the most serious
                            element contributing to the British crisis had been the unfortunate
                            statements made, or reported to have been made, by members of the
                            British government. He discussed several of these statements in some
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>In continuing to indicate his views of the seriousness of the present
                            situation, Chairman Martin turned to the U.S. balance of payments,
                            indicating the importance, in his opinion, of additional U.S. measures
                            to strengthen our balance-of-payments position. In this connection he
                            referred to additional cutbacks of U.S. expenditures abroad which, he
                            said, had been agreed upon in September 1963 but never carried out. The
                            President indicated considerable interest in this subject and asked
                            Secretary Dillon for details.</p>
                        <p>The President then requested Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to enter the meeting and asked him about the
                            alleged failure to carry out reductions of military spending abroad
                            which had been agreed upon. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that a proposed program of
                            additional reductions, which had been presented to President Kennedy in
                            the fall of 1963, had not received his approval, because the Secretary
                            of State—rightly, in his opinion—had concluded
                            that they would not be feasible for political reasons.</p>
                        <p>The President then requested that his American advisers get together to
                            consider whether further measures could be taken to strengthen the U.S.
                            balance of payments, and asked that they be prepared to meet with him on
                            Friday (December 11) for a review of these measures. When Chairman
                            Martin indicated that he would be out of the city on Friday, the date
                            was changed to Thursday, December 10. (A paper was prepared by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> for such a meeting,
                            and was <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0519"/>sent to the President
                            on the night of December 8, but a meeting with the President could not
                            be arranged.)<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with an exchange between the President and the Prime
                            Minister in which each indicated his desire to maintain the closest
                            possible continuing consultation on economic matters, and both expressed
                            the view that this meeting had been very useful.</p>

                        <p>[Here follow 5 paragraphs on unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <p>Went to see Bill Martin at the Federal Reserve Board. I explained to him
                            my fears about another run on the pound if the British Government
                            perseveres in its present budgetary plans. The budget will be presented
                            in early April, and may engender, especially on the Continent, a further
                            lack of confidence in Labour's fiscal policies; this would,
                            in turn, affect the action to be taken on the British submission, in
                            late April, of another application for withdrawals from the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the current prosperity, so widely diffused in Great Britain,
                            their foreign payments problems have never been more dangerous. Whether
                            they are manageable, without a large cutback in prestige expenditures
                            abroad, and a reduced standard of living at home, remains to be seen.
                            The drastic measures probably required would, if enacted, be likely to
                            cause the downfall of any government that courageously sponsored
                            them.</p>
                        <p>One of the important factors in the long process, commencing during the
                            First World War, of deterioration in British revenues from abroad has
                            been the loss of former dependencies. Many of these newly independent
                            states are bountifully supplied with larger subsidies than they received
                            during their former status; in addition, their contributions to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reserves and resources have greatly
                            diminished. The most <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0520"/>prosperous
                            and dependable members of the Commonwealth, Canada and Australia, are
                            more interested in world markets, and in their own development, than in
                            the trade and other difficulties of the Mother Country.</p>
                        <p>Bill Martin told me of the rough going Cromer had last weekend at Basle
                            in obtaining an extension of the short term credits. At least the
                            British have another breathing spell during which they can again
                            scrutinize their financial position.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your letter about the simple option for buying the F111
                            which I received on 11th February.<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">Not
                                found.</note> I am very grateful to you for it and for all the help
                            you and your staff gave us in the discussions about buying the C130E and
                            the F4.</p>
                        <p>2. I should now like to take up your offer to have further discussions
                            about the F111 and I and my colleagues have still to decide whether to
                            buy this aircraft or to go ahead with the TSR2.</p>
                        <p>3. You will, of course, realise that this decision is going to be one of
                            the utmost difficulty for us and I do not need to tell you of the very
                            strong arguments for going ahead with the TSR2 which is doing well in
                            its development flying.</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0521"/>
                        <p>4. The really critical factor so far as the F111 is concerned is the need
                            to have the best and fullest information about it and to know exactly
                            how firm is this information. It would not serve collaboration well if
                            we were to abandon the TSR2 only to find that the F111 fell short of
                            expectations.</p>
                        <p>5. In particular we need to have:—</p>
                        <p>A. The firmest possible information on all cost factors for the F111 in
                            its presently planned configuration including, of course, the selling
                            price to us. We should like all this information broken down to the
                            maximum extent practicable;</p>
                        <p>B. Details of the progress of the F111 development programme to date;
                            your present technical evaluation of it against the planned programme;
                            your present in-service dates and the risk attaching to them;</p>
                        <p>C. The latest and best possible information on your plans for up-dating
                            the F111 avionics not only as regards what the technical plans for it
                            are and the date of introduction, but also on costs and the improvement
                            in capability it is likely to give and at which you are aiming;</p>
                        <p>D. The extent of your commitment in policy and funding to F111 MK.2
                            programme and at what stage you expect to decide whether to commit
                            yourselves irrevocably to it.</p>
                        <p>7. To discuss these and other points I would like to send over to you a
                            four man team from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation,
                            under Air Marshal Sir Christopher Hartley, which would be ready to start
                            business in Washington on 8th March.<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">No
                                record of this visit was found.</note> Apart from talks in
                            Washington I very much hope they could pay a brief visit to the
                            manufacturer and see the F111. I do not anticipate they would need to
                            stay in the United States more than four days. Before they came it would
                            also be very helpful if another small team could come over for a few
                            days starting on 2nd March to have detailed technical discussions about
                            present thinking on the avionics fit and in particular it would be very
                            helpful if these people could talk to your officers in systems command
                            who, I understand, are now working on it.</p>
                        <p>8. You will realize that these missions would be essentially factfinding,
                            but it is of the greatest importance to us that we should assemble all
                            the best facts and estimates that you can make available.</p>
                        <p>9. I hope you can agree to what I have suggested and that the dates
                            proposed will be convenient.</p>

                        <p>Following a private conversation with the Foreign Secretary, the
                            President called in the other participants. He said that the Foreign
                            Secretary had expressed to him the views of the British Government on
                            the situation in Vietnam which he then summarized. He went on to explain
                            what the U.S. was doing in Vietnam. The President said we had several
                            alternatives. We could simply stand and take it like animals do in a
                            storm. We could leave Vietnam. He did not think that the British and our
                            other allies wanted this. The President did not think that the British,
                            if they were in our place, would pull out. If we did pull out, where
                            would the retreat stop? We had learned from the dealings of Prime
                            Minister Chamberlain with Hitler that appeasement did not pay.</p>
                        <p>Another alternative which was being urged upon him, the President said,
                            was to carry the war to Hanoi and Peking. He had resisted these
                            pressures and had instead chosen a very carefully measured policy of
                            striking at the enemy. This policy was perhaps better understood and
                            supported by our soldiers in Vietnam than it was here in the U.S. He
                            read from a letter received from a soldier in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary asked if the U.S. realized what the consequences of
                            these policies might be. There were no signs that our tactics would
                            bring the communists to negotiate. Even if they did, how <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0523"/>could we get an agreement providing any
                            real guarantees for South Vietnam. And even if such an agreement were
                            possible, could we be sure that the South Vietnamese Government would be
                            able to control the situation within its own boundaries. The Foreign
                            Secretary referred to the need for the British Government to go a bit
                            further in suggesting negotiations than the U.S. would like. He referred
                            to pressures from the Labor Party backbenchers and from others in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that we could not be sure of course that our policy
                            would produce the desired results. Nothing was certain. He again
                            referred to the alternatives. The President said he would welcome any
                            practical suggestions for other policies. He said he did not think, on
                            the other hand, that it did any of us any good to air our differences in
                            the press. This helped our enemies.</p>
                        <p>There was a discussion on the use of tear gas in Vietnam and the strong
                            reaction this had produced in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The
                            President pointed out that tear gas was widely used for crowd control
                            purposes by law enforcement agencies in this country. It was considered
                            preferable to more forceful measures.</p>

                        <p>4857. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.
                            Pass to White House. I would like to emphasize how essential I think it
                            is that the US exercise more than usual caution and restraint in
                            whatever official statement or comment we make initially about the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> budget.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that in view of the attention which this budget is
                            attracting, and the importance it is expected to have on the future of
                            sterling, the US will be pressed to provide its official views at the
                            earliest possible moment. I also recognize that in view of the present
                            uncertainties in the exchange markets, we will want to state our opinion
                            with promptness, and in a manner that will be as helpful as is possible
                            under the circumstances toward removing the doubts about sterling.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, I think we should take care to avoid responding too quickly
                            and too enthusiastically to the British proposals. Such a response <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0524"/>might not appear genuine to the
                            rest of the world, and we might engender suspicions that the US and
                            Britain had jointly planned the budget and our response, which would be
                            most unfortunate. Particularly, with the experience of last autumn
                            surcharges, many of the Europeans and others are only too ready to
                            suspect the Anglo-American Special Relationship in matters such as this;
                            consequently in our endeavors to be helpful we might induce a contrary
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, a precipitous comment could have a harmful and unfair effect on
                            the govt here. From what I have heard of the procedures followed in the
                            past by Chancellors of the Exchequer in presenting a budget, the mere
                            allegation that a Chancellor had indicated in advance to other than his
                            Cabinet colleagues details recalls fate of Hugh Dalton, whose offhand
                            remark to a friendly journalist on an inconsequential feature of the
                            message he was to deliver in a few minutes, led to his subsequent
                            resignation and political degradation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the unusual circumstances, and frankness, with which Callaghan
                            has dealt with our officials in the past few days, I urge upon you the
                            need of not arousing speculation on linking US approval of the budget
                            with any hint of prior knowledge of any of its provisions.<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">No U.S. statement was issued.</note>

                        <p>The Prime Minister said the best part of the summer would be consumed by
                            a review of British defense commitments. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cannot count, for example, on an indefinite retention of
                            the Aden base though it is a vital staging point for Singapore. Much
                            consideration must also be given by the British to the purchasing of
                            weapons abroad, including the U.S. aircraft option.</p>
                        <p>The British were also concerned over the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> support cost; the Germans had behaved badly and there
                            was pressure in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to pull out
                            entirely. The foreign exchange problem figured importantly. The British
                            would have meetings with the Germans again in June; they had not wanted
                            to bring up the subject during the Queen's visit to Germany.
                            The Prime Minister speculated that they might have an explosion over
                            this issue. The Prime Minister said that <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> cost the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> about 90
                            million pounds per year. The Germans had offered to take a share in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> computer business but their
                            proposals had been rejected.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Russia seemed interested in thinning out
                            forces on both sides in Germany. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> remarked that he had told Dobrynin that we might be
                            interested in a significant reduction in combat troops. The Prime
                            Minister said he would rather take half of the British troops out of
                            Germany than withdraw them from the Far East; most of his colleagues
                            support him in this course.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he would like to see some four-power arrangement
                            for East of Suez affairs outside of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, etc. Such an arrangement could coordinate, for
                            example, air striking power.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary made three points:</p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should work together to

                            this direction. The Commonwealth countries could also help in

                        <p>2. The U.S. did not want to be the only country ready to intervene in any
                            trouble spot in the world. We hoped the British would continue to uphold
                            their world-wide responsibilities.</p>

                            should have common concern over “wars of

                        <p>The Chancellor's schedule now contemplates meetings with Under
                            Secretary Ball (Secretary McNamara or his representative joining for
                            part of the discussion) and with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AHG1">Ackley</persName>, in addition to the Treasury. The Chancellor will
                            also call at the International Bank, International Monetary Fund, and
                            the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Ball, Bundy and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AHG1">Ackley</persName> and I met on Saturday
                            in preparation for the Chancellor's visit<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">No record of this meeting was found.</note> and our
                            discussion has provided a background for the Chancellor's
                            visits to the various agencies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName> has cited the
                            international liquidity question as the principal reason for his visit.
                            This, however, appears to be largely for public consumption since it is
                            now apparent that his attention will center on Britain's
                            financial needs over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>As regards the liquidity question, which we certainly will touch upon and
                            again consider at the annual meeting of the Bank and Fund in September,
                            we will expect to learn the results of the Chancellor's
                            recent meeting with French Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_GEV1">Giscard</persName> d'Estaing.<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">A memorandum of a June 30 conversation between

                            resolve to hold further bilateral discussions in quiet fashion at the
                            staff level to coordinate our thinking—but without the danger
                            of inciting continental European suspicions that an Anglo Saxon scheme
                            is being contrived.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Britain's position over the past two decades or
                            more has been so weak, its reserves so low, and its liquid debts so
                            heavy that it has been plunging repeatedly into payments crises. So
                            sensitive and fragile is the world's confidence in sterling
                            that the publication a few days ago of disappointing trade figures for
                            one month triggered losses of nearly $200 million in three days.</p>
                        <p>With a country virtually evenly divided politically, no government has
                            been strong enough to carry out the economic policies required to <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0527"/>eliminate this basic weakness.
                            The British public remains, even today, apparently unconcerned at the
                            bleak outlook. Wilson and his colleagues have taken one measure after
                            another since coming into office in October. A listing of these actions
                            sounds imposing, but the measures have been taken in bits and pieces as
                            forced on them by the continuing deterioration of the payments
                            situation, and each has been cut short of the degree of severity which
                            the international financial community thought necessary. Wage
                            settlements continue to provide for increases of more than six percent
                            per year. Prices are still rising about 4-1/2 percent. There are more
                            job vacancies than unemployed.</p>
                        <p>At the end of May the Government of the United Kingdom had external debts
                            of more than $16 billion, including more than $8 billion net in liquid
                            sterling liabilities. Official reserves were $2,850 million and there
                            were fairly readily realizable assets of about $2,350
                            million—about $5.2 million in all. These second-line assets
                            included a U.S. dollar securities portfolio worth about $1,350 million,
                            a short-term line of credit with the Federal Reserve System of $750
                            million, and a general loan commitment from the Export-Import Bank of
                            $250 million. The British have, for all practical purposes, exhausted
                            their recourse to the International Monetary Fund and have been told by
                            European officials that it would be politically impossible for them to
                            extend further credit under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> has set as his target
                            payments equilibrium in the second half of 1966. Six weeks ago, British
                            authorities were estimating that $800 to $900 million would be needed to
                            meet Britain's own basic deficit in this period and the calls
                            upon the United Kingdom by other countries in the sterling area. A
                            revival of confidence in sterling could bring large reflows of funds but
                            continuing speculation could greatly enlarge the requirement.</p>
                        <p>The outlook is not very promising in the absence of more decisive British
                            measures to correct its position, measures that will prove convincing to
                            the continent—the source to which both the British and we
                            must look for credit to finance some substantial part of our respective
                            deficits. I think it would be a mistake to concentrate in our
                            discussions on the short-run problem and will therefore seek to focus
                            discussion on the British outlook over the next two or three years. I
                            intend to draw attention to the fact that our capacity to give financial
                            assistance is quite limited and that the approach toward a multilateral
                            solution which could materially ease the British position for a two or
                            three-year period, while simultaneously handling its shorter term
                            problem, should be undertaken. We will support British initiative to
                            gain this end and cooperate with other countries in making financial
                            resources available. The British will undoubtedly face continental
                            resistance toward giving it assistance in the absence of further firm
                            measures—but these are in <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0528"/>all likelihood necessary in any event and an early
                            approach by the British to the continent is most important and
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>A multilateral approach on a longer term program, say, three or four
                            years financing, would buttress British reserves and thus help also to
                            meet more immediate pressures on sterling that now seem quite likely to
                            develop. It would also assist in removing the recurrent sterling problem
                            as a factor restraining discussions on international liquidity
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>To ease its problem, the British officials may also seek added help in
                            meeting its defense commitments around the world. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is very firm that the United
                            States cannot take over any part of these British commitments, although
                            we will in close cooperative fashion seek to work out a program which
                            will assist in financing British military costs in a way which does no
                            substantial damage to our own balance of payments position.</p>
                        <p>British determination and initiative, together with our strong support
                            might secure on a multilateral basis the substantial amount of
                            medium-term assistance that Britain requires. I will want to emphasize
                            that no time should be lost in organizing this program.<note n="4" xml:id="d243fn4">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName>, July 1, is in the Johnson

                        <p>The Chancellor began the discussion by a reference to the recent U.K.
                            Cabinet decision to the effect that by 1970 the U.K. will be operating
                            within a defense budget of two billion pounds at 1964 prices. At the
                            present time a number of defense reviews are under way which will be
                            completed and brought before the Cabinet in a few months time. The
                            defense budget for this year has been brought down to 2.2 billion pounds
                            within existing commitments by overhauling defense procurement and by
                            deferring for five years payments for the planes being procured from the
                            U.S. A number of options have been considered, but not yet by the
                            Cabinet, with respect to further reducing the current 2.2 billion to 2
                            billion pounds. The Chancellor gave the assurance that the problem was
                            being approached with a sense of responsibility and the U.K. Government
                            would consult with the U.S. at regular intervals. The Chancellor was
                            complimentary about the efforts of Henry Kuss both as a salesman and in
                            attempting to facilitate U.S. purchases from the U.K. The Chancellor
                            said that the Minister of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>, was considering appointing someone on the
                            British side with comparable responsibilities. The Chancellor referred
                            in this connection to the possibility of the U.K. building ships for the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>On German offset purchases, the Chancellor said that a report just
                            received from Mr. Diamond who has been discussing the problem in Bonn
                            indicated some progress had been made. Sir Denis Rickett said the
                            Germans have agreed to extend the offset agreement until April 1967 and
                            to make an advance payment to the U.K. for offset purchases of 600
                            million <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>. The Germans have also agreed
                            to assist German importers with credit arrangements. Sir Denis said that
                            he lacked information at the present time with which to assess the
                            degree of assistance provided by these arrangements.</p>
                        <p>In summarizing the foreign exchange aspects of the British defense burden
                            the Chancellor said that it was costing 85 million pounds to maintain
                            the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>. Military aid and various
                            other stationing costs in the Middle East and Far East brought the total
                            to 304 million pounds. In addition the U.K. is providing 195 million
                            pounds in economic loans and grants. The total of foreign exchange cost
                            of defense and economic aid expenditures amounts to 500 million pounds
                            per annum.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that
                            there are two aspects of the U.K. defense problem—one is
                            budgetary and the other is with respect to the balance of payments. He
                            said that we strongly urge the U.K. to achieve its reduction of the
                            defense budget to the 2 billion pound level without altering any of its
                            political commitments. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was convinced this could be done, that
                            we were prepared to be helpful in discussing ways of eliminating
                            duplication of effort between the U.S. and the U.K. He mentioned
                            informally in this connection the possibility of eliminating the present
                            duplication of effort of our two navies in the Greenland North Cape
                            area. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            stressed again in the strongest terms the fact that our people will not
                            permit us to become in the future the sole policeman of the world. If
                            the U.K. were to cut its political commitments in Germany or in the area
                            between Aden and Hong Kong we would have to readjust our alliance
                            obligations with deleterious effect on our own, on U.K. and on
                            free-world interests.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> described the
                            decision of Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> on the cancellation of the TSR-2 as courageous
                            politically and at the same time absolutely right. He suggested that
                            other, similarly difficult decisions would have to be taken by the U.K.
                            For example, a decision to reduce naval costs through readjustments in
                            deployment would undoubtedly be difficult politically. We would be
                            prepared to inform <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> if the
                            U.K. were to so decide that the U.S. would take over sole responsibility
                            for maintaining the naval barriers in the North Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>On the foreign exchange aspects of the defense problem Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the U.S.
                            accepts the British objectives and is prepared to help by buying more
                            from the U.K. In order to counteract domestic <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0531"/>political pressures it will be
                            necessary for us in explaining increased U.S. purchases from the U.K. to
                            publicize the amount of U.K. purchases from the U.S. He said he knew
                            this would cause problems for the U.K., but it was necessary
                            domestically. We can buy more from the U.K., and we are prepared to
                            re-examine existing credit arrangements with a view to improving the
                            terms. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            that everything he had said about our being helpful was conditional on
                            there being no change in Britain's world-wide political
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he fully
                            agreed with what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had said. While Western Europe has been growing
                            in economic strength an attrition of these countries'
                            commitments around the world has created a series of power vacuums which
                            we have had to fill. We recognize the British problem, but we cannot
                            accept a further extension of our own commitments.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor stressed that he regards the British defense problem as
                            primarily a foreign exchange problem at the present time. He said he was
                            mindful that the evil day had only been put off by the arrangements for
                            purchase of U.S. aircraft. If the foreign exchange burden cannot be
                            borne, this will have the most serious consequences not just in the
                            defense field but across the board. He said he would speak as frankly as
                            Secretary McNamara had done. The U.K. cannot continue to carry the
                            present foreign exchange burden and it must come down. It affects the
                            entire British economy. At the same time the Chancellor emphasized that
                            he wants the U.K. to go on playing its role—there is no other
                            country prepared to do what the U.S. and the U.K. are doing.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor referred to the possibility of developments in Aden and
                            Malaysia making it more difficult for the U.K. to continue to discharge
                            its responsibilities in those areas. He mentioned that the Tunku had not
                            always had his present attitude toward the British presence. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> interjected at this
                            point the observation that absolutely and without any qualifications the
                            U.S. could not accept any further commitment with respect to Malaysia.
                            We are already over extended in Asia. He said that both Australia and
                            the Philippines could do more than they have been doing.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s remarks about the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> and asked what we would regard as an
                            unacceptable reduction in its strength. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he saw no room
                            for a reduction, although he could envisage the possibility of temporary
                            withdrawals at the brigade level to deal with emergencies elsewhere. He
                            said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would collapse militarily if
                            during the next three years French pressures to change its organization
                            coincided with British pressures to reduce the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> suggested the
                            possibility of a greater German contribution. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that the Germans could
                            help more with the costs of the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>
                            but not by replacing it. He also suggested that the U.K. might have been
                            more active in pushing sales to the Germans and so resisting the recent
                            one million <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> reduction in the Federal
                            Republic's defense budget. He urged that after the German
                            elections the U.S. and the U.K. should together press the Federal
                            Republic to do more than it has been doing.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the Chancellor, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he was not sure
                            about economies which might be achieved through US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> cooperation with respect to the Army and
                            Air Force. However, he mentioned the big increase in our air lift and
                            air refueling capabilities and raised the possibility of the U.K.
                            contracting with us for provision of services of this character.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he would faithfully report this discussion to the
                            Defense Minister on his return to the U.K. He gave the assurance that
                            there would be no suddenly-announced British decisions in the defense
                            field and that there would be plenty of time afforded for Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to express his
                            views.</p>

                                he commented: “Rowen's memorandum shows that
                                the Trend visit was cancelled because of Cabinet worry over
                                consultation with Americans before Cabinet decisions are taken. This
                                has a Skybolt flavor to me, and I have suggested to Dick Neustadt
                                that the Prime Minister ought to bare his soul to <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName>, if he

                            Cabinet takes the decision”). However, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mitchell</persName> told Dick that the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> regards Trend as a good
                            go-between—but he shouldn't come right now.</p>
                        <p>Dick conveyed appropriate points to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mitchell</persName> including <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David
                                Bruce</persName>'s suitability as a trusted intermediary.
                            Dick stressed that we didn't expect to be told of a Cabinet
                            “decision” before the Cabinet but that we valued
                            outlines of the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'s thinking.
                            Also that the President can't be expected to embrace the
                            Pound until <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> comes up with its overall
                            economic and defense program. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mitchell</persName> said <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> not
                            thinking of unilateral troop reductions in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> (cooperative reductions another matter), that <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> thinks devaluation beyond bounds of
                            possibility, and that maybe <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mitchell</persName> or Oliver Wright could usefully visit
                            Washington on occasion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Office</hi>: The Foreign Office people we saw
                            (Gore-Booth-Caccia's successor—Chalfont, Palliser,
                            John Thomson, Arthur) say, with varying degrees of firmness and
                            specificity, that foreign commitments will be cut. They don't
                            believe that Healey can get close to the 2000 million pounds defense
                            ceiling through efficiency gains. The most specific and drastic view
                            (Thomson's—partly prescriptive, partly predictive)
                            was <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0534"/>that Britain should/would
                            over the next five years: 1) get out of Malta, 2) get out of Libya, 3)
                            get out of the base in Cyprus supporting Libya, 4) out of Aden, 5) out
                            of Persian Gulf (or perhaps support Gulf from Indian Ocean bases), 6)
                            expect—and welcome—being invited out of Malaysia
                            as part of an Indonesian-Malaysian “settlement,”
                            7) build up base in Northern Australia, 8) build Indian Ocean bases, 9)
                            stay in Europe. I sense agreement by the <gloss target="#t_FO1">FO</gloss> types that Aden is first on the list and that European
                            commitments should be kept.</p>
                        <p>It isn't clear to what extent the Foreign Office believes
                            these cuts inevitable because they think the Defense Review will force
                            them, or because they think that the Cabinet will force these cuts
                            anyway, or because they think that the Americans should be told cuts are
                            coming for tactical reasons. In any case Healey's line is
                            different.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Healey</hi>: He says that 50% of the needed savings
                            have already been found (aircraft and subs), that he expects to find 25%
                            in efficiency gains and that 25% will come out of reducing commitments.
                            The Cabinet will get a proposal on streamlining reserve forces next
                            week, and a big decision on land versus sea-based air by September.
                            (This one had to wait for the Earl of Burma to go. They also want to
                            know if US has some carriers in reserve that can handle their
                            Phantoms.)</p>
                        <p>Once these decisions are taken, further reductions will involve
                            commitments. But not much. For example,
                            “confrontation” with Indonesia would involve 1/2
                            Army, 3/4 Air Force, 90% Navy; therefore they can't cut much
                            unless “confrontation” can be ended. (Healey
                            expressed unhappiness on present strategy versus Indonesia and ran
                            through alternatives—escalate, negotiate out, turn over to
                            Malaysia. He and a lot of his people would like out but clearly
                            don't see it happening in short run.)</p>
                        <p>Far East and South Asia: He is trying to figure out (ex-Indonesia) what
                            role makes sense. He is thinking mainly about little problems and
                            focuses on Australia. They are talking with the Aussies about a base in
                            the North, see need to do joint planning including use of Australia
                            F-111's and its carrier, and want to concert with US and NZ
                            as well.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Mid East</hi>: He had thought that UK would have to
                            leave Aden by '68 and move into Gulf. He now thinks that
                            permanent basing in Gulf won't work and that a post
                            '68 base in Aden may work.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Healey did not suggest major
                            reductions in Germany (by implication, even failing 1-3 above). On
                            contrary, he said cheaper (in budget but not foreign exchange) to keep
                            troops there, and they are usable strategic reserve for elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>You will have heard by now of the measures which we introduced on
                                Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">Following 2 days of heavy losses
                                by the pound, the British Government on July 27 announced a third,
                                emergency budget with heavy spending cuts in all areas, including
                                defense. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                                met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>
                                that day and indicated his desire for a meeting with the President.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> reported:
                                “I told him frankly that I had no idea whatever as to how
                                such a proposal would be received, but it would seem to me it should
                                be explored further before he took it up officially.”
                                (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>
                                Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> with the object of steadying
                            confidence. They have already had some effect and I hope that it will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Politically this has been a very difficult operation indeed. Deferment of
                            important social projects, introduction of building licensing,
                            tightening up of hire purchase terms and exchange control, and so on,
                            make a tough package. Many of my colleagues were resistant to what I
                            considered necessary and, since the announcement, there has been a lot
                            of unrest among our supporters in Parliament and outspoken opposition by
                            the Trades Union Congress. The support of the Confederation <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0536"/>of British Industries and the
                            recognition by our Financial Times, with its specialized leadership,
                            that the measures showed the Government's determination to
                            put the strength of Sterling before politics, are things that count both
                            ways for a Labour Government—particularly when it is far from
                            certain that there is a case of objective economic grounds for more than
                            a minor degree of deflation. But I am determined to face up to our
                            overriding problem of maintaining confidence to the limit.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately there may be more breakers ahead. For example, a single
                            month's bad trade figures could cause a dangerous run.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this I am very concerned about the wider outlook for international
                            liquidity, and in particular by the French veto on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s call for an
                            international monetary conference. If this is carried any further we
                            shall have a situation in which the French will be trying to blackmail
                            the rest of the Free World in a matter vital to economic expansion.</p>
                        <p>I know how deeply pre-occupied you are with Vietnam, as I am with Aden
                            and Malaysia, but I believe that these economic problems, and in
                            particular the threat that hangs over us, are also of great importance
                            for the Free World and that we must keep in close touch on them. Sir

                        <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> positions add up as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. East of Suez and <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> are sacrosanct
                            (by and large);</p>
                        <p>b. $2.80 is sacrosanct;</p>
                        <p>c. no <hi rend="italic">pre</hi>-crisis preventive package is
                            obtainable;</p>
                        <p>d. an emergency rescue package, in the face of a crisis, must be
                            multilateral—we will not foot the bill without substantial
                            help from others. (Substantial: Fowler—2/3;
                            Ball—1/4?)</p>
                        <p>e. no multilateral rescue package is obtainable unless the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> takes still further steps to compress
                            internal demand, etc.</p>
                        <p>f. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops in Vietnam, while not
                            strictly a necessary condition for us to be forthcoming on sterling,
                            would greatly improve the odds.</p>
                        <p>On a strict construction—and even if we leave out
                            Vietnam—the position is that they must under no circumstances
                            devalue, or impose comprehensive trade and exchange controls, or cut
                            back on East Suez or on the Rhine, yet we will not take part in a rescue
                            operation unless they are prepared sharply to deflate at home.</p>
                        <p>2. As a shopping list of objectives—of what we should like
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>—this is
                            unexceptional if incomplete: one would want to add sensible <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> handling of the Germans on nuclear
                            arrangements, proliferation, unification, and perhaps even some things
                            on the Kennedy Round. But as a bargaining strategy, it is badly askew.
                            We cannot hold both to $2.80 and to
                            no-rescue-without-painful—internal-measures as absolute
                            objectives. In a crisis, Wilson might just decide that devaluation would
                            be better than the alternative we might wish to impose in return for
                            rescue-money. More likely, he will simply tell us that either we come
                            through with a rescue package on what he would regard reasonable terms,
                            or he would have to cut loose.</p>
                        <p>3. The point here is not one of tactics, e.g., of what we say to the
                            British now, but one of preparing the President's mind and
                            getting a reading on his priorities. Assuming that they do not come
                            through on <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0538"/>Vietnam, but that
                            they are prepared to promise to stay on the Rhine and East of Suez:</p>
                        <p>a. Would he prefer to bail out the British with the U.S. putting in the
                            bulk of the money even if they will not promise the internal measures
                            that are needed to avoid another crisis a few months later? In other
                            words, are we prepared simply to underwrite $2.80 indefinitely?</p>
                        <p>b. If not, it is useless to say to ourselves that devaluation is
                            unthinkable. It had better become thinkable, not only in the contingency
                            group, but also in the minds of the principals and the President.</p>
                        <p>4. The interesting question, assuming that I am right that the President
                            would opt for (b) above and not (a), is one of tactics. Does it really
                            make sense to hold to the <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                            line of laughing off any talk of devaluation? My own recommendation
                            would be to make very clear just how bad we think any devaluation would
                            be, but to begin conditioning them to the need to keep any change in
                            rate, if it does happen, small—small enough to give us a
                            reasonable chance to hold the rest of the Group of Ten from also going
                            down, and, also, to the need to complement devaluation with further
                            internal measures.</p>
                        <p>5. The premise of all the above is that, for <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>, there are some things worse than devaluation. If
                            I'm wrong—if he makes an absolute objective of
                            $2.80—then of course we are in the saddle and can impose
                            whatever terms we wish when he comes for help on a Friday evening. But I
                            am inclined to think that, even apart from extreme political demands,
                            that the proposition that devaluation would be a total and certain
                            disaster for Wilson is wrong. My guess would be that he might have a
                            better chance to survive if he does a relatively small devaluation, with
                            some complementary internal demand compression, than if he holds out at
                            $2.80, takes Draconian measures, and gets the bankers to ante up for 90
                            days.</p>

                        <p rend="center">RELATIVE TO STERLING PROBLEM</p>
                        <p>There are three main possibilities:</p>
                        <p>1. Maintenance of present rate, which probably will require some further
                            outside assistance</p>
                        <p>2. Moderate devaluation (10-15 per cent)</p>
                        <p>3. Large devaluation (20-30 per cent)</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Maintenance of present rate</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In our judgment, <hi rend="italic">this is the preferable course</hi>.
                            The present British program probably would produce equilibrium if left
                            to work without speculative raids. However, it is unlikely that raids
                            will cease until people become convinced that the program is working.
                            Therefore, there is likely to be need for additional finance and for
                            additional measures on their part—partly to secure the
                            additional finance and partly to convince people that <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> is determined to save
                            sterling.</p>
                        <p>Our judgment is that we should insist on a <hi rend="italic">wage-price-dividend freeze</hi> in order to obtain more
                            finance—from us and the Continent—and to give
                            confidence a boost. Our share of a proposed finance package of $2.5
                            billion would be $700 million. We would acquire Sterling up to this
                            amount. It would be guaranteed as to exchange value. The cost to us
                            would be small.</p>
                        <p>B. Moderate devaluation (10-15 per cent)</p>
                        <p>If devaluation could be kept to a moderate figure and if industrial
                            Europe, Japan, and Canada did not follow, the costs of a small
                            devaluation—while greater than the cost of saving Sterling,
                            would not be unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>It would not seriously damage our trading position. Our major concern
                            would be with the derivative effects—</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>the danger of depreciation by Canada, Japan, and the major Continental
                            countries; financial speculation against the dollar and buying of gold
                            by nervous central banks. We would take the following action:</p>
                        <p>1. Seek a formal public pronouncement, during the crisis weekend, that
                            the Group of Ten will maintain their exchange rates. Such announcements
                            would be concerted either by telephone or by urgent sessions. There is a
                            good chance that the Group of Ten could be persuaded to stand firm.
                            Canada, Japan, and Sweden would require particular attention.</p>
                        <p>2. We would maintain close contact with all major countries to assure
                            cooperative action in reassuring markets, handling hot money, and
                            avoiding conversions into gold—being careful to avoid any
                            impression that gold is not available on demand.</p>
                        <p>3. Since the broad theme of this approach would be to restore as quickly
                            as possible the atmosphere of “business as usual,”
                            the United States would announce no change in its policy of gold
                            conversion and be ready to meet any demands for gold from any central
                            bank. This might result in a considerable amount of gold loss, at least
                            temporarily, but would permit the present monetary system to operate
                            until we are clear what improvements are desired.</p>
                        <p>4. In line with this approach, the gold pool should continue its
                            operations in the London Market, though perhaps permitting wider
                            fluctuations in the price of gold, under careful control.</p>
                        <p>5. The Treasury would indicate to the United Kingdom that we would expect
                            them to take Roosa-type bonds or to hold dollars rather than buy gold
                            with any return flow of capital.</p>
                        <p>The costs of devaluation not followed by the major countries probably
                            would be nervous foreign exchange markets and some conversion of dollars
                            into gold—perhaps of the order of $1 to $2 billion.</p>
                        <p>If other industrial nations followed the costs to us would be far
                            greater——both in terms of trade position and in
                            terms of gold loss. The consequences would be essentially the same as of
                            a large devaluation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Major devaluation (20—30 per
                            cent)</p>
                        <p>If the United Kingdom devalued by 20 per cent or more, most major and
                            minor countries would follow. The costs would be unpredictable, but
                            certainly very great. In our judgment a major devaluation of Sterling
                            would cost far too much for us and for the world.</p>
                        <p>But if it happens, the following steps would be necessary:</p>
                        <p>1. Suspension of gold sales but no change in the dollar price of gold. In
                            essence, this would leave the dollar to float free against other
                            currencies.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>2. An attempt to negotiate new exchange rates with major countries, and
                            reciprocal credit arrangements to protect the agreed rates.</p>
                        <p>3. Be prepared to threaten retaliation if others impose trade
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>A large devaluation would put in jeopardy the entire structure of trade
                            and payments which we have worked so hard to build since World War II.
                            It could easily have serious long—term consequences for the
                            U.S. domestic economy as well as for our world trading position. With
                            skill and courage, we could perhaps put the system back together. But it
                            would not be easy.</p>

                        <p>Last night at about 11 p.m. London time, the Bank of England and the
                            Chancellor of the Exchequer wrapped up a multilateral package to support
                            the pound sterling. The package should total between $900 million and $1
                            billion with the exact amounts and form of participation of some
                            countries not yet finally settled. The countries participating are
                            Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Sweden,
                            Switzerland, and the United States, plus the Bank for International
                            Settlements. The Bank of France was originally in the package but pulled
                            out of the deal yesterday morning.</p>
                        <p>United States participation in the package will total roughly $400
                            million in line with our agreement. This amount will be divided between
                            the Federal Reserve and the Exchange Stabilization Fund of the
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Reserve Bank in New York began operations this morning in the
                            spot sterling market and very limited operations have brought good
                            results thus far in terms of a higher rate for sterling. The rate has
                            moved from 2.7918 to a recent bid of 2.7940. We are hoping that this
                            improvement in the rate will give the speculators [no?] reason for
                            concern and by accelerating a return of the confidence in sterling will
                            trigger a re—flow of funds to the United Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>This negotiation has been much more difficult than that of last November
                            but we are hopeful that the package will carry the pound through the
                            uncertainties of the next few months.</p>
                        <p>While this operation has started well, the first real test may come as
                            early as Monday or Tuesday, when the British trade figures will be

                            British on Singapore and our support of the pound. You will not need to
                            read the account of George's argumentation, but you will want
                            to look at the sidelined account of the British responses on both
                                subjects.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">The 3d through 11th paragraphs

                            Wilson to agree to the association between our defense of the pound and
                            their overseas commitments. The one thing which he was apparently trying
                            to avoid was a liability in Vietnam, and you will recall that it was
                            your own wisdom that prevented us from making any such connection
                            earlier in the summer, although I did once informally say to one of the
                            Prime Minister's people that a battalion would be worth a

                            <gloss target="#t_Exdis1">Exdis</gloss>. During the last two days Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> have had extensive
                            discussion regarding Singapore and Malaysia and the quadripartite
                            meeting convened by Her Majesty's Government. This telegram
                            will report the essence of these conversations with Foreign Secretary
                            Stewart on September 8, with the Prime Minister later in the day on
                            September 8 and with the Prime Minister again on September 9, including
                            the relation of this problem to UK current financial difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In the course of these conversations, the Under Secretary strongly
                            challenged the British assumption that the secession of Singapore called
                            for urgent contingency planning regarding the maintenance of the British
                            position and the continuance of British defense commitments in the area.
                            He stated that the quadripartite meeting was regarded by Washington as
                            both premature and hazardous. If it became known in any of the relevant
                            capitals that the British were seriously considering alternatives to
                            Singapore, the Western position would be greatly weakened. The Under
                            Secretary made clear that the U. S. did not share the British sense that
                            their position was in imminent danger because of recent political
                            events. He emphasized the increasing American commitment in Southeast
                            Asia and made clear that the American people would not understand that
                            at the same time the British were considering a diminution of their
                            commitment in the same area. He pointed out in detail the disastrous
                            consequences if the word should be spread that Western power might be
                            withdrawn or diminished. He made clear that any efforts to explore with
                            Sukarno a possible end to the confrontation would be regarded as
                            evidence of weakness by Indonesia and thus lead Sukarno (and the
                            Communists) to feel that their bloody-mindedness was justified by
                            events. He indicated strongly that the use of Japan in an intermediary
                            role might well contribute to Japanese neutrals.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>The response of the British—both the Foreign Secretary and
                            later the Prime Minister—was directed at the contingency
                            nature of British planning. The underlying British concern was that the
                            future behavior of Lee could not be precisely predicted. They did not
                            know whether or not he might seek to align himself with the Afro-Asian
                            powers. They felt therefore that some kind of contingency planning was
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>At the same time both the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister
                            categorically rejected the idea that they were seeking an easy way out
                            of British commitments.</p>
                        <p>They therefore felt that Four-Power talks might be useful, not for the
                            purpose of preparing a British withdrawal, but rather with the intention
                            of developing alternative courses of action in the event that the
                            Singapore base proved untenable.</p>
                        <p>The end result of the Under Secretary's conversations with
                            both the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister was a categorical
                            assurance that the United Kingdom had no present intention of reducing
                            its commitments in Southeast Asia, but that it was merely seeking to
                            develop alternative arrangements in the event that the use of the
                            Singapore base was progressively circumscribed. Both the Foreign
                            Secretary and the Prime Minister also indicated clearly that they had
                            dropped the idea of any negotiations to end the confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary felt that as a result of his conversations the
                            British had clearly gotten the word that the quadripartite talks had
                            been misconceived and that neither the U.S. nor Australia had any
                            intention of letting the British off the hook in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>In the Under Secretary's discussion with the Prime Minister on
                            Wednesday, September 8, the Under Secretary vigorously pressed the
                            argument that the U.S. regarded the maintenance of British commitments
                            around the world as an essential element in the total Anglo-American
                            relationship. In response, the Prime Minister insisted that no clear
                            link could be made between the U.S. efforts to assist Sterling and a
                            common approach to foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>To clear up the American position on the point, the Under Secretary
                            arranged for Ambassador Bruce and himself to have a private talk with
                            the Prime Minister following the Prime Minister's meeting
                            with Secretary Fowler later on the evening of Thursday, September 9.
                            During this private conversation which lasted for almost an hour, the
                            Under Secretary and the Ambassador made emphatically clear that the U.S.
                            Government considered that the Anglo-American relationship must be
                            regarded as a totality, in which each element of the relationship should
                            be given weight and each related to the other.</p>
                        <p>Thus it would be a great mistake if the United Kingdom failed to
                            understand that the American effort to relieve Sterling was inextricably
                            related to the commitment of the United Kingdom to maintain its <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0545"/>commitments around the world.
                            All of the U.S. Government activities in relation to Sterling or the
                            economic problems of the United Kingdom were necessarily related to the
                            commitment of the two Governments to engage together in a 5-year review
                            of the United Kingdom's defense program.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed to all of this, noting that he had expressed
                            his earlier qualifications merely to make the record clear that the
                            United Kingdom would not accept an additional demand for a United
                            Kingdom contribution to Vietnam as a quid pro quo for U.S. Government
                            short-term assistance for Sterling. He readily admitted that all aspects
                            of the relationship of the two Governments must be considered as a
                            totality in any long-range review of the United Kingdom defense
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The other subjects discussed by the Under Secretary with the Foreign
                            Secretary were Kashmir, Vietnam, and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. These subjects will be reported by the Under
                            Secretary upon his return to Washington.</p>

                        <p>The following is a list of the meetings in which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> participated during his visit to
                            Washington:</p>

                            and Prime Minister alone for approximately an hour and thereafter with
                            officials.</p>

                            Minister at the British Embassy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">December 17</hi>—1:00-3:30 p.m. Lunch at
                            White House with conversation continuing thereafter. President and Prime
                            Minister spoke privately before lunch.</p>
                        <p>The notes are based on the comments of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> who attended some but
                            not all of the meetings listed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> was present at the White House on December 16 and
                            also attended the lunch on December 17. He was not present at the
                            meeting at the British Embassy the morning of December 16 which was
                            largely concerned with the British defense review. Assistant Secretary
                            Leddy attended only the lunch on December 17 and the discussion which
                            followed.</p>

                        <p>This subject was discussed on both days with the Prime Minister
                            expressing his appreciation for US backing, particularly on the oil
                            sanctions and the airlift for Zambia.<note n="2" xml:id="d252fn2">For

                                Documents, 1965, pp. 693-694.</note> (In his press briefing on
                            December 17, the Prime Minister said in response to a question that
                            United States planes would be used in the airlift.) The Prime Minister
                            took an optimistic view of the prospects of bringing down the Smith
                            regime in a short time through economic action. While the Prime Minister
                            did not give a specific time estimate, Oliver Wright subsequently told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> that the
                            British Government hoped to achieve this result in a matter of
                            weeks.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">British Defense Review</p>
                        <p>At the White House meetings attended by officials the Prime Minister did
                            not go into details on the defense review but said he understood the
                            importance we attach to a continuation of British defense commitments
                            and gave assurances that the British world-wide role would be
                            maintained. He said that there would be readjustments in the British
                            defense posture East of Suez but that they would maintain their
                            presence. In the long run, Singapore might become very tricky and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had no real assurance that it
                            could be used in case of need. As a consequence the British Government
                            had been considering the possibility of an alternative base in Northern
                            Australia. The Australians, he said, had shown interest in this
                            possibility. He expressed interest in the possibility of defense talks
                            with Australia and New Zealand and, by implication, with the US on the
                            defense problems of the area. The Prime Minister indicated that he was
                            thinking, in connection with a base in Australia, of the post 1970
                            period. With respect to Aden, the Prime Minister said that this could
                            not be regarded as a long-term base. In the Persian Gulf there continues
                            to be a need to afford some protection to Iran and Kuwait. The Prime
                            Minister thought Bahrein would have some use in this connection but that
                            generally it should be possible to lighten the British presence in the
                            Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> noted that the
                            Prime Minister was careful in phrasing his remarks on the defense review
                            to indicate a desire to have our comments while avoiding any commitment
                            that British decisions would conform to our views. In the meeting at the
                            British Embassy on the morning of December 17, it was agreed that
                            Foreign Secretary Stewart and Defense Minister Healey would visit
                            Washington in January for more detailed talks with Secretary Rusk and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Sharing</p>
                        <p>This subject was apparently discussed privately by the President and the
                            Prime Minister. In the subsequent discussion with officials on December
                            16, the Prime Minister said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            preferred a consultative arrangement to a
                            “hardware” solution but that if necessary it was
                            prepared to support its 1964 proposal for an <gloss target="#t_ANF1">ANF</gloss>. The Prime Minister indicated that he and the President
                            would have further contact on the nuclear problem in the Alliance as the
                            situation developed and after the President had discussed the matter
                            with Chancellor Erhard.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>In replying to press queries the Prime Minister took a strong line in
                            support of US efforts to pursue peace in Vietnam and said that his
                            Government was quite satisfied with the willingness repeatedly expressed
                            by the United States to go to the conference table. He cited the <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0548"/>efforts made by his Government
                            to bring about negotiations and said these efforts would continue with
                            the full support of the President. These press responses were along the
                            lines earlier indicated by the Prime Minister in talks with the
                            President and US officials. The discussions reflected continued
                            understanding and support for the US position in Southeast Asia and
                            appreciation on our part that notwithstanding domestic political
                            pressures the Wilson Government has been constant in maintaining this
                            attitude. The Prime Minister did, however, indicate that any bombing of
                            Hanoi or Haiphong would create the most serious problems for him and his
                            Government in determining what line they would be obliged to adopt.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the discussions with US officials the British agreed to
                            give further consideration to increasing their contribution to the Asian
                            Development Bank from $10 million to $30 million.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing appear to be the principal subjects covered in the
                            discussions although other matters such as the India-Pakistan dispute
                            were also touched on briefly.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Attached is a memorandum for the record<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Not
                                found.</note> on the purported British position for the talks which
                            will be held next week.</p>
                        <p>1. The British apparently have in mind three new elements in their
                            relation to the Far East: (a) increased de facto interdependence East of
                            Suez, through intensified staff talks and other consultations; (b) a
                            formal linkage of the UK to the Far East via <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>; and (c) assignment to Asia of the British Polaris
                            submarines.</p>
                        <p>2. I find no objection to their first proposal; but I feel strong
                            reservations on the other two proposals for the reasons stated
                            below.</p>
                        <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0549"/>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Underlying <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                                Objectives</hi>. The British propose to have us pay a high price for
                            what they intend, in any case, to do; that is, to shift from Singapore
                            in a few years and then cut down their Far East presence to an
                            Australian air-naval base. The price they seek from us consists in: as
                            firm an institutionalized grip as they can manage on U.S. policy in the
                            Far East; U.S. financial assistance; and the right to continue to
                            maintain their national nuclear deterrent.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Interests</hi>. It is our interest to maintain
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence in the Far East during
                            the Viet Nam war—both in Singapore and in Malaysia. Over the
                            longer term it is our interest to work out a viable basis for containing
                            Communist China based on the systemic mobilization of Asian and European
                            as well as U.S. resources. Our agreement to the British second and third
                            proposals is not required to effect our primary short-run interest; that
                            is, to keep the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the Far East in the
                            short run. They are locked into the Far East by their confrontation in
                            Malaysia. After that confrontation ends, they will cut down their forces
                            irrespective of what we do. There is no political basis in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for keeping 45,000 ground troops East of
                            Suez except in defense of Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>5. The British proposals run counter to our long-run interests in the Far
                            East.</p>
                        <p>a. If we become too formally involved with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> via a treaty structure or assignment to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Polaris submarines of important Chinese
                            Communist targets, we will be moving towards something close to a
                            British veto over our China policy. It is highly unlikely that domestic
                            politics will allow any government in London to go to war against
                            mainland China; and we could count on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> influence consistently to make difficult any firm stand
                            vis-é-vismainland China.</p>
                        <p>b. The British joining <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> would
                            create a white man's club in Asia. It would antagonize not
                            merely the Indonesian military but other Asians as well and make more
                            difficult our long-run task of building an effective security grouping
                            in Asia for the containment of China.</p>
                        <p>c. Acceptance of the British proposal would turn the British away from
                            Europe and turn the continental Europeans away from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. An Anglo-Saxon Asian defense club, built
                            on what appeared to be a special London-Washington relation, would
                            discourage rather than encourage other Europeans to move towards
                            responsibility in Asia. It would also complicate eventual <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry into Europe and deny the British
                            and ourselves the correct strategy of having British entry into Europe
                            serve as a way of leading Europe as a whole to assume increased
                            responsibilities East of Suez and on the world scene.</p>
                        <p>6. In these three ways acceptance of the British proposals would make our
                            tasks of containing Communist China more rather than less difficult.</p>
                        <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>. I conclude, therefore, that, in
                            dealing with the British proposals, we must distinguish sharply between
                            the short-run and long-run problems we face in Asia. We should be
                            forthcoming on short-term steps to help the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> stay East of Suez by financial assistance, staff talks,
                            etc. On the other hand, we should not allow the British to exploit our
                            short-term concerns in ways which would mortgage our long-term prospects
                            for effective U.S., Asian, and European action East of Suez.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador said he was returning to London for a brief
                            consultation on the defense review. He hoped to give us a piece of paper
                            setting forth the British position on January 25. The Secretary then
                            handed him the attached paper giving U.S. reactions to what we
                            understood to be the British position.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the contents of the U.S. paper, particularly
                            our view on the four-power arrangements in the Far East being proposed
                            by the British. The Secretary asked if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had in mind a formal arrangement requiring ratification
                            or more informal arrangements. He stated that a formal alliance would
                            cause problems for us. We would not like to get into the business of
                            amending any of our existing treaties.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said he thought the
                            Prime Minister had in mind some kind of agreement. Whether it would need
                            formal ratification he didn't know.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were anxious that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> keep its commitment to Malaysia and Singapore. If the
                            British presence in the Far East was connected only with the defense of
                            Australia, it didn't have much point to it.</p>

                        <p rend="center">INFORMAL NOTE ON UK DEFENSE REVIEW</p>
                        <p>1. On the basis of such indications as the U.S. has received concerning
                            the direction of British thinking, and in the absence of more specific
                            indications of British views, U.S. reactions are likely to be along the
                            following lines on certain important points:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>. As a general principle, the U.S. would
                            be unable to assume political or defense responsibilities in any area to
                            make up for the reduction in, or withdrawal of, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence. This would of course apply to
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Aden</hi>. We are likely to accept, with regret, the
                            probable necessity for their phasing out within the next few years; we
                            attach great importance to their maintaining an adequate military
                            capability in the general area of the Arabian Sea-Persian Gulf.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Singapore</hi>. This will need to be discussed at
                            length; the British presence there is regarded as of very great
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Four-Power Arrangements in the Far East</hi>. Formal
                            alliance arrangements in this area would raise many problems; a range of
                            other possibilities for collaboration might be explored.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. attaches importance to the maintenance by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of a balanced capability depending on a
                            suitable mix of forces to carry out <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            responsibilities in the area East of Suez.</p>
                        <p>3. The whole range of British overseas commitments and capabilities
                            should be discussed before the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> makes a
                            final decision.</p>

                            discussions are especially important now because it appears that today
                            only the United States and the United Kingdom among the Free World
                            countries are carrying the burden of world-wide security demands.
                            Accordingly, we particularly value this chance to discuss the issues
                            raised by the British and also to <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0553"/>expose our thinking on our strategy, commitments, and
                            plans. Mr. Rusk welcomed the British delegation and suggested that they
                            lead off the substantive discussion in any way they wished.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> thanked Secretary Rusk
                            and said he and his colleagues were very pleased to be in Washington.
                            They were happy the US participants feel able to discuss in detail and
                            in great frankness these problems of mutual concern. He suggested that
                            before moving on to the substantive problems, they might discuss how to
                            deal with the press. In general, the British don't want to
                            say much to the press at this stage; Mr. Healey is going on to
                            Australia, and it would be unfortunate if too much is said publicly
                            before he reaches Canberra. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> indicated that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> would be meeting with British
                            press representatives, on a non-attributable basis, after the talks
                            today. They intended to confine their remarks to the press mainly to
                            platitudes and generalities. He suggested that US and British press
                            officers might come in for instruction later in the morning. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought these
                            arrangements were appropriate and that we might meet with our respective
                            press officers toward the end of the morning meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> commented that essentially the
                            British want to be as polite and uninformative as possible in dealing
                            with the press. The subject matter of these discussions is extremely
                            confidential and false inferences could readily be drawn from premature
                            disclosures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that
                            we should say as little as possible to the press at this stage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> indicated that the
                            President had expressed the hope he could see Foreign Minister Stewart
                            and Defense Minister Healey during the course of the day, and we would
                            have information soon as to when this would be.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">The only record of this meeting found was a January

Most of
                                the conversation pertained to Vietnam. It seemed evident he expected
                                to resume bombing, but he wanted no reference made by those present
                                to his mentioning the subject.” (Department of State,

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> began the British
                            presentation by pointing out that the Ministers closely concerned, but
                            not the Cabinet as a whole, have now reached provisional conclusions on
                            the British Defense Review. After talks with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s allies concerned, the Cabinet will make its
                            decisions. He proposed to set out now the foreign policy assumptions on
                            which the British believe their Defense policy should be based. The
                            objective of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy is to provide for
                            the defense of the homeland, to contribute to the defense of neighboring
                            nations, and to assist other nations of the world who feel threatened
                            either by direct military aggression or by subversion. At the same time,
                            the British do not want to be in the position of defending every
                            existing regime in the Free <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0554"/>World; change is simply inevitable, and the requirement is to try to
                            promote change in an orderly fashion and to avoid getting more nations
                            drawn into the cold war struggle. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            policy envisages not only defending its homeland and closely allied
                            nations such as those in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, but also
                            concerning itself with the defense of other allied nations such as those
                            in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and of non-aligned countries who wish to maintain
                            their integrity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> continued that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has both strengths and weaknesses
                            in playing its part. First of all, there is the economic and financial
                            problem. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has been overstretched in
                            trying to maintain a range of commitments, and has been facing a serious
                            foreign exchange drain. The British Government is extremely anxious that
                            the UK should not run away from its proper responsibilities. However, if
                            British defense commitments create an unbearable strain, especially in
                            balance of payments terms, the result will be a weakening of the UK
                            position everywhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said another special
                            fact that bears on the British role is their past as an imperial power.
                            There are both advantages and disadvantages inherent in this heritage.
                            In some areas of the world the British are particularly vulnerable to
                            attack because of their past associations; in other areas their past
                            history gives them continued and substantial influence. The British have
                            been trying now to make a series of judgments as to which bits of their
                            former imperial holdings ought to be kept and which ought to be given
                            up. In making these judgments, they have tried to steer clear of
                            pre-conceived notions. There is simply no use in clinging to places
                            where there is strong local hostility to their presence and where this
                            would be a propaganda advantage to enemies. In other areas (the Persian
                            Gulf is an example), the British are the only people who can provide the
                            framework for orderly development. It is difficult to know how long the
                            British can continue to provide such a framework. We also must keep in
                            mind that some countries want British support but can't say
                            so publicly; an example is Singapore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said he would next like
                            to reduce these general considerations to more practical terms.</p>
                        <p>In Europe it is quite clear that, in view of obligations to allies and of
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy in Europe, there should not
                            be any reduction in British ground forces. There would be, however, some
                            reductions in the Air Force. He noted that a special problem in Europe
                            is the relationship between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. While there is a need for a
                            closer relationship between the two, there are problems. There is no
                            need to elaborate the obvious personal aspects involved in this
                            relationship; it is simply a fact that many Britons do not approach with
                            positive enthusiasm the idea of closer ties with Germany. However, this
                            attitude is lessening with time, and with the present government in
                            Germany this relationship would improve.</p>
                        <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0555"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> noted there is a
                            growing feeling in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is not paying its proper share of the
                            cost of the common defense. The British accept the fact that there is
                            not likely to be any German military contribution outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at present, but there is a need for
                            wider arrangements than offset for sharing of costs. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like to discuss in detail how we
                            can get other allies to carry a fair share of the defense and security
                            burden. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> expressed the
                            hope that diplomatically the US could help the British with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on this problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> noted that most
                            countries in the Middle East and North Africa area reject formal
                            alliance ties with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Exceptions to
                            this rule are Libya and Iran. On Libya, the British view is that
                            arrangements for defense of that country could be more efficient and
                            economical if the US could undertake a bigger share of its defense. The
                            British believe this could be done without the need for more US military
                            resources in the area. This adjustment would permit considerable
                            economies for the British in Cyprus, without reducing the defense
                            capability the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is providing in
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Arabian Sea-Persian Gulf area, the British believe the
                            base at Aden is one of the areas from which they must withdraw. This
                            would be compensated for by an increase in the forces in the Persian
                            Gulf area. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> plans to modify its
                            commitment to Kuwait. With the new ruler in Kuwait, it is not certain
                            how long <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> protection will be wanted.
                            With the changes proposed in the Persian Gulf the British feel they can
                            reassure the Shah that they are not letting him down. It is proposed
                            that Aden should become independent by 1968, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would then withdraw from the base there.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> very much desires that Nasser not
                            represent this as a triumph for himself, and would hope that Nasser
                            would withdraw from the Yemen, thus promoting peace and order in
                            Southwest Arabia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName>
                            suggested that the US use its influence with Nasser to encourage him to
                            refrain from making difficulties for the British in connection with
                            their withdrawal from Aden.</p>
                        <p>Turning finally to the large Indian Ocean-Pacific area, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> referred to the British paper on
                            this subject. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believes it
                            important to continue a large and indeed expensive military program in
                            that region. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> recognizes that the
                            US feels it should not have to operate alone over this area. At present,
                            only the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, and New Zealand
                            are available to join the US in this task. The British wish to make very
                            clear that they are anxious to play a full and effective part in
                            interdependent security arrangements in this area. Much depends on what
                            happens on confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia. The British
                            assume it will be over by 1970 or sooner and do not consider this
                            assessment overly optimistic. Here again, US diplomatic <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0556"/>help in easing relations between
                            Indonesia and her neighbors would be important.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said the above is
                            essentially how the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> sees the problem.
                            He said the Secretary of State for Defense would next discuss the
                            proposed British force structure. Thereafter he suggested that we
                            discuss the financial problem, the Libya and Middle East problems and
                            the Far East-Indian Ocean area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said he regretted that
                            he had not been able to provide more details earlier on the provisional
                            conclusions of the British Defense Review; he pointed out that the
                            British Defense and Overseas Policy Committee had not finished their
                            consideration of the problem until the preceding Sunday. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we are entirely familiar with
                            problems of this kind.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said he was grateful to Mr. McNamara for all the
                            assistance Mr. McNamara had rendered to him in doing his job as Minister
                            of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> pointed out that the
                            British Government is concerned over the budget and fiscal strain
                            created by their defense expenditures. The target given to him for the
                            year 1969-1970 was 2 billion pounds. This meant a savings of 400 million
                            pounds or a cut of 16% below previously projected levels. He was also
                            given a target of 100 million pounds annual savings in foreign exchange
                            costs or a cut of 1/3 in foreign exchange expenditures. These targets
                            complicated the problem he already had, which was a force structure
                            badly overstretched by covering too many commitments. He described the
                            British forces as a “stage army” trying to cover
                            100 commitments with forces enough for 10, and said this stage army had
                            become so threadbare that now there were not enough men to
                            “walk behind the stage” fast enough to keep up the
                            facade of strength.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> noted that the British
                            give the US military services their monthly deployment maps. Referring
                            to the map, he commented that British forces were deployed in
                            “penny packets” all over the world, doing jobs
                            vital to peace and security. He pointed out that British action in East
                            Africa in 1964 may have prevented another Congo type situation there;
                            similarly, operations in Zambia now are of vital importance, and British
                            reinforcements in Cyprus two years ago Christmas nipped serious trouble
                            in the bud. The two British battalions in British Guiana have made a
                            real contribution to stability in that part of the Western Hemisphere.
                            These jobs were costly for the British but they would be much more
                            costly for others. The problem the British face is whether they can
                            continue to carry out all these obligations in addition to maintaining
                            large forces in the Malaysia area. He pointed out that until quite
                            recently the British had a relatively higher percentage of their forces
                            deployed in the Far East than the US did. He indicated that the British
                            see many other potential commitments-Nigeria, for example.</p>
                        <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0557"/>
                        <p>From his viewpoint as Minister of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> considered that this scattering
                            of forces in penny packets all over the world (the stage army) had had
                            two disagreeable consequences: (1) People in the military forces are
                            badly overworked, and recruitment is becoming a problem; and (2) all
                            British troops are continuously committed to operational tasks, limiting
                            the UK's military and political flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said by August last
                            year the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had identified savings of 220
                            million pounds out of the 400 million pound target. However, these
                            budgetary savings, which involved getting better value for money, were
                            made at costs in foreign exchange, specifically by buying US aircraft.
                            Also these savings had no effect on the over-stretched condition of the
                            British forces. Since August he has had to look at the possibility of
                            reducing military tasks and the commitments from which these tasks
                            flow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then described the
                            review process he had followed. The British, using the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> techniques, had developed
                            functional costings of various commitments. There were many difficulties
                            involved since the cost of commitments change and it is a problem to
                            forecast future military tasks. The British Chiefs of Staff in 1962
                            making its forecasts did not foresee the requirement to send troops to
                            Cyprus nor did the current Defense Review take into account African
                            needs which may eventuate. He noted for example that after the illegal
                            Smith regime has collapsed, there may be a requirement for two brigades
                            in Rhodesia for a long period of time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> observed that he had had to make savings of an
                            additional 180 million pounds to meet his target ceiling of 2000 million
                            pounds. This could be accomplished partly by cutting out marginal
                            military capabilities and partly by cutting out military tasks. These
                            cuts were costed at about 130 million pounds which still leaves him 50
                            million pounds over his target.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> commented he had been
                            looking at a global force structure appropriate for tasks the British
                            should be ready to carry out. This force structure should not be
                            overstretched and should have some margin for unforeseen contingencies.
                            This new proposed structure had been costed out at 2,100 million pounds.
                            Subsequently, he had been able to narrow the gap down to 50 million
                            pounds since it was clear the Chancellor would not accept a 2,100
                            million pound defense program. A range of alternatives had been
                            identified for effecting the remaining savings, that could be offered to
                            the Cabinet for consideration. A mix of these would close the 50 million
                            pound gap, but he is anxious not to get tied down yet to a particular
                            and rigid way of closing the gap. He is hopeful that the Chancellor will
                            permit him some leeway on this remaining 50 million pounds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> emphasized that the
                            Cabinet as a whole had not yet been informed about the provisional
                            conclusions of the Defense Review. <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0558"/>There will be a need to persuade the Cabinet on the new
                            force structure and deployments, and particularly on the balance of
                            payments aspects. He described the new proposed force structure as
                            representing minor cuts in capabilities and as providing much better
                            value for expenditures. There would be a 16% cut against the original
                            Tory 2,400 million pounds defense program. This would consist of 12%
                            savings due to cost effectiveness measures, with only a 4% cut
                            reflecting actual reductions in military capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said the biggest single
                            cut falls on the Royal Navy. The Navy will have a more cost effective
                            mix of frigates and other ships, but there will be no new aircraft
                            carriers. The Royal Navy would concentrate on East of Suez tasks, and
                            would get some sophisticated new ships (including missile ships) plus
                            atomic powered hunter killer submarines and more helicopters.</p>
                        <p>In describing the rationale for the carrier decision, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> reported the British conclusion
                            that—as with <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s—only big countries can afford
                            aircraft carriers. He said the British Navy cannot man more than four
                            carriers and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> probably cannot
                            afford more than 3; this means only 1 carrier actually on station. One
                            of the carriers now in commission is the <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>,
                            which has a complement of only 12 strike aircraft plus 7 reconnaissance
                            aircraft. It appeared to the British it was not worth the heavy 10-year
                            cost of an additional carrier to maintain a force that would be
                            represented a considerable part of the time by only this small carrier
                            (the <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>). Accordingly, the proposal for a new
                            British carrier will be cancelled. However, the British would like to
                            keep their existing carrier fleet going as long as possible, and this
                            means until 1975. He said there is grave doubt as to whether the Fleet
                            Air Arm (even with Royal Air Force help) would be able to continue
                            manning a wasting force for as long as to 1975. Mr. Healey noted that
                            the British are thinking of buying Phantoms for two of their carriers;
                            these aircraft could later be ground based when the carriers are phased
                            out. He said although the strike carriers will be out by 1975 at the
                            latest, it is planned to keep some commando carriers, plus the <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> (for early warning.)</p>
                        <p>The new force structure, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>, would produce no cut in the number of aircraft
                            or men in the Royal Air Force. He said one-third of the Air Force would
                            be devoted to transport aircraft. He commented that there would be fewer
                            combat aircraft in the British Air Force in the 1970's than
                            in the French or German Air Forces. He added that the resultant Air
                            Force would be more effective and would cost less. The most important
                            feature would be 50 F-111A's, organized in four squadrons,
                            half of which would act in the reconnaissance role. The decision to try
                            to make do with only 50 F-111A's was based on three
                            considerations: first, he frankly did not think he could get approval
                                <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0559"/>from the Cabinet for a
                            larger number; second, the major aircraft project for the British in the
                            1970's is an Anglo-French variable geometry aircraft (he said
                            sometimes called the poor man's TFX), which it was planned
                            would be the follow-on aircraft; third, the British want the </p>
                        <p>F-111A's mainly for the Indo-Pacific area, where they hope to
                            operate in stride with the Australians, who are also buying
                            F-111A's. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>
                            reiterated that the key problem is the dollar cost of the billion
                            dollars worth of airplanes being bought from the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then indicated that
                            this force structure would provide an overall capability to do nearly
                            everything the British are doing now. It would have a wide range of
                            peacekeeping capabilities, including logistic support for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operations; a capability for intervention
                            against unsophisticated enemies; greatly improved airlift capability,
                            especially by incorporating C-130's; a strong reserve in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>; and an amphibious capability East
                            of Suez. It would also incorporate a powerful conventional deterrent
                            against sophisticated nations, relying on F-111's for
                            reconnaissance and strike roles, plus submarines and missiles. He
                            stressed that the F-111A's are critical to the whole force
                            structure. Finally the force structure would include a land and sea
                            based nuclear capability ranging from air delivered bombs to 4 Polaris
                            submarines. This in general terms described the overall capability of
                            the proposed force structure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then identified the
                            limitations of this force posture. Principally, if the deterrent failed,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could not in the 1970's
                            fight a limited war against a sophisticated enemy, such as Indonesia. He
                            expressed the hope that this would not happen, and noted that it would
                            probably not happen if Indonesia stopped receiving Soviet equipment or
                            underwent a more favorable development in terms of political
                            orientation. In any event, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> did not think it would be feasible politically
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in the 1970's to
                            fight limited wars without allies. Thus, he concluded that the British
                            were not really giving up a relevant capability for the
                            1970's. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName>
                            observed that in fact it is doubtful that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has the military capability today to deal effectively
                            with an expanded conflict in Indonesia.) The ability to fight a limited
                            war alone is the big option the British are renouncing, but Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> argued that the
                            British do not really have this capability militarily now and could not
                            use it politically in the 1970's.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> noted that the second
                            significant limitation imposed by the new force structure would be the
                            lack of the capability for large, long drawn out counter-insurgency
                            operations. The British view is that unless the local population can
                            carry out the basic counter-insurgency task themselves, it does not make
                            political sense to do it for them. However, the British would have the
                            capability to provide increments of support in the sophisticated area to
                            poorer countries to assist them; he <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0560"/>cited the sending of Javelins to Zambia as an example.
                            He asserted that this ability to help poor countries in Africa or Asia
                            by providing some sophisticated support may be very valuable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said a third limitation
                            would be the inability to land troops outside the range of land-based
                            aircraft, or to evacuate troops in such a situation. This was a key
                            consideration in the carrier question. He concluded that, on balance,
                            the political requirement for this type of capability is not likely to
                            be large. Without this capability the British would now have to rely on
                            help from their Allies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> then described the
                            deployment plans for this overall capability. Although plans have been
                            made in great detail, it is impossible to know now what the actual
                            deployments will be in the 1969-1970 time frame; all sorts of things may
                            happen in the intervening years. But for planning purposes, the rough
                            picture is as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The only areas with almost no forces will be the Caribbean and the
                            South Atlantic, in each of which the British will have a frigate.</p>
                        <p>(2) In Western Europe, the British will keep the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> at its present strength provided they can get a bigger
                            financial contribution to the cost of maintaining it. They will reduce
                            the RAF elements in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> committed to
                            the nuclear role, but will increase the air units devoted to ground
                            support. They will reduce the Royal Navy elements committed to <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> (from 46 to 30 escort vessels and
                            from 26 to 13 submarines, mostly in the Mediterranean).</p>
                        <p>(3) In the Middle East-North Africa area, they will retain the existing
                            planned force in Libya, giving up re-inforcement capabilities located on
                            Cyprus, and Malta with a small exception. They will leave Aden after
                            1968, but plan to start a buildup in the Persian Gulf to replace some of
                            what is lost in the area by evacuating Aden. The buildup in the Persian
                            Gulf will be in the Bahrain and Trucial Coast areas. They will modify
                            their Kuwait commitment somewhat by not providing land forces hereafter
                            except in case of a coup.</p>
                        <p>(4) In the Indo-Pacific area, the attributable cost of the force
                            structure will be 200 million pounds (which is slightly higher than the
                            Prime Minister had envisioned). The projected cost of the Indo-Pacific
                            deployments would be about 10% of the defense budget. They would
                            maintain 7 major land units, partly for amphibious purposes and partly
                            as a contribution to the Commonwealth Brigade. There would be powerful
                            sea and air forces and a floating stockpile. The Hong Kong garrison
                            would be retained, provided some financial support could be obtained
                            from the Hong Kong government. There would be a much improved air
                            movement capability in the area. In short, the British propose to retain
                            a balanced but not wholly self-sufficient capability; this capability
                            should be able to handle 95% of the contingencies likely to arise in the
                            whole area East of Suez, and 99% of the contingencies likely to arise
                            between Suez and Cocos Island.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> continued that the
                            British would need allied help, specifically for fighting a limited war
                            against sophisticated enemies. When the British carriers are gone, the
                            British will also need help in operating outside the range of British
                            land-based aircraft. He said they would need diplomatic help, too, in
                            dealing with Cairo, Djakarta, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Australia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> stressed that there
                            were little new fixed capital expenditures provided except for 10
                            million pounds in the Persian Gulf over the next few years. This means,
                            for example, that if there should be a need for an airfield on Aldabra
                            or a base in Australia, the British would need financial help. But he
                            said the main issue is foreign exchange costs, and it is in this area
                            the British need help in the next two weeks in order to get their
                            proposed new military program through the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said again that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has an extremely serious problem
                            with the foreign exchange costs of their military expenditures. For the
                            British this foreign exchange cost is about 1% of their <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, while for the US it is about 0.4%. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> foreign exchange deficit due to
                            military expenditures is 14% of their budget, while for the US it is
                            approximately 5%.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> suggested the following
                            areas might be explored to find ways of assisting them with their
                            foreign exchange problem:</p>
                        <p>(1) Get the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to contribute more to the
                            support of British forces in Germany.</p>
                        <p>(2) Possibly get some assistance for the cost of operations in
                            Singapore.</p>
                        <p>(3) Above all, work out an offset to the F-111 buy—this is
                            critical since the F-111 is the key to the proposed overall <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense posture. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> also noted that because of the
                            carrier decision, it had not been possible to reduce the numbers of F-4s
                            needed since the RAF will now require more aircraft.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> stated he must now
                            convince the Cabinet that there is a chance to recover some of the
                            incremental dollar costs of his proposed program. To complicate matters
                            there are other dollar buys being considered, such as the Lance for the
                                <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>, and the Chinook helicopter.
                            He commented that he had not yet told his Cabinet colleagues about these
                            possible additional purchases from the US.</p>
                        <p>In concluding his presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said the package just described is what the
                            Foreign Secretary and he would like. They are prepared to make
                            adjustments to meet the views of major allies, especially the US, but
                            also Australia. Getting this package through the Cabinet and through the
                            Parliament will depend on being able to assure them that the program is
                            acceptable to Britain's allies and particularly that there
                            will be help on the foreign exchange problem. Since the Cabinet has not
                            yet been told any of this (only a committee of the Cabinet has been
                            informed), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> emphasized
                            that it is vital to retain secrecy <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0562"/>until publication of the White Paper. If any of this,
                            especially anything on the weapons side and above all on the carriers,
                            was leaked here in Washington, the whole program would be gravely
                            prejudiced in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> for his presentation and said
                            the US delegation fully realizes that these views have not been approved
                            by the British Cabinet as a whole. He said he expected his colleagues to
                            keep these matters very secret until the British make them public. He
                            proposed that we continue to be in touch with the British as the Review
                            progresses.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that he found
                            himself in general agreement with most of what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> had said. The US is not opposed
                            to change as such; he pointed out that we are working very hard in this
                            Hemisphere to introduce change at a revolutionary pace. The problem is
                            whether the political fabric in these countries will permit change to be
                            accomplished by peaceful and democratic means. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued that the US would be
                            reluctant to expand its undertakings to support other nations. We have
                            formal commitments with 42 countries, and there would be great
                            reluctance to extend our commitments. The commitments to these 42
                            countries are major undertakings aimed at threats to world peace,
                            largely the problem of Communist aggression. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the US understands the British
                            problem of being overstretched. We have a comparable problem; our Great
                            Society programs are being set back this year by the costs of Vietnam.
                            Over the next 18 months, we will probably have to add $25 billion to the
                            budget to pay for Vietnam. We also have a foreign exchange problem,
                            which because of its cumulative nature is very serious for us. The
                            notion of cutting the coat to fit the cloth is one we appreciate, but if
                            everyone does this the US would have a residual responsibility involving
                            manpower, arms and finances and we simply cannot do this on a world-wide
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that the US
                            attaches the greatest importance to Britain's retaining a
                            world power role. It would be disastrous if the American people were to
                            get the impression that the US is entirely alone; they simply will not
                            accept it. There are great strains now on this point and insistent
                            questions are being asked by the American people as to what our allies
                            are doing while we are in Vietnam. There will be more questions here
                            concerning our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. The
                            American people want to know not only what they are doing for their own
                            defense, but what they are doing in other parts of the world. The US has
                            met its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitment but is also
                            involved in a major conflict in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that Britain as a
                            partner is very important to the United States in sustaining the kind of
                            role we think is essential to <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0563"/>achieve peace and security. The British world role has, in a sense, a
                            multiplier effect because of its influence on other nations. He
                            commented that he had spent most of the week before Congressional
                            committees, and there had been intensive questions on these matters. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued that in many
                            parts of the world, the British have ties as a result of which they can
                            act; they are acceptable, but the US would not be. This is partly
                            because of British historical ties in these areas and partly because the
                            US is looked on in many places as the point of the spear of the Cold
                            War.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he had the general
                            impression that we could narrow our differences rather quickly. In
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we can agree to the British
                            treating the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> as a source of
                            reinforcement for other areas, and certainly can agree with the decision
                            to make no change now in the <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>
                            itself. We can see the point in making some reductions in the Royal Air
                            Force on the Continent, but note that this will require careful handling
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to avoid undesirable political
                            repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Middle East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted we would want to talk about Libya in more
                            detail. On Aden and the Persian Gulf, he thought we could reach a common
                            understanding, and said we would see what we could do in influencing
                            Nasser. He observed that Nasser had not been the chief offender
                            recently; the Yemenis themselves had been difficult. Although Nasser has
                            not yet been tested, we will follow this closely and be prepared to
                            discuss it further.</p>
                        <p>The thing that impressed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            the most was the British statement on keeping a big and expensive force
                            in the Far East and playing a major role there. He pointed out that
                            timing of deployments is of the utmost importance in that area. We have
                            said ourselves that there is no requirement for US bases on mainland
                            Southeast Asia once peace is achieved; but if either Hanoi or Peiping
                            got the impression that the British were on the way out in the Far East,
                            it would make the British problem and our own much more difficult. (He
                            remarked that we have done about everything in our peace effort except
                            to parachute the Secretary of State into Hanoi, but we have had no
                            response.) One could understand that Hanoi might get the impression that
                            demonstrations in the US regarding Vietnam mean that the US is becoming
                            tired and will weary of the struggle. He concluded that acoustics are
                            very important in regard to the Southeast Asia situation. He considered
                            it essential to underline the fact that the American people simply will
                            not become the gendarmes of the universe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> said the same was true in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> continued that he would not want the word to get
                            out that the British are trying to get the US to take over some
                            commitments the British are dropping. This is the worst possible moment
                            in post World War II history for such a transaction. It was simply not
                            on for us to consider seriously any additional commitments. <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0564"/>He concluded that, in looking over the
                            British paper, if we could reach agreement on the detailed points then
                            we would find we are agreed in principle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was very
                            sympathetic with the British need for assistance on budget and foreign
                            exchange costs, and said the US would do everything possible to be of
                            assistance. He was impressed with the imagination displayed in
                            developing the extraordinarily ingenious solution to the British defense
                            problem. He could not over-emphasize Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s point concerning the political
                            difficulties the US would have in policing the world alone. There was,
                            in fact, a serious question in his mind as to whether the US was
                            militarily capable of doing the world-wide job. He was certain it was
                            politically impossible for the US to do it. It was not that it was a
                            financial problem for the US, for even after adding $25 billion for
                            Vietnam our defense expenditures will be a smaller percentage of our GNP
                            than in five of the past six years. Thus, it was not a financial
                            problem, but a political problem. Mr. McNamara observed there are twice
                            as many Americans in uniform proportionately as in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, including the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            He said with 270,000 men in combat, the US won't tolerate
                            indefinitely carrying this burden and will need the association of other
                            nations. He doubted whether the US could carry on for very long in the
                            Indo-Pacific area without the participation of Japan. While we must have
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participation, that will not be
                            enough. He voiced the doubt that there would be continued public support
                            for US participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> unless
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations support us elsewhere
                            in the world, over a reasonable period of time. He suggested we should
                            talk about this problem today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued that the F-111 and attendant foreign
                            exchange implications were very complex. He emphasized that the US
                            Congress is not at all willing to extend commitments anywhere while we
                            have 270,000 men in Vietnam. He concluded that we have problems of our
                            own, but he again expressed admiration for the British analysis and
                            proposed solution.<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4">Further discussion took

                                Defense Minister Healey would visit Washington to discuss the

                            U.K. will be in the black—that our military dealings with the
                            British will be on a better than 100% offset basis.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">On average over the next twelve years, with a

                            interest. I have heard from Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> of the very important agreements which he and
                            Denis Healey have worked out on some parts of this field,<note n="3" xml:id="d257fn3">No record of their meeting was found. In a February

                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> commented
                                on the U.K. decision to buy F-111 aircraft: “This
                                decision, in my view, is a major one helping to lock the British
                                into a meaningful role East of Suez.” (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Vol. 8)</note> and have asked my people to think
                            very carefully about the subject of aircraft procurement. I can tell
                            you, without any staff study, that we are very glad of your decision not
                            to sell that particular airplane to China right now.</p>

                            shows how helpful it is to keep in touch with each other on all these

                        <p>I think I ought to tell you that I have decided to advise the Queen to
                            dissolve Parliament and to hold an immediate general election. This is
                            being announced tomorrow (Monday) just after mid day your time, and the
                            election will take place on March 31.</p>
                        <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>I do not need to worry you with all the reasons why I have reached this
                            conclusion. As a more accomplished politician you may possibly have
                            reached the same conclusion before I did. But although we have managed
                            to do everything that we tried to do with our majority—the
                            smallest majority in British Parliamentary history—I think we
                            are moving into a period where the things we are going to want to do may
                            be more difficult. We want to toughen up and speed the measures needed
                            to strengthen our economy and this will mean some pretty tough
                            confrontations with various vested interests.</p>
                        <p>These confrontations will be easier if we can get a more substantial
                            mandate and if there is not expectation of an early election. I
                            don't know whether you are fortunate or unfortunate in having
                            a fixed election date. In our case the so-called freedom a Prime
                            Minister has is somewhat limited. If I do not do it now, the whole of
                            the spring and late summer, because of holidays and other reasons, will
                            be closed to me and I might become a prisoner of a very constricted
                            Parliamentary situation just at the moment of time when we want to put
                            on the legislative heat. Moreover, I am, of course, at the mercy of the
                            Almighty in respect of the deaths of sick M.P.s. So far he has been
                            extremely merciful but should he become more unselective in his choice
                            of legislative advisers, I might be left with a long period with no
                            majority at all when I want it most.</p>
                        <p>I am not proposing to ask you to come and help us during the election.
                            There are, of course, abundant precedents. Eisenhower in 1955 agreed to
                            Eden's request for an early Summit meeting to which in fact
                            Eisenhower was strongly opposed. In 1959 he conferred the same electoral
                            benefit on Macmillan and indeed allowed himself to be toted through 14
                            London marginal constituencies in an open car with Macmillan beside him.
                            I have no such requests except that if you were thinking of doing
                            anything which might be positively unhelpful, I hope that you would at
                            any rate give me a little notice.</p>
                        <p>Heath is now attacking our defence review on the grounds that it drives
                            us too closely into relations with you. <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Douglas-Home</persName> in a presumably ghosted article in
                            today's <hi rend="italic">Sunday Express</hi> listing the
                            election issues, calls on the electors to vote Conservative so that we
                            do not accept satellite status to the United States. I have no doubt
                            that this will be one of their themes and that they will make an appeal
                            to the latent anti-Americanism amongst some of our electorate which they
                            called into being with some success at the time of Suez. If I took this
                            particular threat seriously, I might suggest to you that we should have
                            a row in order to help me, but quite honestly I cannot think of anything
                            to have a row about. Should you think of a suitable subject you will no
                            doubt let me know.</p>
                        <p>It may be that during the next four weeks difficulties may arise and as I
                            am very anxious to safeguard our future relations not only bilaterally
                                <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0568"/>but within the Alliance
                            generally, you may find me getting in touch with you. If I get too
                            hysterical you will no doubt dismiss it as the election fever. Quite
                            honestly you may find me, if driven, taking a slightly anti-German line.
                            If I have to employ xenophobia, which I hope will not be necessary, I
                            would rather it be of that variety than the Tory anti-Americanism, and
                            the Germans have been warned that this is possible since they quite
                            unscrupulously attacked me in their last election as a means of
                            discrediting the S.P.D. I did not react at the time because I know what
                            politicians are like during elections, though I made it clear to them
                            that I reserved the same right when the time came. But I would hope it
                            would not go too far.</p>
                        <p>The other big issue relates to sterling. Election speculation has led to
                            a little weakness in the last week or two because elections mean
                            instability and also because there has been some fear that if the
                            Conservatives got in they would do what we did not do and devalue
                            sterling on the day they took office blaming it on their predecessors.
                            But now the expectation of a Conservative victory is quite small. The
                            polls give us an all-time high in our lead and the betting odds are 6-1
                            on Labour, 7-2 against Tories. I am not, however, as complacent as this
                            since an expectation of easy victory leads some times to people not
                            bothering to vote. After all there is 1948 in your country as a warning
                            to me.</p>
                        <p>So far as sterling is concerned I am convinced an early election is
                            essential. If we do not go now we shall have a continual period of
                            electioneering through the spring, summer and autumn which could have a
                            more serious effect on sterling. Moreover my colleagues and I feel that
                            we may need tougher measures and these would be easier in a
                            post-election rather than pre-election situation, though we do not
                            intend during the election to disguise from the electors the seriousness
                            of the situation and what measures we may have to take.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to trouble you with all these arguments about our internal
                            situation and I am addressing them to you less in your capacity as head
                            of government than in your other capacity as a full-time student of
                            political affairs. But during the next month we may need to be in touch
                            with you should the election situation create difficulties which may
                            have more prolonged effects either bilaterally or in the wider field of
                            international affairs.</p>

                        <p>Begin text: I shall be sending you tomorrow a full account of my
                            discussions with Erhard,<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">On May 26 <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> sent the President a 3-page

                            are in complete agreement on the whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> situation. With reference to your message of last
                            Saturday, nuclear sharing was not mentioned by either of us though it
                            was raised in the discussion between the Foreign Secretaries.</p>
                        <p>My immediate purpose, however, in sending this message relates to the
                            visit I had from <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName>
                            yesterday, that is to say Monday. He told me of your present intentions
                            in connection with oil installations at Hanoi and Hi Phong, while
                            explaining that no final decision had been taken.</p>
                        <p>As I am sure you know, we have always made clear that any bombing of
                            either of these cities would create a situation where we would have to
                            dissociate ourselves from the action taken. This was, you will remember,
                            fully explained at our meeting in December<note n="4" xml:id="d259fn4">See <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note> and, as I think
                            your Embassy has reported to you, I have said this more than once when
                            under pressure in the House of Commons. You will therefore understand
                            that I shall have to make a statement of this kind if this action takes
                            place, though you will realise equally that this will not affect my
                            general support of American policy in Vietnam, except in this particular
                            aspect of its execution.</p>
                        <p>Knowing as I well do the tremendous problems with which you are faced and
                            recognising the tremendous pressures in which you are situated, I would
                            nevertheless ask you to reconsider whether this action, whatever its
                            results in terms of immediate military advantage, is worth the candle.
                            The decision will be yours, and I know you understand our difficulties
                            and the nature of the statement we would have to make. It will make no
                            difference to our basic position, but I would <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0570"/>not want there to be any possible
                            danger that you would take this action in possible ignorance of what our
                            reaction would have to be. End text.</p>

                        <p>Begin text: It was really good and strengthening to know that your
                            meeting with Erhard went well.</p>
                        <p>I understand the political strains on your side in making this
                            relationship solid, as well as the financial issues which you as well as
                            we have to face with the Germans. On the other hand, as you clearly
                            perceive and express, right now—and far into the
                            future—the three of us must lean in and stay together.</p>
                        <p>Our next test—and it is clearly critical—is
                            Brussels. But we have every reason to go into it in reasonably good
                            heart.</p>
                        <p>On some of the longer range issues raised in your letter, I am awaiting
                            the completion of staff work before putting to you some constructive
                            possibilities. I am determined that, if at all possible, we shall
                            accompany the difficult defensive moves we have to make with evidence
                            that the Fourteen, at least, can move forward on many fronts.</p>
                        <p>Let me say that I was very pleased to hear that you and Erhard had a good

                        <p>I am coming to believe it is essential that we reduce their oil supply in
                            the light of the radical increase in the flow of men and
                            matériel by truck to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>For me the calculus is, simply, whether they shall have less oil or I
                            shall have more casualties.</p>
                        <p>But I am determined that their civilian casualties be low and

                        <p>The Secretary said President Johnson sent his warm regards and his
                            appreciation for the way in which <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> has kept in close touch with us on questions in
                            Southeast Asia. There was one specific problem he wished to raise and
                            that was the question of how Britain sees its relationship to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. As Confrontation ends and the
                            British move to bring substantial forces back from Southeast Asia, this
                            question becomes significant. He recognized the special political
                            problems assistance in Vietnam raised for Britain but wondered whether
                            these were applicable in the case of Thailand. The Thais have been
                            pressing us for <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0572"/>U.S. manned
                            helicopters and this is a need which the U.K. might fill, one relatively
                            small in scale.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said this involved deep domestic problems. Last year,
                            he got away pretty well with a tough line on Vietnam but the situation
                            was now changing. The Vietnamese lobby was no longer standing alone and
                            a big fight was brewing not only with the pacificists but with the
                            sophisticated Europeanists. The East of Suez policy was coming under
                            heavy attack and a much more dangerous line-up against the British
                            policy was coming about. Both factions were afraid of Britain getting
                            dug in in Southeast Asia in a policy of containment of China. If these
                            suspicions were to be fed by the extension of small aid of the type the
                            Secretary had suggested in Thailand, the result would be a strengthening
                            of the anti-Vietnam forces in Britain which are now showing more and
                            more overtones of anti-Americanism.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> noted that the
                            U.K. is now giving a good deal of help, such as in training Vietnamese
                            in Malaysia and in airfield construction in North Thailand. This could
                            be jeopardized if the British gratuitously added to their burdens by
                            expanding assistance in Thailand. He noted also that the British were in
                            particularly short supply of helicopters and helicopter crews. They have
                            had to rob their European inventory seriously and there are only 9 left
                            in Europe. While there are many helicopters in Southeast Asia, they are
                            still over-extended in the area. This was the last type of assistance
                            which the British would be able to handle.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary returned to the question of how to interpret our
                            obligations under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. The
                                treaty<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">Reference is to the Southeast
                                Asia Collective Defense Treaty, signed at Manila on September 8,
                                1954, which established <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. (6
                                    <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 81)</note> could be
                            liquidated under conditions of peace, but these conditions did not
                            exist. The fact is there is a treaty and the question is how does the
                            U.K. interpret its obligations under it. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> interjected that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> involved no commitment to help the
                            Thais with internal security problems. The Secretary wondered whether it
                            could be extended under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            contingency planning. The Prime Minister said that anything which
                            appeared to be “reactivating” <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would create problems. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> observed that the very
                            thing which the United States is trying to obtain, namely a commitment
                            of U.K. power further north, was just the thing which would make the
                            moves suggested most difficult to sell. New physical steps of this
                            character would look to many like the U.K. was beginning along the same
                            path that the U.S. took in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that there were two different views of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment. The French and
                            Pakistanis have taken one view. <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0573"/>The U.S., the Thais, the Filipinos and others have taken another.
                            Where does the U.K. stand? The Prime Minister said that the only way the
                            U.K. could make its commitments in Singapore credible was to terminate
                            confrontation. Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> noted that the U.K. was planning now to bring
                            home only those “Confrontation reinforcements”
                            sent out after 1963. If everything were to go perfectly in ending
                            Confrontation, the U.K. could start withdrawals to Malaysia, Singapore
                            and Hong Kong beginning next year. Thereafter, they could start
                            redeploying forces as, for example, returning borrowed troops to the
                                <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>. At most, their forces in the
                            area would go down to 3/4 of the maximum confrontation force. It was
                            still not clear, however, that things would go perfectly on ending
                            Confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister noted that it was not only the pacifists and
                            Europeanists who opposed the East of Suez policy, but the economists,
                            who felt that more foreign exchange was seeping away than was justified
                            by British interest in the area. Nevertheless, the U.K. would give
                            “prayerful consideration” to the
                            Secretary's words, but the problems could not be overstated.
                            Last year, the Vietnam policy opponents were pressing for a cessation of
                            bombing. Now they were pressing for U.S. withdrawal. He asked how the
                            U.S. felt about the situation in Vietnam at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on the military side, some of the Viet Cong
                            battalions had come out in the open in the last few days. When they come
                            out in the open, they cannot stand up. The U.S. now has enormous
                            firepower on the ground. By mid-summer, there will be more than was
                            expended in any month of World War II. The problem was, however, in
                            fighting an enemy you could not find. On the political side, the impasse
                            continued. As he had told the Norwegians, they could tell their critics
                            that if they could produce Hanoi, Norway could produce the U.S.
                            Secretary of State. It was necessary to remember, however, that Hanoi
                            had never said that a willingness to negotiate with the Viet Cong would
                            solve anything. There was no reason to believe that Hanoi had any change
                            in policy since the bombing pause, which had lasted twice as long as
                            even the Soviets had suggested without producing a single result.
                            Nevertheless, we are interested in getting some political process
                            underway. That is why we believe we should try to make something out of
                            Sihanouk's request to get the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> going. He had urged the Russians to respond to this
                            request. If the two co-chairmen could meet in Geneva, or the three
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> countries could get together, we
                            would have something going for us. He had even scraped the bottom of the
                            barrel and considered whether as many of us who would, could just go to
                            Geneva and issue a standing invitation to do business, leaving empty
                            chairs for the rest. However, the U.S. just cannot give up in Vietnam.
                            What is at stake is the value of our word and this is more important <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0574"/>than 14 million South
                            Vietnamese or even all of Southeast Asia in the present context.</p>

                        <p>He was absolutely confident he would and could avoid any embarrassment to
                            the President during his visit Washington.</p>
                        <p>He asked me to emphasize to you following points:</p>
                        <p>1. He is a politician, and, as such, highly sensitive to other
                            statesmen's concerns. He has never yet in his visits to the
                            President embarrassed him, and would on no account do so.</p>
                        <p>2. If questioned by any one, publicly or privately, on his

                            subject are on public record, and can be read in Hansard. He sees no
                            reason to repeat or explain them.</p>
                        <p>3. He would like President to rest assured that “he does not
                            believe in making a mess on another fellow's
                            carpet.”</p>
                        <p>4. The showdown with his own party will soon be over, and though it will
                            be a violent episode, he has no doubt of winning.</p>
                        <p>5. He would like to come to Washington on July 29. He would particularly

                        <p>—Last week's severe losses—$200 million
                            on Friday alone—followed a month of weakness. If they do not
                            take severe measures, they very likely will face an avalanche by the end
                            of next week. (The U.K. reserve position is set forth at Tab A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">None of the tabs is printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—As you know, on the telephone on Friday, Callaghan promised a
                            powerful package of demand-compression and wage restraint, to be
                            announced Wednesday.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">On July 21 the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> government
                                presented 500 million pounds in budgetary cuts to Parliament.</note>
                            He was confident that <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> would
                            be backed by a united Cabinet. According to Callaghan, the only
                            seriously divisive issue involved cuts in overseas spending, i.e.,
                            defense and aid. De-valuation, <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0576"/>he said, is out. (A record of my telephone conversation with the
                            Chancellor is at Tab B.)</p>
                        <p>—Even if the Wednesday measures scare away the
                            bears—and certainly if they do not—we will face
                            some critical choices. This memorandum is to report the views of your
                            advisors about these choices. It is based on extended discussion on
                            Saturday morning between myself, Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_AHG1">Ackley</persName>, Rostow, Barr, <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName>, and Okun.</p>
                        <p>There are basically two possibilities:</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The U.K. actions on Wednesday are successful in
                                keeping the bears at bay and bringing U.K. payments into balance
                                during the next few months</hi>.</p>
                        <p>(1) This outcome is quite possible. Callaghan sounded both determined and
                            appropriately scared. The New York Fed's foreign exchange
                            expert, Charlie Coombs, is convinced that a strong package would lead to
                            substantial reflow of money into London—much like last
                            September. In any case, we will know, one way or the other, fairly
                            quickly.</p>
                        <p>(2) But no matter how successful the program is in stopping the
                            speculators, and eliminating the deficit, it cannot be a permanent cure.
                            It will “solve” the U.K. payments problem, but at
                            the cost of recession now, and, over the longer pull, unacceptable
                            unemployment and little or no growth. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> will still be up against the basic problem faced
                            by every British government since the post-war recovery—how
                            to keep his international payments in order and, at the same time, keep
                            unemployment at a tolerable level and maintain a good rate of
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>(3) In the face of that prospect—and in the face of the
                            mounting political pressures on him to back away from a policy of
                            deflation (and perhaps wage freeze), <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> may decide that, in order to resolve his
                            long-term dilemma, he must:</p>
                        <p>(i) Save several hundred million dollars of foreign exchange by cutting
                            back on defense East of Suez and in Germany. (At Tab C is a table giving
                            the foreign exchange costs to the U.K. of its present defense positions
                            in Malaysia, the Persian Gulf, Germany, etc. The balance of payments
                            cost in the Far East is about $200 million per year.)</p>
                        <p>(ii) Reduce <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> spending for defense, in
                            order to make more domestic resources available for export and
                            investment—they will have a tough time meeting their defense
                            commitments without running way over their 1970 target for defense
                            spending (5-percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The present
                            budgetary costs of overseas defense, by area, are also set out at Tab C.
                            The Far East costs about $750 million per year, about 13 percent of the
                            U.K. defense budget and about 0.8 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.).</p>
                        <p>(4) Quite apart from the economics, there will be great political
                            pressure on him to reduce defense spending—especially East of
                            Suez. <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0577"/>Absent such action, he
                            will be accused of making his unemployed pay for a neo-colonial policy,
                            under pressure from Washington.</p>
                        <p>(5) This is where we come in. So far, the U.S. position has been
                            that:</p>
                        <p>—The U.K. must remain in full force in the Far East ($200
                            million in foreign exchange; $750 million in budget costs);</p>
                        <p>—They must keep the full British Army on the Rhine ($238
                            million in foreign exchange, about 50 percent offset; $504 million in
                            budget cost);</p>
                        <p>—They must get their balance of payments in order without
                            devaluation, or exchange controls, or permanent restrictions on
                            trade;</p>
                        <p>—There is no more U.S. money to bail them out in case they run
                            into trouble.</p>
                        <p>(6) It is more than likely that <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> will say that he cannot do all that without more
                            help from the U.S.—that it would involve his keeping his
                            economy in a permanent state of recession. Specifically, he might face
                            us with an implicit “more money” or
                            “cut East of Suez” choice. His tactic would be to
                            propose a cut-back in Malaysia during '67-'68, on
                            the ground that “confrontation” has ended. If so,
                            our options will be as follows:</p>
                        <p>(i) We can, after some preliminary bargaining, offer him an extra $200
                            million per year through arms sales and U.S. redeployment from the
                            Continent to the U.K. This would cover his Far East foreign exchange
                            costs. Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> believes we
                            can do this without any significant balance of payments cost to the
                            U.S., simply by shifting to the U.K. defense dollars now going to France
                            and Germany (on top of what the Germans offset). All your advisors agree
                            that this would be a worthwhile bargain. Defense and State are working
                            on a possible package.</p>
                        <p>(ii) This may not turn the trick. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> may feel that he has got to cut back in the Far
                            East even if his direct foreign exchange costs are covered. He may feel
                            that the domestic, defense-budget cost of his present Far East position
                            ($750 million, 13 percent of defense budget, .8 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) is unacceptable—that he
                            needs to free up the resources involved for investment and exports.
                            Further, he may feel that, even apart from economics, the political cost
                            is too great.</p>
                        <p>(iii) If <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> turns down a U.S.
                            offer which would cover his Far East foreign exchange costs, our choices
                            will be more painful, and your advisors are of two minds:</p>
                        <p>—Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> still
                            believes that it is absolutely essential that the U.K. remain in the Far
                            East. For the next year or two, he thinks anything which will smell of a
                            British pull out will fatally undermine our domestic base on Viet Nam.
                            Further, he believes that confrontation in Malaysia will, in fact,
                            continue indefinitely and is determined that it remain a British
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>—I, myself, believe that, if we adopt Bob's
                            position—and <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            goes along—it will either cost us a weak Britain and a great
                            deal of balance <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0578"/>of payments
                            money or, even more likely, a weak Britain and an eventual devaluation
                            of sterling. Either would have disastrous consequences for the
                            dollar—and for our international political position. I do not
                            believe that this, or any other U.K. government, will be willing to
                            sacrifice its domestic goals to maintain an overseas position in which
                            it does not believe, for the sake of a friend—unless that
                            friend is willing to pay for the favor. And I do not think we can afford
                            the price, either in terms of money now or in terms of an implied
                            open-ended call on U.S. money in case of trouble later.</p>
                        <p>My own position is that our first priority should be to move the United
                            Kingdom to save its long-term economic and financial position and
                            thereby to prevent potentially disastrous consequences for the United
                            States, our over-all foreign policy, and the stability of the Free World
                            financial system. A weak ally is of no use to us East of Suez, in
                            Europe, in the international financial set-up, or anywhere else. This
                            priority suggests that we must leave it to the U.K. government to decide
                            what it must do, short of devaluation, to save its national position. It
                            would be contrary to this priority for us to lean on the Prime Minister
                            to do something he would not otherwise do. If we do, we will pay a large
                            price many times over, and damage both the pound and the dollar. In
                            other words, I would not go beyond the terms of the $200 million package
                            suggested in the first paragraph, (i), above.</p>
                        <p>—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agrees
                            with Bob that it is important to us that Britain hold up its end in the
                            Far East. However, following his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Michael Stewart</persName> in Canberra, he is
                            skeptical whether we can keep the U.K. in a meaningful Far East role at
                            any price. He doubts whether they have it in them to stick it out. You
                            will, of course, want to hear his views—as those of
                            Bob—in person.</p>
                        <p>(7) I have assumed that the implicit choice will be:</p>
                        <p>(i) pull out from East of Suez, <hi rend="italic">or</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(ii) more money now, <hi rend="italic">or</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(iii) a progressive deterioration of sterling during 1967-68 (with
                            devaluation or more bail-out money at the end of the road).</p>
                        <p>It is possible that, as an alternative, <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> will say that they must cut either East of Suez
                            or in Germany. A sharp cut in the British Army on the Rhine will appear
                            particularly attractive to London if the Germans do not improve the U.K.
                            offset. (They are currently bargaining, with a report due to the two
                            governments in September.)</p>
                        <p>(8) On a Far East versus Germany choice, you will wish to have a separate
                            memorandum spelling out the arguments. Bob <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would clearly prefer a substantial British
                            cut-back in Europe over any reduction in the Far East. I
                            don't know Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s views on this. I suspect that a number
                            of your foreign policy advisors would vote the other way. They would be
                            worried about the strain imposed on German politics, the consequences
                            for Britain's prospects for going into Europe, and an
                            unhealthy, excessive German dependence on the United States.</p>

                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The second possibility is that the Wednesday
                                package will not do the trick</hi>.</p>
                        <p>This could happen because the package is inadequate in terms of the basic
                            deficit. I told Callaghan it would be better to be safe than sorry, but
                            his (perfectly honest) notions of strong action may be different from
                            mine. Or, although adequate in terms of the basic payments position, it
                            might not convince the world, especially the speculators. In either
                            case, sterling would remain teetering on the edge. The marginally more
                            likely prospect would be for continued erosion over several weeks, with
                            a series of bad Fridays culminating in a disastrous run during the late
                            summer or autumn. The alternative would be a really massive run within
                            the next week or two.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">In either case, we would face the same choices we faced
                                last summer</hi>:</p>
                        <p>(i) We could put up more bail money. I do not believe we could count on
                            getting help from the Europeans, and I would vote, as I did last summer,
                            against putting up a nickel on our own.</p>
                        <p>(ii) A large devaluation of sterling (e.g., 25 percent), which would be
                            followed down by everyone else.</p>
                        <p>(iii) A controlled or small devaluation, followed by only a few sterling
                            area countries and no one else. (This is the outcome we would work for,
                            but it would not be easy to convince the U.K. A small devaluation tends
                            to be unconvincing and may make the speculation worse.)</p>
                        <p>I believe our contingency plans, worked out last summer and kept updated
                            (under Fred Deming's chairmanship, by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Bator</persName>, Okun, <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Solomon</persName>, and Dewey Daane) are in good shape. I will be
                            prepared to discuss them with you on a separate occasion at your
                            convenience.</p>
                        <p>We will need a full-dress meeting with you and your other advisors during
                            the early part of this week.<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">The meeting was
                                held July 22. According to Bruce: “I made my spiel,
                                suggesting we have not only a short range but a long range policy
                                toward the British. Ball proposed, among other things, we push them
                                into the Common Market…. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> supported him. Joe Fowler thinks they are
                                over-extended in their commitments. The President listened but was
                                cryptic in his comments.” (Department of State, Bruce

                            problems because I was going straight into a full discussion with the
                            Cabinet, on the basis of the very drastic studies made to give effect to
                            my statement of last Thursday.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and I have now examined these in detail and I shall be
                            making a further statement about them in the House this afternoon. So I
                            now write to let you know how I see the basic issues and how we propose
                            to tackle them. I need not trouble you with the details. John Stevens
                            will go over these with <persName corresp="#p_BF1">Francis
                                Bator</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We all realize the basic problem that confronts us, namely that our
                            spending and our costs must be brought under control; and that this will
                            mean some real suffering for both the public and the private sectors. To
                            do the trick, the package of measures which I am announcing must
                            have—and will have—a very hard disinflationary
                            impact. In particular, we have decided on a total standstill for the
                            next six months on prices and incomes and on a further six months period
                            of very severe restraint in that field. Of course, no one in Britain
                            will like these measures, especially the wage freeze. But I am convinced
                            that public opinion here now accepts the need for drastic sacrifice and
                            that, in this mood, it will rise to the challenge.</p>
                        <p>But if we are to ask the British public to cooperate willingly over the
                            sacrifices essential to put our economy to rights, they must equally be
                            satisfied that they are not being asked to carry a disproportionate
                            share of the general cost of Western defense. We cannot, in imposing
                            these measures at home, avoid also reducing our Government expenditure
                            overseas, civil and military and including defense expenditures in
                            Germany as well as elsewhere. But I am telling Parliament that any cut
                            of this nature should not affect the basic lines of foreign policy on
                            which the defense review was founded. This means that they must be
                            consistent with our international commitments and with our common policy
                            in defense of Western interests throughout the world. I hope we <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0581"/>can discuss the problem
                            together in this spirit when we meet next week.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>When Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> comes to
                            Washington eight days from now we can follow one of two lines of
                            policy:</p>
                        <p>We can discuss his monetary measures, review additional ways and means of
                            bolstering the pound, press the British to put troops in Thailand and to
                            maintain their expense expenditures, and offer to juggle our military
                            sales arrangements to make this easier for them.</p>
                        <p>This follows the general line of short-term improvisation that has marked
                            our relations with a succession of British Governments since the end of
                            the war. It is the course of least resistance; it is what <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> expects and he will come prepared
                            for it.</p>
                        <p>The alternative is to look beyond the immediate present and to talk with
                            Wilson in some depth about the longer-range relations between our two
                            nations based on a clear understanding of the respective roles which
                            each country should play in the development of a rational world system.
                            This is a difficult and rigorous exercise. It requires that each of us
                            clearly face reality.</p>
                        <p>Britain must recognize that she is no longer the center of a world system
                            but that she can nevertheless play a critical role by applying her
                            talents and resources to the leadership of Western Europe. We, on our
                            part, should face the fact that it is basically unhealthy to encourage
                            the United Kingdom to continue as America's poor relation,
                            living beyond her means by periodic American bailouts. We must, in other
                                <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0582"/>words, redefine the
                            so-called “special relationship” in terms
                            consistent with the longer-range interests of both our nations.</p>
                        <p>This is a good moment to begin. Compelling political and financial
                            reasons combine to make it necessary and profitable for Britain to set a
                            realistic course; at the same time they provide us the leverage to help
                            bring this about. It is imperative that we use that leverage with a
                            strong and clear purpose.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that we urge on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> the following propositions:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposition One—Britain Cannot, by
                            Herself, Continue to Play a World Role.</p>
                        <p>To solve her problems Britain must adjust her national aspirations to the
                            limitations of her resources in the perspective of the present world
                            power structure.</p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom is no longer the center of an effective world system.
                            The Commonwealth has become little more than a figure of speech; it has
                            meager meaning in a power sense—and not much meaning in a
                            commercial sense. The “new” Commonwealth has no
                            collective significance; at most it is a series of bilateral
                            arrangements that are rapidly wasting away. The
                            “old” Commonwealth is gradually fading out. Prime
                            Minister Holt told me, for example, that for the first time in history
                            the Australian papers were openly questioning the value to Australia of
                            the “fiction” of allegiance to the Queen.</p>
                        <p>The problem for Britain is primarily psychological. Unlike the
                            continental European nations, it did not have the shock of defeat and
                            occupation to break it out of old molds of thought. It has not found it
                            easy to relate its own internal social revolution to the acceptance of a
                            new national role.</p>
                        <p>Here is where American influence and American policy can make the
                            critical difference. For Britain—by itself—is
                            unlikely to adjust to the facts of a new world environment quickly
                            enough to check a developing imbalance in European affairs that can be
                            dangerous for all of us. She needs the stimulus of American
                            leadership—or, in other words, the pressure of a determined
                            American policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposition Two—Britain Can Play a
                            Highly Constructive Role for Herself and the World by Moving Decisively
                            Toward Europe.</p>
                        <p>The need for British leadership of a uniting Western Europe is obvious.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has rejected that
                            leadership by pursuing an atavistic nationalism. Germany obviously
                            cannot assume it. But Britain has the prestige and ability for the
                            task.</p>
                        <p>We should impress on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> what that role of leadership implies. The British
                            effort should not be confined to checking <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0583"/>the fragmentation and renewal of national rivalries
                            toward which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>'s policies are tending. Britain should seek
                            to turn Europe outward both in its commercial policy and its political
                            interests—in other words, to lead the peoples of Western
                            Europe, moving toward unity, toward a new involvement in, and
                            responsibility for, world affairs. This is not limited to the provision
                            of political tutelage and economic aid to a restricted group of
                            developing nations—important as that may be. It means that a
                            united Western Europe should play a role along with the United States in
                            keeping the peace around the world.</p>
                        <p>Britain's other great mission in entering Europe would be to
                            restore the balance between Germany and its neighbors that has been
                            disturbed by French nationalism. A uniting Europe founded on
                            Franco-German understanding has been increased by the fact of British
                            aloofness, for a United Kingdom standing apart from Europe acts as a
                            lodestone, drawing with unequal degrees of force on the individual parts
                            of the European body corporate.</p>
                        <p>Britain within Europe, on the contrary, would provide the balance for a
                            strongly-based European structure. It would dilute the bilateralism of
                            the present Franco-German relationship which, by itself, is inherently
                            unstable. It would give Western Europe a sense of completeness that
                            should go far to assure its durability.</p>
                        <p>In this way we might tend to check the dangerous tendencies which French
                            nationalism is already producing—tendencies which if
                            continued could lead to the unhealthy situation of a disaffected Germany
                            bound to the West by an increasingly irksome bilateral relationship with
                            the United States and threatened with permanent discrimination by her
                            neighbors on both sides.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> is likely to reply to these
                            contentions that France is still threatening to interpose its veto to
                            British accession to the Rome Treaty, and that, in any event, Britain
                            cannot join Europe until it has negotiated adjustments in the Treaty

                            agriculture, etc.</p>
                        <p>The answer is that Britain's tactics are placing it at a
                            hopeless disadvantage against French obstructionism.</p>
                        <p>The French Government has said that if Britain were prepared to join the
                            Treaty as written it could do so immediately. Britain, as an applicant,
                            has little bargaining power; Britain, as a member, would be in strong
                            position to work out the requisite adjustments since, on each issue, it
                            could make common cause with one or more combinations of other Community
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, Britain were to make clear its willingness to sign the
                            Treaty, France would be hard-put to find a basis for objection.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s likely
                            rejoinder is that the British public is not ready for a decisive move
                            toward Europe at this time. But a recent Gallup Poll has shown that 70%
                            of the people favor entry into the Common Market if the British
                            Government thinks it wise (as compared with 28% in 1963 at the time of
                            the French veto). Moreover, the Labour Party would, in effect, be
                            stealing the Tories' clothes, since Heath has already
                            indicated he would pursue this course if the Conservatives came to
                            power.</p>

                        <p>The final aspect of a rational United States policy toward Britain
                            concerns nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Labour Party ran for office in 1964 on the promise that it would give
                            up its nuclear deterrent. We should urge Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> to live up to that promise.
                            Britain definitely cannot afford the resources and foreign exchange that
                            go into the construction of the present four nuclear submarines. It
                            gains little in world prestige by being a nuclear power but it could
                            gain great respect from the world by taking the statesmanlike step of
                            getting out of the business.</p>
                        <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0585"/>
                        <p>There is reason to think that <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> may hope some day to trade off cooperation in
                            nuclear weapons matters with the French as the price of entry into the
                            Common Market. This is, however, an illusion we should discourage. So
                            long as De Gaulle rules, the French will have no interest in sharing any
                            part of the control of the bomb with any other country, and it is
                            certainly not in our interest to promote Anglo-French nuclear
                            cooperation that is designed to perpetuate two national nuclear systems.
                            Moreover, a considerable part of British nuclear technology has been
                            provided by the United States and Britain has no right to give it away.
                            We should make this clear to <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>By giving up her national nuclear deterrent Britain could strike a
                            dramatically effective blow against the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> Government is pressing
                            hard for a treaty with the Soviet Union in order to stop other nations
                            from obtaining nuclear weapons. But British activities in this direction
                            are likely to do more harm than good, since it is unedifying for a
                            nation of fifty million people to insist that it must maintain a
                            national deterrent, while contending that India with its 350,000,000
                            peoples and Japan with its 100,000,000 should accept self-denying
                            ordinances. The British position is particularly galling to its former
                            colonial dependency, India, since it gives a colonialist cast to the
                            whole non-proliferation effort.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of the United Kingdom national deterrent has a considerable
                            effect on Indian and Japanese nuclear appetites. By contrast, an evident
                            United Kingdom determination to abandon the national deterrent could
                            make it easier for these countries to remain non-nuclear.</p>
                        <p>Britain's abandonment of its national nuclear deterrent would
                            bring a second important result in greatly easing the problem of nuclear
                            sharing, particularly for Germany. If Britain feels that she cannot give
                            up her nuclear deterrent to any collective arrangement in which the
                            Germans might participate then the alternative is for it to get out of
                            the business altogether.</p>
                        <p>This act in itself would make the German problem manageable. Given the
                            status of Britain in German psychology, parity with the United Kingdom
                            would be a full answer to the anxiety over nuclear discrimination.</p>

                        <p>Some thought is being given to such a proposal in the British Foreign
                            Office. Whether or not the United Kingdom succeeds in joining the Common
                            Market a British proposal for a European Defense

                        <p>Almost certainly this proposal would be turned down by France. Yet it
                            would still have powerful appeal to the other Five and they might <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0586"/>be prepared to move forward in
                            this sector without France. The creation of such a Community would

                            disposition of the United Kingdom nuclear deterrent, the future

                            “special relationship” with Britain, but have
                            received only limited benefits in return. The relationship does,
                            however, provide leverage by which we can encourage the steps spelled
                            out in this paper—provided we are willing to use it
                            firmly.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, our principal elements of leverage are the following:</p>

                                Role</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I would not recommend that we ask Britain to reduce her present East of
                            Suez commitments. I do recommend, however, that we not press her hard to
                            maintain them in anything like their present dimensions.</p>
                        <p>As the Wednesday announcement made clear, Britain does not propose to
                            maintain her overseas commitments at current levels. The basic reason
                            for this is political. Britain cannot ask the British people to
                            sacrifice wages and profits while still paying for a world role which,
                            they tend to feel, is more nostalgic than real. Thus—no
                            matter what we may say about it—Britain will inevitably cut
                            down her overseas deployments as confrontation terminates, although in
                            any event the United Kingdom presence East of Suez will continue for a
                            while. To the extent that she delays the process of reducing that
                            presence as the result of American pressure, we will have to pay an
                            exorbitant price—both financial and political. And the
                            probabilities are, that whatever we pay we will not materially affect
                            Britain's inevitable withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>It is a mistake to view the problem purely in money terms.
                            Britain's present deployments East of Suez are costing her
                            $263 million of foreign exchange; equally as important, they are
                            consuming $924 million of budgetary resources which affect
                            Britain's ability to produce for export. In addition, there
                            are 100,000 men East of Suez at a time when Britain is suffering an
                            acute labor shortage at home that affects its ability to produce goods
                            for export.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we can juggle our military assistance arrangements at
                            different points in the world so as to help meet part of these
                            balance-of-payments costs. But this would settle nothing in the long
                            term; for the problem is political, not financial. Whether it be logical
                            or not, Britain will not easily adjust to a role of European leadership
                            so long as she continues to extend herself in order to maintain a shadow
                            of her Nineteenth Century imperial position. Certainly, that is the way
                            it will seem to the British people as well as the Continental
                            Europeans.</p>
                        <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0587"/>
                        <p>In my view, we should, therefore, relax our pressure on Britain to do
                            things that she will either refuse to do or will do only at substantial
                            financial cost to us and at the expense of deflecting her attention from
                            necessary and constructive decisions.</p>
                        <p>We should have no illusions as to the outcome. When the chips are
                            down,</p>
                        <p>—Britain will not put troops into Thailand;</p>
                        <p>—She will maintain Singapore only a few years longer;</p>
                        <p>—She will fall back on Australia and bring her troops home
                            once confrontation is ended.</p>
                        <p>This should, however, not make us too unhappy. It is a mistake to regard
                            the size of the British Far Eastern presence as significantly relevant
                            to the American commitment in that part of the world. The American
                            people have not conditioned their attitude toward our participation in
                            the Vietnamese war on the continued maintenance of 55,000 British troops
                            in Malaysia. Very few of them, in fact, know about it. If Britain were
                            to pull her men home I think it would have a miniscule effect on the
                            American determination to stay the course.</p>
                        <p>In our current discussions the question of British overseas deployments
                            has been posed as a matter of choice. Would we rather have Britain
                            remove troops from Germany or diminish its East of Suez role?</p>
                        <p>In terms of the propositions I have put forward in this memorandum, the
                            answer is clear. British troops in Germany have an immediate relevance
                            to Britain's participation in Europe. British troops in the
                            Far East are a distraction from the role that Britain should play over
                            the next few years.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that we not use our muscle in an effort to keep a
                            large British presence East of Suez, since we should not seek to
                            perpetuate a transient advantage at the expense of a long-term policy.
                            By permitting Britain to phase out her Asian deployments we can help her
                            make the hard decision to give up the pretensions to a world role that
                            are today diverting her from a more constructive purpose.</p>

                            other Community countries should not be asked to undertake the Rome
                            Treaty obligations to provide mutual help to a Britain running large
                            deficits and vulnerable to the whims of the holders of its present heavy

                        <p>This might involve facing two problems: A controlled and limited
                            devaluation of 10-12% in order to make British goods competitive within
                            the Common Market; and the internationalization of Britain's

                            only permissive, and the President can, by executive decision, curtail

                        <p>We must dispel the British tendency to feel that she must choose between

                            unambiguous terms that we would find it easier to work with a Britain
                            that was leading the drive toward a unified Europe than with a Britain

                        <p rend="center">CONCLUSION</p>
                        <p>I have put forward the foregoing line of policy out of a deep conviction
                            that the steps outlined are essential to a stable and healthy
                            organization of Free World power.</p>
                        <p>I have no illusions as to what can be accomplished during <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s forthcoming visit.
                            Even if we strenuously urge the arguments I have set forth, the Prime
                            Minister would not immediately acquiesce. But we must make a start, and
                            time is not running on our side. We should use the opportunity of the
                            visit to begin the conditioning process.</p>
                        <p>For if we continue to pursue our present pattern of conversation with the
                            British—dealing with each problem on an ad hoc basis and
                            without a clear sense of where we want Britain to go in the
                            long-term— <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0590"/>we shall
                            do both ourselves and the British a tragic disservice. We shall retard a
                            process that must go forward quickly if we are to have stability in the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>After all, it is the timing that matters. Sooner or later the British
                            will be forced to abandon their pretensions to world power. Sooner or
                            later they will enter Europe. These processes are already in train.</p>
                        <p>But if we do not exercise our influence to speed them up, British actions
                            may once more be too little and too late—as has happened so
                            often in the past. Europe needs Britain to move toward unity. And, if
                            Britain does not take the decisive steps to identify herself with
                            Western European aspirations, the process of fragmentation may well
                            outrun any British contribution to cohesion. We shall
                            then—once again—be confronted with the conditions
                            of a new and dangerous instability.</p>

                            should make clear that we wish to widen the discussion, to deal with its
                            causes, rather than merely with its symptoms:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">We should press the Prime Minister to make clear to
                                the Six unequivocally the United Kingdom's desire to join

                            and to negotiate desired adjustments after entry. We should indicate to
                            the Prime Minister that, if the French response isolates sterling as the
                            main obstacle to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry, we would be
                            prepared to help in financial arrangements to overcome that obstacle.
                            Failing this, we would not be ready to join in further “bail
                            out” operations to help the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">We should encourage the United Kingdom to put

                                the United Kingdom's economic load</hi>. We should urge
                            that this be done within the context of a US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>

                            national nuclear programs, pending conclusion of an East-West agreement.
                            If necessary, we should exert leverage by suspending the flow of US
                            nuclear information to the United Kingdom under the 1958 amendment to

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said he was
                            pleased with the results of the Hague meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">Reference is to the July 25-26 meeting of U.S. and
                                West European Treasury Ministers.</note> What we had attained was
                            procedural rather than substantive, but it represented a real gain. The
                            discussions and negotiations were now in the larger group, and there was
                            hope of more progress on substance. He hoped there would be an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> resolution supporting the procedure at
                            this Fall's meeting, and his timetable for agreement in
                            substance was the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting in
                            September, 1967. The time for activation, of course, was open. It would
                            depend on circumstances as they developed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he hoped the U.S. and U.K. would continue to work
                            together, and anything the U.K. could do to help get the 1966 <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> resolution approved, they would do.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. U.K. Program</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that he
                            thought the U.K. measures had been well taken. He referred to the
                            comments he had made about them and the comments made at the Hague by
                            the other finance ministers.</p>
                        <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0592"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the measures had gone further than any
                            others so far and that he believed the wages/prices measures would have
                            to go further still. He doubted that they could rely solely on the
                            voluntary program. They needed additional statutory powers and probably
                            would seek them. Among such powers were those to literally break
                            strikes. The problem was very tough—particularly so for a
                            democracy.</p>
                        <p>He referred to the will of the U.K. Government to stand up and take a
                            hard line. He noted that, by so doing in the seaman's strike,
                            it had hurt sterling because the strike dragged on. He thought the
                            general comment on the strike settlement had missed this
                            point—the Government really had been tough and had insisted
                            on less than the employers were willing to pay. Yet comment on the
                            settlement seemed to indicate that the Government had been too easy.</p>
                        <p>He referred also to the problem of sterling balances and the apparently
                            general feeling that these were the cause of the present weakness. He
                            noted that this simply was not so. Selling of sterling had come from the
                            private side, including selling from the U.K. itself.</p>
                        <p>He reiterated his belief that there was absolutely no point in
                            devaluation. It would solve nothing. He wished the world—and
                            some elements in the U.K.—would understand that.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> noted a point
                            that had been made at the afternoon meeting at the
                            Treasury—that the wage/price pause could have an important
                            long-run effect. If the spiral of wage increases at a rate well above
                            productivity increases could be broken (as it had been in the U.S. in
                            the late 1950's), it could lead to cost stability for some
                            time. This was a very important factor.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that the U.S. now faced a problem of preventing a
                            breakout of wage and price increases. The U.S. problem was to orbit out
                            of a 5-1/2-6 percent real growth rate that was no longer sustainable as
                            our slack was being used up—to a rate of 4-1/2 percent, which
                            would be consonant with a low level of unemployment and high degree of
                            capital utilization. It was a difficult job.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he saw no real demand-pull inflation in the U.S.
                            as yet, but undoubtedly the seeds of cost-push inflation were there.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Conversations in Russia</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had had 9 hours with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>—5 hours alone,
                            except for 2 interpreters. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had been very frank. The Prime Minister had
                            asked if he wanted to be quoted to the President. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had said that he did not, but
                            he thought it would be useful if the Prime Minister reported his own
                            appraisal of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                            statements to the President.</p>
                        <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had stressed that the U.S. meant business
                            and that Hanoi had no hope of a U.S. weariness which would produce
                            withdrawal from Vietnam. He said he made this point a number of times.
                            He would be reporting to the President in detail about the
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. U.K. Role in the World</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he also wanted to discuss broadly U.S.-U.K.
                            relationships. In a sense, the U.K. was at a crossroads and had to come
                            to some conclusions about her future role.</p>
                        <p>George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he believed
                            the U.K. had to define—perhaps redefine—its role
                            in the world. For his part, he saw the U.K.'s major role as
                            leadership in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he did not want to be corralled into an
                            inward-looking Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he visualized the
                            U.K.'s leadership as taking Europe out of its inwardness.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he had asked Pompidou directly if the French
                            price for entry into the E.E.C. were political and if it involved the
                            U.K. turning its back on the U.S. He got no real answer.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that he
                            believed the U.K. should go into the E.E.C. from a position of strength
                            rather than weakness.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed with this view.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he
                            didn't know the strategy or the timing but that the U.K. and
                            U.S. should begin to work out jointly the U.K.'s role in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he was skeptical. His own posture was Atlantic.
                            He noted that the U.S. seemed to be shifting from an Atlantic to a
                            Pacific posture.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said his only
                            advice was “don't go in on French
                            terms.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that everything could
                            not be agreed in advance. Maybe it was better to get in and then
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister appeared unimpressed.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister in discussing visit to Soviet Union in larger groups said
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in course of nine
                            hours of conversations had given no encouragement whatsoever concerning
                            possibility of Geneva meeting on Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had been strongly critical of President but at
                            least as strong in criticizing Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> sincerely fears escalation Chinese intervention
                            and confrontation between US and China. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said he thought we may have been too complacent
                            in assumption Chinese would not come in. In response
                            Secretary's query <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said he thought <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in refusing to go to Geneva influenced more by
                            Chinese aspect than by Hanoi's views. Prime Minister said he
                            had pressed <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> hard on US
                            POW's in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>In discussing <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> balance of payments
                            problem Prime Minister pointed to 9% increase in exports in first five
                            months of 1966 including rise of 23% in exports to US but said economy
                            had been “blown off course” by sharp increase in
                            price imported materials, adverse capital <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0595"/>account movements, and worst of all seamen's
                            strike. He described Draconian measures adopted by his Government and
                            stressed his determination in dealing with situation. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said devaluation of sterling
                            would not be good thing recalling worldwide repercussions which followed
                            devaluation of the 30's. Prime Minister said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> financial problem had been exaggerated
                            and some British financiers showed their political prejudices in voicing

                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> and Secretary Fowler
                            exchanged views on problems of increasing international liquidity.
                            Secretary Fowler said there had been enough agreement at Hague meeting
                            of Group of Ten to enable us to move into <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. We should press hard with idea of establishing
                            machinery for handling liquidity problem in time for September 1967
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting. Prime Minister said it
                            was important to reach US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreement
                            before this meeting.</p>
                        <p>With respect overseas military expenditures Prime Minister said there
                            would be cuts. He would deal with confrontation situation in Malaysia
                            when it was clear confrontation had ended not before. Troops in Germany
                            presented difficult problem for both US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. President referred to prospect US ship purchases in
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to value of $23 million, $15
                            million from shifts of air units from France to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and purchase of Rolls Royce engines as adding up to $100
                            million. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> expressed
                            satisfaction with these arrangements. He suggested possibility of
                            withdrawing presence while maintaining commitment to Libya, reduction of
                            activities in Malta and hope US could help by increasing repair work US
                            Sixth Fleet in Malta.</p>
                        <p>In separate discussion with members of Prime Minister's party
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he did
                            not think Germans would agree to meet full British offset request.
                            Germans feel both US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces
                            overmanned and believe there must be cheaper way of maintaining these
                            forces. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said
                            this could be studied. For example, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            air squadrons in Germany could just as well be maintained in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Also we should take greater account of
                            air transport mobility and pay less attention to geography factor and
                            concentrate more on “time readiness.” Sir Burke
                            Trend said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had attempted to do this in
                            Defense Review and thought <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should
                            make systematic study of problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed but said study should proceed in way
                            which would not weaken public confidence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            noted that there are two parallel trends: one a feeling in Europe that
                            threat has lessened and on other hand danger that there will be loss of
                            confidence in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if military
                            structure weakened. Europeans feel they can relax their efforts but
                            expect US to continue its full contribution.</p>
                        <p>On question <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> membership in Common Market
                            Prime Minister said some people in his own party and most of press
                            thought <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0596"/>should cut world role and go
                            in. He said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> anxious to join on good
                            terms but not on French terms. French would insist <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> break its ties with US or at very least
                            abandon East of Suez position. Prime Minister thought time would come
                            when <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could enter Common Market under
                            satisfactory terms but that time not now. Sir Burke Trend said in
                            separate conversation with Secretary that even if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offered to sign on dotted line French would find some
                            other reason to prevent <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry.</p>
                        <p>In discussion of African problems with members of Prime
                            Minister's party Sir Burke Trend said Soviets do not appear
                            to place Africa at top of their priority list. Secretary noted prominent
                            role of Cubans in Congo Brazzaville.</p>
                        <p>On Rhodesia Sir Burke said sanctions biting hard but this not so apparent
                            to man in street and thus sanctions so far have had little political
                            effect. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                            sanctions had reduced economic activity in Rhodesia but political effect
                            at best unclear.</p>
                        <p>Secretary in discussing South Africa problem said it was possible
                            Africans would press issue hard in General Assembly in extremist form.
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it
                            might be difficult for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if it were
                            faced with decision of vetoing mandatory sanctions against South Africa.
                            When Ambassador Dean said there would first have to be finding of threat
                            to peace Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had already given way somewhat on this
                            point in the resolution concerning tankers off Beira. Discussion of arms

                            plans for cutbacks in their military spending in Europe as requested the

                                together with a statement the British representative would make at

                        </p>
                        <p>As regards the proposal to save from 5 to 8 million pounds by a reduction
                            in troop expenditures in Germany, this was obviously something solely
                            within the province of the British Government. We did not feel that we
                            should comment.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the proposal to save 15 million pounds in the logistics
                            area, our main concern was with the British plan to get down to a
                            ten-day supply situation. This would put the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> out of phase with our own arrangements. Even if <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was thinking of resupply from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, in a time of emergency the system
                            was likely to break down.</p>
                        <p>Our main concern was with the British plans for saving an additional 10
                            million pounds. We were particularly concerned with the discussion in
                            the British statement of the probable necessity to withdraw some combat
                            forces and with the implication in the statement that some action might
                            be taken by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in this regard before
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> mixed commission had a chance to report in the latter
                            part of September.</p>
                        <p>The injection of the possibility of a withdrawal of combat troops into
                            the <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> at this time would cause us great difficulties. <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0598"/>This news was bound to leak.
                            The resulting reaction in the U.S. would put pressure on us to unravel.
                            We also feared, particularly in view of the problems that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is now having, that a whole series of
                            adverse reactions would be triggered.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary and Mr. Johnson asked if the British in drawing up
                            their plans had taken into account the additional $20 million in foreign
                            exchange which would accrue to them as a result of our moving of three
                            reconnaissance and two troop transport squadrons from France to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. They also urged the British to
                            give us some time to see what might be done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Dean replied that he did not know if the extra foreign
                            exchange to be gained from the stationing of the U.S. squadrons in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had been taken into consideration
                            or not. His instructions were that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            was unable to postpone beyond Friday its statement to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. The Ministers who had approved the
                            statement had now left London on their holidays. It would be difficult
                            to make any changes. In effect, the U.S. was asking that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> eliminate entirely that part of its
                            statement dealing with the 10 million pounds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson replied that this was not really what we had in mind. We
                            merely wanted the British to indicate that they would not do anything
                            until after the mixed commission had reported. We also were urging that
                            there be no mention of withdrawals.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Dean said he thought amendments of this nature might not be so
                            difficult. He would report to London. He went on to say that if the U.S.
                            wished to go over the situation with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, he thought it would be best to hold talks in London
                            where the necessary facts were available.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary agreed with this suggestion and Mr. Johnson added
                            that it would probably not be possible for us to have the talks until
                            the following week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson raised another matter of concern to us. He said that it was
                            the understanding of General Wheeler, who had been briefed on British
                            plans by Admiral Henderson, that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            was unable to give any assurances that any troops returned from Germany
                            would be put into the Strategic Reserve. Ambassador Dean agreed that
                            such assurances could not be given.<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">At a
                                4:15 p.m. meeting that day, Dean reported that West German response
                                to contemplated British troop withdrawals was
                                “surprisingly mild” and handed the Acting
                                Secretary a redrafted version of page 4 of the British statement to

                        <p>On arrival in London, Sunday evening, I went directly to Chequers for
                            dinner and overnight. After dinner, there was a lengthy conversation in
                            the study. Present on the British side, besides Prime Minister and Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>, were the Lord
                            Chancellor, Lord Gardiner; Mr. Harold Davies, Parliamentary Secretary to
                            the Prime Minister; and Michael Palliser, Private Secretary to the Prime
                            Minister. On the American side, besides Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> and myself, were Ambassador and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, Mr. and Mrs. Dwayne Andreas,
                            and Ted Van Dyk of my staff.</p>
                        <p>Before dinner, Prime Minister asked me what reactions I had met on the
                            continent to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> initiatives towards the
                            Common Market. I told him that, in the Netherlands, Foreign Minister
                            Luns favored an immediate British initiative without delay, with full
                            acceptance of the Rome Treaty. In Germany, Willy Brandt had made clear
                            German support for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry, but
                            suggested that, after a declaration of intent now, he favored a series
                            of bilateral contacts until sometime in the fall. In Italy, Moro,
                            Saragat and Nenni had all indicated strong support for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entry and for a united Europe.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> indicated that he was now in
                            the process of consideration of Britain's tactics towards
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> membership.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, we gathered in the study. After brief preliminaries,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> brought up Vietnam and
                            asked for our assessment of the present situation there. I reviewed for
                            him the Guam Conference; the new American diplomatic team; the social,
                            political and economic programs underway there, and gave him a brief
                            review once more of our peace efforts.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s account of

                                345-365.</note> He said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> gave him an overwhelming impression of concern
                            over Communist China. Contrary to most other reports, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> believed that Red China wanted
                            to intervene in North Vietnam—in fact he talked in terms of
                            some three million Chinese troops. However, the leaders of North Vietnam
                            were struggling to prevent this intervention. He said that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> “spilled all the
                            beans” concerning his fears about China, that it was an
                            obsession. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stated any company selling
                            equipment to China would never get another Soviet order. He criticized
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> computer and Italian scientific
                            equipment sales to China. When <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said these sales were for peaceful purposes,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said they would be
                            used for military purposes. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said U.S. did not take the Chinese threat
                            seriously enough. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> feared
                            that we had not continued the last bombing pause for a long enough
                            period of time, that many people in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            believed the decision-making process in Hanoi could not move that
                            quickly.</p>
                        <p>Harold Davies, who knows Ho Chi Minh well and who had been to North
                            Vietnam and met with several of the leaders there, said that North
                            Vietnam leadership was far less monolithic than we might believe. There
                            were a number of factions. The men in Hanoi were experienced, cultured
                            diplomats—"real French-trained Elysée
                            men.” They were not single minded, Neanderthal people who
                            acted without reason. Yet, as one prominent physician had told him, they
                            have been fighting for years and were prepared to continue to fight
                            through their lifetimes and those of their children. The North
                            Vietnamese were resolute.</p>
                        <p>Davies felt that any attempt toward negotiation should be given ample
                            time for development. It was necessary not only for the people in North
                            Vietnam to discuss such a matter fully, among themselves, but it was
                            necessary to consult <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> representatives
                            all the way down to the lowest cadres. This could not be done
                            overnight.</p>
                        <p>Discussion then centered on how little was really known about the inside
                            politics in Hanoi and about where and how decisions were really made in
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had encouraged him to do
                            everything he could to work for a negotiated settlement in Vietnam.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> not to jeopardize his (<persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s) relationship with
                            Washington. He had no doubt that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> wanted a negotiated settlement. However, just as
                            we did not understand decision-making processes in North <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0601"/>Vietnam, the Soviets did not understand
                            decision-making processes and forces at work in US. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> still saw the possibility of
                            “American workers and peasants” rising up in
                            protest against the war. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            explained to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that
                            President Johnson did have strong support for his Vietnam policies. The
                            opposition was vocal and a minority.</p>
                        <p>In closing, <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> indicated that
                            he thought the key to peace lay through the Soviet Union and the key to
                            the Soviet Union lay with Britain. He felt that he had a real
                            opportunity to act as middleman between the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to reach a negotiated settlement. In
                            fact, he had been considering the possibility of moving more toward the
                            middle, between the two nations, on Vietnamese policy. If he did this,
                            he wanted us to understand that he was doing so in the interests of
                            peace and not because of any lack of friendship or loyalty to the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>I replied that such a shift by <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> would be misunderstood in the US and that in fact
                            it might result in increased pressure from “hawks”
                            for unilateral and strong US action to crush North Vietnam. It would be
                            unfortunate if Americans believed Britain was moving away from US on
                            this issue. The President appreciated <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s support and recognized the domestic
                            political pressures upon him. I told <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> he should thus consider very carefully any change
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position. I told him he would
                            jeopardize his relationship with the President if he followed any such
                            course. (I repeated this again to him today, urging that he keep in
                            close contact with the President, being mindful of the close
                            relationship between our countries and of the friendship of the
                            President. I believe I made my point.)</p>
                        <p>There followed a long discussion about British public opinion and
                            Vietnam. The Lord Chancellor, summing up, said that he believed most
                            Britishers were simply appalled by the bloodshed and destruction and did
                            not necessarily recognize the complicated issues involved. They saw the
                            war as being dangerous to them if it expanded. Beyond that, most of the
                            news carried by the media showed only American shooting and killing. It
                            seemed to most people that we were a big country applying a great amount
                            of force against a small country. Also, the Ky government was highly
                            unpopular in Britain and that was harmful to public opinion. Our story
                            has obviously not been effectively told in Europe. TV in particular has
                            been damaging to our image.</p>
                        <p>I reviewed in detail the progress made under the Ky government and our
                            assessment of that government, as well as the present development toward
                            democratic institutions there.</p>
                        <p>I closed by suggesting that <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>
                            and others would do well to apply moral pressure on Hanoi as moral
                            pressure was being applied against the US. He indicated that this would
                            be useful and he would see what he could do in discussions with European
                            leaders.</p>

                        <p>1. We are well aware of the United Kingdom's economic,
                            budgetary and foreign exchange difficulties which lie at the heart of
                            the decision being considered to reduce your forces in
                            Singapore-Malaysia by about one-half over the next four years.
                            Nonetheless, we are deeply concerned at the idea of your making
                            significant reductions in force unless and until there is a real change
                            in the Vietnam situation.</p>
                        <p>2. What concerns us even more gravely are the indications you gave us
                            that a further and more far-reaching decision is in contemplation to
                            withdraw entirely from the Singapore-Malaysia bases by the
                            mid-1970's, to have Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> inform Singapore and Malaysia of this
                            contemplated decision, and to announce it before Parliament rises in
                            July in conjunction with new statement of your Defense policy.</p>
                        <p>3. As I understand it the case for taking that much more fundamental
                            decision rests on several grounds:</p>
                        <p>A. A reduction in your presence will not produce large financial savings,
                            only a complete withdrawal will accomplish that.</p>
                        <p>B. You are under great domestic pressures for this and other reasons to
                            tell the country what your intentions are in the area.</p>
                        <p>C. Your Forces must know clearly and precisely what your policy is in
                            order to plan their programs over the next ten years.</p>
                        <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>D. You believe that an indefinite continued presence in the area will
                            prove unacceptable locally, and it will only complicate the problems of
                            those in power. By announcing a timetable for withdrawal now, you
                            believe the critics of your presence will be disarmed.</p>
                        <p>E. It is essential that Malaysia and Singapore know what is in store so
                            that you can together plan for an orderly withdrawal with a minimum of
                            dislocation.</p>
                        <p>4. While I appreciate the force of some of these arguments, I would argue
                            against major reductions in the near future, more strongly against any
                            decision now as to what you contemplate after 1971, and even more
                            strongly against any announcement now of any intentions to withdraw from
                            the area.</p>
                        <p>5. My concerns arise from the consequent reactions—the chain
                            reactions—that would be set in motion in the US and elsewhere
                            by such an action.</p>
                        <p>A. For the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to announce that you will no
                            longer carry this burden (even at a future date) at the very moment when
                            we are deeply involved in Vietnam and when Thailand is under threat,
                            would have the most serious effects here. Surely Britain shares our
                            views that what we are doing in Vietnam is of vital strategic importance
                            to us and to our Allies. But those articulate groups here who question
                            our presence in Vietnam and our commitments to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> will argue even more forcefully that your withdrawal
                            shows clearly that there are no vital national or international
                            interests in this area for us to defend, that we should have never gone
                            in, and that we too should withdraw.</p>
                        <p>B. There are those here in important positions in the Senate who want us
                            to reduce our commitment to Europe. Should you announce that you are
                            withdrawing from Singapore and Malaysia on the grounds you cannot carry
                            that burden, I foresee an increase in the intensity of their criticism,
                            arguing that we too have a limit to our capacity to carry these burdens
                            and we should cut further and heavily in Europe.</p>
                        <p>C. The strength of our position in the US in assuming international
                            commitments in these last twenty years is that we have always been able
                            to say that we have Allies who share our views and share our burden, and
                            not least the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The defection of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has hurt us. If now
                            there was a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> withdrawal from this area
                            it would be regarded as a similar defection, encouraging the
                            neoisolationists, and encouraging the critics of our policies both in
                            Asia and in Europe.</p>
                        <p>D. I am also concerned as to how your withdrawal would be viewed in Hanoi
                            and Peking, where it would be treated as a victory for them, as a
                            repudiation of your support of our position in the area, and as a
                            further weakening of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>E. I am particularly concerned as to the effect in the immediate area of
                            an announcement of what you will do in the 1970's. With the
                                <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0604"/>great change in

                                national leader.</note> there is now the prospect that something
                            might be built in the next decade in the way of regional associations
                            for economic and eventually defense purposes. We do not share the view
                            that the people in Malaysia and Singapore long to see you leave. Lee has
                            said again and again that he values your presence, and sees no hostility
                            in Malaysia. The free Asian countries would prefer a friendly white
                            presence to a hostile Chinese. Your continued presence and your
                            experienced hand could do much to keep the situation stable and to
                            foster and encourage these promising developments, whereas the
                            announcement of your withdrawal could set in motion strains and
                            ambitions that could keep this area in turmoil. If there is any thought
                            that we might be able to take on your commitments when you left, as we
                            did in Greece,<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">Reference is to 1947 events
                                that led to the enunciation of the Truman Doctrine and major U.S.
                                involvement in Greece.</note> I must say at once that there is no
                            sentiment in this country to take on additional commitments in any
                            area.</p>
                        <p>5. In short, we understand your desire to reduce your forces and base
                            structure in Malaysia and Singapore. We hope this can be done in a
                            gradual and reasonable way without significant withdrawals before a
                            Vietnam settlement, for we feel that your presence continues to play a
                            major role in the security and stability of the area. But above all we
                            hope you can avoid taking, or in any event making public in any way,
                            basic decisions at this point on withdrawal by the
                                mid-1970's.<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">In a May 1 letter

                        <p>Dear Dean:</p>
                        <p>Last week George Brown telephoned me to say he wished urgently to talk to
                            me privately and unofficially—I was to be alone and he would
                            have Paul Gore-Booth with him.</p>
                        <p>We met on Friday night<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">May 5.</note> at the
                            Embassy residence, and no notes were taken. He prefaced his conversation
                            by saying his call was unofficial, and for the exchange of private
                            views. Then he added that what he would discuss was British plans for
                            reducing their military commitments East of Suez and eliminating them
                            entirely in Singapore and Malaysia by 1975.</p>
                        <p>I told him I was particularly glad he would do so, since before he had
                            phoned me, I had already decided, even in the absence of instructions
                            from home, to ask him to see me as a friend, and allow me to state my
                            strong misgivings over what was proposed, the manner in which the matter
                            was being treated by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>, and the
                            intention to make a public announcement about it in July, 1967.</p>
                        <p>I said I had read various memcons on the subject, and wondered whether
                            his people appreciated how dangerous and inflammatory this situation
                            could become.</p>
                        <p>He answered that he realized this, and was deeply troubled over it. His
                            own judgment differed somewhat from that of certain of his colleagues,
                            and also, in a few particulars, from that of the Foreign Office;
                            Gore-Booth would tell me about the latter.</p>
                        <p>George then made a lucid and comprehensive survey of the situation,
                            stressing particularly (1) the financial considerations, and (2) the
                            domestic political pressures for an early announcement by his Government
                            of its intention to quit the Singapore region by 1975.</p>
                        <p>Everything he adduced has already been so amply argued by him in
                            Washington that it is needless for me to repeat it here.</p>
                        <p>In fact, I am writing you solely because of his insistence that I do so,
                            and that I ask you to communicate his reflections only to the President,
                            and to no one on your and the White House staff!</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0606"/>
                        <p>Frankly, Dean, I am at a loss to know exactly what he thinks I might
                            convey of which you are not already apprised. I can only guess that
                            after his return from Washington he appreciated (especially in the light
                            of your message to him of April 21,<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">

                                Singapore, Australian, and New Zealand Governments for the purpose

                            explosiveness of this material.</p>
                        <p>The only areas in which he indicated any possible changes were: (1)
                            Although all ground troops should be removed from Singapore and Malaysia
                            by 1975, he might advocate in Cabinet the retention of a considerable
                            Naval and Air Force capability in the area. (2) He thought he might
                            advise the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> not to get frozen on a July
                            announcement date before the Washington meeting on June 2.</p>
                        <p>Paul Gore-Booth then, at <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George
                                Brown</persName>'s instigation, exposed the Foreign
                            Office case. The most important points were that the <gloss target="#t_FO1">FO</gloss> thought there should be further
                            interchanges between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, US and other
                            Governments most concerned before any final decision by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>; and, secondly, that although the
                                <gloss target="#t_FO1">FO</gloss> officials were without competence
                            to assess the exigencies of British party politics, must a July
                            announcement be made, and also could not any determination on ultimate
                            and complete withdrawal be “fuzzed” in public
                            statements?</p>
                        <p>In my reply, I hope I did not depart far, if at all, from what you and
                            the President would have wished, and would have authorized me to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>I was careful again to point out that my remarks were reflective of
                            entirely private opinions.</p>
                        <p>I thought:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Cabinet should take no binding decision until the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had seen the President in Washington on
                            June 2.</p>
                        <p>(2) This affair (involving the way in which <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> seemed intent on making a unilateral determination,
                            and, announcing it in July, eight years in advance of its being carried
                            into effect) struck me as more likely to cause bitter controversy

                            any other issue between us during the last few years.</p>
                        <p>(3) I was unimpressed by the alleged necessity of announcement in July,
                            before the Parliament rose, and equally so by the supposed necessity of
                            having this time table known before the Labour Party Conference in
                            September. Even assuming, from the standpoint of domestic politics, such
                            an action was deemed highly desirable, should not <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0607"/>the vastly more important
                            considerations of international relations have paramount place?</p>
                        <p>(4) I ventured to say that if the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> were
                            to present his decision as a fait accompli to our President on June 2,
                            and to try to justify it, and a July announcement, on the ground of his
                            domestic political pressures, he would be inviting, and in my opinion
                            recklessly, a possible rebuke of really titanic proportions.</p>
                        <p>We had our own domestic political difficulties in much more acute degree
                            than those afflicting the Labour party. Moreover, the appearance of our
                            being, by inference, deserted (for that is how the project would be
                            analyzed) in the midst of our Vietnamese involvement, by a Government
                            assumed to be our most reliable ally, headed by a Prime Minister who had
                            repeatedly declared himself an “East of Suez Man”,
                            would seem to me unwise, provocative, and absolutely unacceptable to us,
                            to our public opinion, or to our fighting allies, to say nothing of
                            Singapore, Malaysia, and most of the rest of Asia.</p>
                        <p>I appreciated the fact we were conversing in secrecy, and on a basis of
                            personal friendship. On that same basis, I would ask George to regard my
                            reflex as one I felt sure would be generally shared at home. This was
                            not merely a question of handling a British budget, or planning their
                            future defense dispositions; it involved the whole structure of the
                            Anglo-American relationship, and of stability in Asia.</p>
                        <p>If I were he, I would advise the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> not to
                            get into a fixed position, to keep his options open, and if he has
                            radically altered his policy about previous East of Suez commitments, to
                            say so when he sees the President—meanwhile to leave the
                            matter undecided.</p>
                        <p>I apologize for sending you this long and wearisome letter, but having
                            told George I would make, at his insistence, some sort of report, here
                            it is, though it consists so much of “I saids” and
                            does nothing to illuminate this dark problem.</p>
                        <p>I believe Brown is seriously disturbed over the prospect of trouble on
                            this issue. Fortunately, he has acquired respect for the opinion of
                            Gore-Booth, who shares, within the limits of bureaucratic loyalty, my
                            convinced opposition to the way in which the matter is currently being
                            approached. Brown stated that the affair has no connection in his mind
                            with Britain's attempt to get into the European complex.
                            Also, he is, more than any other Cabinet member, except possibly the
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, anxious to preserve close comity

                            current connexion.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest if you feel so inclined, you consider sending a message
                            to him in some such terms as these:</p>

                        <p>9929. For the Secretary from Bruce.</p>
                        <p>1. The Prime Minister will come to Washington Friday expecting US
                            interest to focus on international affairs; his own approach to these
                            problems may be largely governed by British domestic preoccupations.
                            Important as the Far East and Middle East are, for the British they are
                            less compelling than domestic economics and politics and the Common
                            Market. Since the sterling crisis of July 1966 the Prime Minister has
                            been progressively committing himself to a bold political
                            gamble—a set of policy commitments that are, in the short
                            run, economically painful and politically distasteful to the British
                            people—trusting to long-term results for his political
                            vindication. Deflation, tight control of wages and price, rising
                            unemployment, defense at the expense of social welfare-these are
                            shorthand reminders of the host of domestic issues that now beset him.
                            Things will get worse before they get better. The latest (April)
                            indicators show unemployment still rising, production sluggish, and a
                            further rise in imports as against exports. Even public support for the
                            Common Market bid, in the wake of DeGaulle's public
                                opposition,<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">The British Government
                                announced its decision to apply for membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> on May. At a May 16 press
                                conference, President de Gaulle ruled out British membership in the
                                Common Market at that time citing the disruptive effects of the
                                continuing sterling crisis on the process of economic
                                integration.</note> is slipping according to the polls.</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0609"/>
                        <p>2. In the face of these problems, the Prime Minister has bet nearly all
                            his political stack of chips on his Common Market application. Now,
                            having done so, he finds himself in trouble because of
                            DeGaulle's intransigence, even perhaps on the question of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. While <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> has persevered in
                            his long-range strategy through the winter and the spring, the political
                            cost has mounted. Labor has slipped badly in Parliamentary by-elections
                            and lost disastrously in the nationwide local elections.
                            Labor's public support has been steadily declining in the
                            polls; in the past two months, for the first time in over three years,
                            the Conservatives hold a lead in public favor. Even the Prime
                            Minister's personal popularity in the polls, always higher
                            than his party's, is down.</p>
                        <p>4. Along with widespread public disaffection, there is trouble within the
                            Labor Party. Large scale revolts in the Parliamentary Party on the
                            defense budget and the Common Market application have posed a serious
                            disciplinary problem. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s tough and sensational lecture to a
                            Parliamentary Party meeting in March had at best a temporary effect.
                            While the trouble is mainly on the left, it spreads across the party.
                            The defense budget, East of Suez, the Common Market, Vietnam, and
                            domestic economic policies each have their special critics. While they
                            may not all unite on one issue, their sum is a range of discontent that
                            infects a large section of the party. Even the loyalists are unhappy
                            over the Prime Minister's failure to punish leftist
                            rebels.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> has shown no signs of
                            retreat on what he regards as the basic issues—the domestic
                            economy and the Common Market—to placate his critics. On the
                            contrary, he continues to take a position well ahead of his party (and
                            apparently) of the general public, counting on the fact that, between
                            now and 1971, he can pick his own most favorable moment for a general
                            election.</p>
                        <p>6. Nevertheless, no leader can be indifferent to the pressures <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> is under, and he must, so far as
                            possible, do what he can to improve his present political position. He
                            is putting a lot of personal effort into repairing his intra-party
                            fences and trying to damp down the harmful and publicly visible squabble
                            within the Labor Party. Most important, he is unquestionably looking for
                            issues on which, without sacrifice of his basic purposes, he can make
                            some concession to public and party disaffection.</p>
                        <p>7. There may be, for example, some minor improvements in social welfare
                            programs in July mini-budget and as wage increases are reviewed on a
                            case-by-case basis, there may be some politically useful concessions
                            there (the government has conceded that it expects wages to rise six
                            percent during this calendar year and some politically important wage
                            claims are pending).</p>
                        <p>8. In this context, the proposed East of Suez reductions are particularly
                            significant. An announcement in July of substantial saving in <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0610"/>that area, looking ahead to
                            what may otherwise be a stormy Labor Party conference in September, is
                            probably the juiciest bone he can throw his critics. It commends itself
                            in both budgetary and foreign exchange savings (at a time when no other
                            sources for welfare spending and investment incentives are in view) and
                            it appeals to the growing number who, for doctrinal and emotional
                            reasons, want to reduce Britain's world role, furthermore, it
                            is thought by some to strengthen the Common Market bid.</p>
                        <p>9. The Prime Minister is, thus, under heavy political fortune. There is
                            no sign, however, that he is weakening in his long-term strategy. He is
                            deeply committed on both domestic economic policy and the Common Market;
                            it would probably be as costly to retreat as to see it through (though
                            what to do if the Common Market bid fails must be now an uncomfortable
                            question).</p>
                        <p>10. In this difficult situation, the Prime Minister shows every sign of
                            keeping his nerve. He is visibly self confident, retains all his skill
                            and aplomb in public performance, and apparently continues his mastery
                            over his Cabinet and his party. He is helped, of course, by Tory
                            weakness; the swing in public opinion seems more an expression of
                            dissatisfaction with Labor than of support for the Tories.
                            Heath's personal popularity remains at a low level.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> will probably hold to
                            his present course and he is giving an impressive exhibition of skillful
                            and courageous leadership, but one should not underestimate his
                            difficulties or the stresses on him. Even within his Cabinet, he is
                            under real pressure to retreat on issues not central to
                            Labor's political fortunes or to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> economy but of great interest to the United
                            States—issues like Vietnam, the basic East of Suez policy,
                            and even, perhaps, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s
                            role in the present Middle East crisis.</p>
                        <p>12. When I come to the Department on Thursday morning I hope for an
                            opportunity to discuss UKG's attitude toward the Middle East

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> visited
                            Washington June 2-3, 1967, for talks with U.S. officials. According to a
                            note on the preparatory briefing books for this meeting, no formal
                            memoranda of conversation of the President's discussions with
                            the Prime Minister were prepared. The preparatory documents for the

                            discussions were dominated by a rapidly escalating crisis in the Middle
                            East, which erupted into war on June 4. Memoranda of conversation are in

                        </p>
                        <p>As you know, the General Assembly has been having a week's
                            breathing space in which to see whether agreement can be reached on any
                            form of words.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Middle East in
                                the aftermath of the Six-Day War.</note> But all the signs so far
                            bear out your doubts about the likelihood of any significant closing of
                            the gap between the two positions taken in the Assembly on the main
                            issue. I have found it reassuring that a substantial part of the
                            membership—and notably the Latin
                            Americans—insisted on a balanced resolution (providing for an
                            end to the state of belligerency as well as Israel's
                            withdrawal), or none. The Soviet Union and the less reasonable Arabs
                            have certainly been given good cause for reconsidering, though I also
                            agree with you that it may <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0612"/>be a
                            little time before any shift becomes discernible. But at least the
                            atmosphere is now very different from what it was when the slanging
                            match first began. It is also a good sign that the Security Council have
                            now agreed to permit U Thant to arrange with the Israelis and Egyptians
                            for United Nations troops to be stationed along the sides of the
                                canal.<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">On July 8 the Secretary-General
                                informed the Security Council that he had initiated talks with
                                Israel and Egypt to place observers on their respective sides of the
                                canal cease-fire line. On July 9 the Security Council authorized the
                                Chief of Staff, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Truce Supervisory
                                Organization, to work out arrangements for placement of peacekeeping
                                troops on both sides of the canal.</note> This agreement should be
                            used as a first step towards establishing a U.N. presence elsewhere in
                            the area. It is a hopeful sign too that U Thant has now appointed a
                            Swede to pursue the refugee problem. A really determined and imaginative
                            effort by the international community is now needed to solve this
                            problem. We ought perhaps to examine what part a comprehensive
                            development plan might play in all this. In general I think we should go
                            on concentrating through the Security Council, on discussion of
                            practical matters, pressing particularly for the appointment of a
                            representative of the Secretary General, on developing the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in the area and tackling the
                            issues affecting freedom of passage through the water-ways.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Far East we have, as I am sure you know, been giving very
                            earnest and deep consideration to this problem since I saw you last
                            month. We have discussed it here with Harold Holt, Marshall from New
                            Zealand, Harry Lee from Singapore and, most recently, with the Tunku.
                            All have expressed their concern about our longer-term intentions and,
                            while the considerations that you and they have in mind differ in many
                            respects from country to country (as one would expect), we fully
                            understand the fundamental concern that is shared in common by you all.
                            And, as I explained to you we not only understand this but we sympathise
                            with it and wish to do everything we can to mitigate it. We have planned
                            to phase our withdrawal over a period of years so as to reduce the
                            likelihood of any lasting setback to the economies of the countries in
                            the area; and our mitigating aid coupled with their own determination to
                            help themselves will contribute positively to the kind of self-reliant
                            future at which the whole area should aim.</p>
                        <p>The British Government have had to reach their decisions, after the
                            fullest consultation with their friends and allies and taking due
                            account of their views, on the basis of their own best judgment of what
                            is politically and economically right for this country. The decision we
                            have now taken has been reached in the light of the best assessment we
                            can make of the likely development of political relationships in the
                            area in <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0613"/>the second half of the
                            next decade; and of the economic requirements if Britain is to play any
                            continuing part there at that time. We in this country will be unable to
                            play any such part—or indeed any effective part in world
                            affairs as a whole—unless we get our economy straight now;
                            and to do this we have no option but to bring our defence spending into
                            line with our resources, while making full use of these resources to
                            achieve our political objectives. If this is to be achieved, it requires
                            long-term decisions about the overall shape of our forces and about
                            weapon systems which we must take now. I repeat that the views that you
                            and the heads of the Commonwealth governments concerned have expressed
                            to us have been taken into the fullest account and we are grateful for
                            the frankness, and also for the spirit of friendly understanding in
                            which they have been expressed. My colleagues and I have decided that it
                            is politically and economically right for us to reduce our forces in
                            Singapore and Malaysia to about half the current levels by 1970-71 and
                            to plan on leaving the mainland of Southeast Asia entirely by the middle
                            seventies. But because we are equally resolved that Britain shall have a
                            continuing part to play in the area, though one that must be
                            commensurate with our resources, we shall also plan to retain a
                            sophisticated military capability for use if required in the Far East
                            after that time. For it really is nonsense for us to offer to provide
                            independently ground troops to defend Asian countries who have it in
                            their power to train and provide their own. What we can do and intend to
                            do is to maintain a military capability for use in the area which
                            provides the sophisticated sea-air support which they cannot afford to
                            provide as an assurance against external aggression. In the further
                            round of consultations just completed, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers
                            have, I think, been impressed by the likely scale and character of this
                            capability.</p>
                        <p>Now that we have taken this decision, the question
                            arises—again in the light of what you and our Commonwealth
                            colleagues have said—whether we can avoid announcing it
                            publicly at this time. The fact is that so much has appeared publicly in
                            various parts of the world about our long-term intentions (and this was
                            certainly not something that we either wished or accept responsibility
                            for) that it is simply impossible for us now to avoid giving some public
                            indication of what they are. Otherwise there is a real risk that it may
                            be believed that we are planning a more rapid rundown than is in fact
                            the case. In any event, we must in all fairness give our armed forces
                            some idea of their long term size, shape and equipment when the process
                            is completed in the middle 1970s, particularly as the careers of many
                            are involved. This is difficult unless we indicate the major premise on
                            which our planning is based. In any case, as the process gets under way
                            in the coming months our long term intentions are bound to become known.
                            Even if we ourselves <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0614"/>attempted
                            to disguise them, other governments concerned might not be able to avoid
                            some disclosures in order to kill rumours and speculation and to explain
                            the consequential adjustments to their own policy. I believe a
                            continuation of the present uncertainty would be damaging to us all. But
                            we are anxious to do all we can to meet your concern by avoiding
                            anything too specific.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in the Defence White Paper that we shall be presenting to
                            Parliament shortly, we propose to say that, while we plan to withdraw
                            altogether from our bases in Singapore and Malaysia in the middle 1970s,
                            the precise timing of our eventual withdrawal will depend on progress
                            made in achieving a new basis for stability in Southeast Asia and in
                            resolving other problems in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>I know that this will be unwelcome news to you. But these decisions have
                            been taken for reasons which seem right to us, and after the most
                            prolonged consideration and consultation. I am convinced that, if this
                            country is in the future to be the same kind of effective partner for
                            her friends and allies in the world as she has, I hope, been in the
                            past, the political and economic realities must be faced and not fudged;
                            and, in particular, that our essential objective of building an
                            unshakeable economic base for Britain is the right one not only for this
                            country but for all our allies as well. I believe that, in deciding and
                            announcing now our intention to maintain a military capability for use
                            in the Far East after the mid 1970s, we are demonstrating our continued
                            interest in the area.</p>
                        <p>The two Asian governments most directly concerned have demonstrated an
                            impressive steadiness in this new situation, they have recognised the
                            inevitability of change: they take the point I have made above about the
                            need for them to make the contribution to their own defence that best
                            accords with their own resources, while we help with a</p>
                        <p>more sophisticated capability: and they have shown a readiness to
                            co-operate with us in effecting an orderly transition to the new basis
                            for stability in Southeast Asia which is our aim. The fact that it is
                            very much in their interest that they should do so does not detract from
                            the value or significance of the wise way in which they have reacted to
                            our new policy. I am sure that we can count on the same degree of
                            understanding and positive co-operation from our other allies.</p>
                        <p>I have gone into all this at considerable length and detail because of
                            the frankness and straightforward approach that has always characterised
                            the exchanges between us. But you will realise how essential it is to
                            hold this information very tight until our White Paper is published. I
                            know I can rely on your total discretion here.</p>

                            on July 18, at 9:30 a.m. Washington time. He then read from the attached

                            the British decisions were most disappointing to us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said that, in all candor, he
                            could not see political wisdom in announcing now the total withdrawal
                            which would not take place until the mid-70's. Ambassador
                            Dean replied that the British Government was certain that this decision
                            would become known regardless of whether or not there was an
                            announcement. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had concluded that it

                        <p>Ambassador Dean said that the President yesterday had given him a full
                            account of the bombing policy,<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">No record of
                                this meeting was found.</note> had assured him nothing was new, and
                            had indicated that this present program would probably end by
                            mid-September. Sir Patrick noted that the call to come to the White
                            House had coincided with instructions from London to try to see the
                            President on this subject. Sir Patrick asked if the Secretary saw better
                            prospects on the diplomatic front after mid-September.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that hardly a week went by without an effort to
                            test Hanoi, but the reactions continued to be negative.</p>
                        <p>Sir Patrick asked if we had any reason to think that increasing the
                            military pressure would help. The Secretary replied that there was no
                            reason to think decreasing the pressure would make a difference. As for
                            the previous limits on our bombing program, we imposed these limits
                            ourselves. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese have been using the area in
                            the far north as a safe haven for their logistical buildup. The
                            Secretary said that the other governments with troops in South Viet-Nam
                            attached great importance to our bombing in the North.</p>

                        <p>37244. Pass to Under Secretary Rostow.</p>
                        <p>1. Senate today voted 49-29 to incorporate Byrnes Amendment<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">For text of this amendment to P.L. 96-90, the
                                Defense Appropriations Act of 1968, approved September 29, 1967, see
                                81 Stat. 238.</note> into Defense Appropriations Bill. This
                            confirmed House action yesterday and provided that none of these
                            appropriated funds shall be used for construction of any naval vessel in
                            foreign shipyards.</p>
                        <p>2. This threatens right of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to bid on
                            16 minesweepers which Navy had previously selected as appropriate for
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> competition under offset
                            agreement. As funds for 9 of these 16 provided under <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 and 67 Defense Appropriations Acts,
                            and thereby not affected by Byrnes Amendment, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> may have some expectation that they eligible to bid and
                            to win orders on these 9, even if ineligible to bid on 7 being funded
                            under <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 Act. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is currently examining these and other prospects, but
                            not yet prepared to encourage or discourage <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> expectations.</p>
                        <p>3. If as we expect <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> raises question of
                            8 minesweepers, believe <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> should not
                            be encouraged in any optimistic expectations. We can say that DOD is
                            currently searching every means to permit British to bid on as fair and
                            equal terms as possible for 9. Further, we can convey assurance that
                            nothing in Byrnes Amendment will prevent <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> fulfilling the $325 million and supplementary offset

                        </list>
                        <p>At Tab A is Joe Fowler's memo<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> recommending an increase of $100 million in the
                            funds he has available for market operations to support sterling.</p>
                        <p>What it comes down to is this.</p>
                        <p>Today's increase in the discount rate is part of the last
                            ditch British effort to hold the sterling rate. As you know, they moved
                            strongly last year to support the pound: they deflated their economy,
                            cut down foreign commitments and borrowed heavily abroad.</p>
                        <p>The program worked well through the first quarter of this year. They were
                            able to pay off more than $1 billion in debt. Then they ran into bad
                            luck:</p>
                        <p>—disappointing exports, largely because of the recession on
                            the continent;</p>
                        <p>—the Middle East crisis and the closure of the Canal;</p>
                        <p>—rising interest rates elsewhere while theirs were going
                            down.</p>
                        <p>They began to lose reserves and had to draw heavily on their line of
                            short term credits.</p>
                        <p>The increase in the bank rate is designed to draw funds back to London.
                            The market's initial reaction was slightly disappointing
                            because some expected a higher increase in the rate. But sterling is
                            holding steady because of support operations.</p>
                        <p>Through selective and carefully timed actions, we have operated
                            successfully in the market in the past to keep the rate from worsening
                            on bad news or to strengthen it on good news. We do so at our own
                            discretion but in cooperation with the British.</p>
                        <p>We now have $160 million available for this purpose. Fowler recommends
                            that you authorize him to make $100 million more available out of the
                            Exchange Stabilization Fund. This would give the necessary leeway to
                            have a maximum impact on the market-either to continue defensive
                            operations or to take advantage of favorable opportunities.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0619"/>
                        <p>These funds are guaranteed against loss from devaluation. There is no
                            balance of payments effect. If the funds are used, it would in effect
                            amount to an increase in our lending to the U.K.</p>
                        <p>This is a contingency investment that could be used very effectively to
                            support sterling. I believe Fowler's proposal makes sense.
                            Deming, Okun, Daane and Fried who have gone into it carefully concur in
                            the recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Your decision is needed as soon as possible so that our people in the
                            exchange market will know how much ammunition they have and plan their

                        <p>I note you are seeing Joe Fowler at noon today.<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">No record of the meeting was found.</note> He may
                            have to give you some background on the sterling crisis on which we may
                            need a decision from you later in the day. We do not yet have all the
                            information to put the issues properly before you.</p>
                        <p>The British came in Saturday to tell Fowler they were near the end of the
                            line. Without assurance of long-term credit they may have to
                            devalue—perhaps within a week. Their line of short-term
                            credit is down to $600 to $800 million. The announcement of poor trade
                            figures on Tuesday could keep the pound under pressure.</p>
                        <p>I won't go into the pros and cons of letting the pound go. The
                            main point is the risks for us are just too great to be worth the
                            gamble—if it can be avoided through a good multilateral
                            support operation. The European Central Bankers seem to be of the same
                            mind.</p>
                        <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0620"/>
                        <p>It may be possible therefore to work out a support package through a
                            large <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stand-by credit, through a
                            package of bilateral credits and swaps, or through a combination of
                            both. There would be no budgetary or direct balance-of-payments costs
                            for us in any action we might consider, and it would have to be
                            multilateral or not at all.</p>
                        <p>It is our feeling, and it seems to be that of the Europeans, that this
                            would be the last try at supporting sterling. But it would be well worth
                            it, if it can be pulled off.</p>

                        <p>71785. Circular Cable for Guidance of U.S. Missions overseas.</p>
                        <p>1. British Government has notified <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> of
                            intention to set a new par value for sterling of $2.40. This represents
                            devaluation of 14.3 percent. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            approved this action this morning to be announced 2130 <gloss target="#t_GMT1">GMT</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">For text
                                of Chancellor of the Exchequer Callaghan's statement,
                                issued November 18, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                1967, pp. 194-195.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. U.S. view is that under existing circumstances what British have done
                            is both necessary and desirable. We wish make sure action is effective
                            and that similar action is limited to handful of countries with very
                            special problems and virtual dependence on U.K. and only then through
                            normal <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> procedures. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. This means Ireland almost surely and
                            possibly although we hope not New Zealand and Denmark. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. reaffirms commitment to buy and sell gold to foreign official
                            holders of dollars at $35 an ounce. Similar exchange rate actions by any
                            significant number of important trading countries would put pressure on
                            U.S. dollar. Furthermore, until intentions of major countries are made
                            public uncertainty may lead to speculative pressure.</p>

                        <p>4. We are hopeful governments will announce promptly intentions to
                            maintain their present par values. To this end U.S. is initiating series
                            moves to reduce uncertainty and calm foreign exchange markets. We are
                            undertaking series of direct high-level telephone contacts between U.S.
                            officials and Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of major
                            countries, approaches by Diplomatic Missions in other areas,
                            announcement of our own intentions.</p>
                        <p>5. U.S. will issue public statement which will be transmitted by
                            immediate cable as soon as issued.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">The White

                        <p>Following letter from <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> Healey to Sec
                            Def <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> given to EmbOff at
                            10:00 P.M. 18 Nov. for urgent transmission.</p>
                        <p>“Dear Bob</p>
                        <p>You will just have heard of the new economic measures announced by the
                            Prime Minister including cuts in public expenditure for the financial
                                <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0622"/>year 1968/69. Inevitably
                            these cuts include a reduction in defence expenditure. In the summer we
                            said we expected that defence expenditure in 1968/69 would be below a
                            target of 2000 million pounds (at 1964 prices). We now plan that it will
                            be below 1,900 million pounds. Some of this reduction will arise not
                            from new programme cuts, but from processes of financial refinement and
                            rephasing of production expenditure. For presentational reasons it may
                            be necessary for us to lay particular stress on the programme cuts.</p>
                        <p>2. In searching for economies I have been most anxious not to make
                            changes in the pattern of defence policy as we formulated it in July,
                            particularly as regards our political commitments, the deployment of
                            forces and the major elements in our military capabilities. While I have
                            not yet decided finally on the make-up of the reduction, I am now
                            hopeful that I can maintain these conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. Though of course, my colleagues in the Cabinet will have their say
                            before final decisions are taken, I hope to prevent the economies
                            affecting any of our major US purchasing programmes—the
                            F.111, Phantom or C.130—though it may be necessary for us not
                            to proceed with the Chinook deal. As you will appreciate, such an
                            economy would have a presentational value greater than its military or
                            financial significance.</p>
                        <p>4. You will be particularly interested in whether there is any major
                            consequence for the Far East and the Gulf. Again, I hope to avoid this,
                            though inevitably there may be one or two minor adjustments in the
                            phasing of re-equipment. But, given the broader context and our desire
                            to preserve other parts of our programme it is clear that we shall be
                            unable to go ahead with the Aldabra project. This was, as you and I
                            agreed in Ankara, a marginal option. In the pressure of priorities I can
                            no longer see a space for it, particularly as its elimination will have
                            a bigger public impact than its military cost or value might justify. It
                            may therefore be necessary for us to announce the decision on Aldabra
                            very early next week. I am sorry about this especially after all the
                            hard preparatory work put in by both our staffs.</p>
                        <p>5. I hope to be able to discuss all this in greater detail with you at
                            Brussels, when my detailed plans will be clearer, but I wanted you to
                            know how my mind is working as soon as possible.</p>

                            decided to devalue to $2.40 or 14.3 percent. Deming then listed
                            countries which his understanding would hold their exchange rates in
                            event of U.K. devaluation as follows: U.S., Common Market countries
                            (although France had indicated might also move if hurt too much),
                            Sweden, Norway, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland. Deming indicated Denmark
                            would follow U.K. and probably Spain and Austria. He did not know about
                            Australia but Armstrong felt they would hold, although he could not be
                            sure. Deming said Kashiwagi had said Japan's rate would be
                            tied to that of the dollar.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said Maude of U.K.
                            Emb Washington had informed Secy Fowler of move Friday afternoon, London
                            time, and Amb Deane had called on Pres Johnson to inform him.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">No record of these conversations was found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said had informed
                            Schweitzer at <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> that U.K. would
                            request $1.4 billion stand-by from <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said Schweitzer
                            said he would at 9 AM inform Executive Directors of special meeting and
                            give them paper on proposed devaluation at same time and convene meeting
                            to discuss it at 11 AM. Schweitzer estimated would take Board three
                            hours to discuss, thus not have decision before 2 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, Washington time, 7 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            London time. Schweitzer was sending Fund mission led by Goode. Armstrong
                            said Callaghan had telephone conversation with Fowler at about 3:30
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> London time on Friday but was not
                            clear whether Fowler had been informed at that time. Since telephone
                            line not secure, discussion had been on very guarded terms and Callaghan
                            not clear on Fowler's understanding of some points made in
                            the conversation. Schweitzer informed British it could be end of
                            following week before stand-by credit could be granted, thus <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said U.K. would need a large
                            reflow of short-term funds which had gone out Thursday and Friday or
                            short-term help from major countries.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0624"/>
                        <p>3. Deming stated major countries had come to him in Paris on Thursday and
                            Friday volunteering short-term credits to U.K. which along with U.S.
                            contribution totalled some 13.75 billion dollars. Deming said these
                            offers had been extended on assumption of no devaluation, thus he could
                            not be sure how many would still be available, but he thought most if
                            not all would be.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said U.K. tentatively
                            estimated devaluation would improve <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss>
                            by pounds 500 million, although this somewhat hasty estimate which would
                            have to be refined. This improvement would not become fully effective
                            until end 1968 or beginning 1969 since effect on exports could not be
                            immediate. U.K. had forecast large <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss>
                            deficit for 1968 without devaluation and <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> in next few months would still be in deficit. He said
                            for near term they now relying on large reflux of capital.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> gave accompanying
                            govt program as follows: reduction in govt expenditures of pounds 400
                            million of which pounds 100 million defense, 100 million abolition
                            export rebate (which <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName>
                            was sure would please U.S.), 100 million abolition set premium payments,
                            100 million reduction other govt expenditures mostly investment
                            expenditures by nationalized industries; raise bank rate to 8 percent;
                            credit squeeze with virtual ban on personal loans for consumption and
                            reduction in bank lending ceiling from 105 percent to 100 percent with
                            exemption for export credits; increase in corporate tax of 2-1/2
                            percent, increase in heavy fuel oil duty of one penny per gallon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said this would
                            take out from home resources pounds 500 million by end 1968 or beginning
                            1969. This would offset inflationary impact of anticipated 500 million
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> gain which was net of gross gain
                            of 800-850 on exports partially offset by 300-350 deflationary effect
                            from imports.</p>
                        <p>6. Governor O'Brien of <gloss target="#t_BOE1">BOE</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">Bank of England.</note>
                            who had been called earlier by <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName>, joined the meeting. Deming repeated for
                            O'Brien his assessment of countries which would hold rate and
                            gave O'Brien list of countries who had offered credits
                            totalling some $1375 million. O'Brien said
                            “we” had felt U.K.'s short-term
                            indebtedness already quite enough and felt they should not take on any
                            more (this was in regard to defending old parity, not in new
                            circumstances). O'Brien computed total short-term help now
                            available at $3275 million, including 1375 bilateral credits as reported
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFL1">Deming</persName>, 1400 from <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> stand-by, and 500 from U.K. dollar
                            portfolio. O'Brien said he felt these countries should now
                            come to him rather than he going to them, and he hoped to be taking <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0625"/>telephone calls from them on
                            Sunday. He said U.K. would declare bank holiday on Monday.</p>
                        <p>7. Discussion then reverted to timing of announcements. U.K. tentatively
                            planning to make announcement at 9:30 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            Saturday but would much prefer to make it earlier if possible. However,
                            must wait for <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> Executive
                            Directors' decision which Schweitzer said could not come
                            before 7 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> London time and possibly not
                            before 8 <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> London time. Deming
                            questioned need for such long period deliberation in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and thought timing could be pushed up.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> said earlier
                            announcement would be much better for press and TV coverage in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. It was also tentatively agreed with U.S.
                            Treasury that Secy Fowler would make announcement at 6 PM Washington
                                time.<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">For text, released November 19,

                            In any event, however, U.K. would have to sustain selling pressure from
                            Middle East markets which open on Saturday. U.K. would inform European
                            countries of decision just before <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            meeting and <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> felt sure
                            could not avoid some leak getting to Middle East countries. However,
                            they were resigned to these losses and since Middle East banks had
                            limitations on amount of dollar holdings, losses would be limited.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_AWC1">Armstrong</persName> and
                            O'Brien expressed gratitude to Deming for his efforts and for
                            what he had reported to them. They also expressed their gratitude for
                            U.S. Govt's cooperation through entire crisis period and
                            Fowler's attitude, who as reported by U.K. Embassy
                            Washington, received news “without animosity.”</p>

                            domestic political position has been so eroded that it is impossible to

                            him at this time nothing more than a sympathetic hearing, and say he
                            will be glad to discuss the program when it has been definitely settled

                        <p>4964. Subj: New <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense cuts.</p>
                        <p>1. Healey invited PolMil Counselor to call at his office this afternoon
                            to discuss subject of new defense cuts, particularly in light of massive
                            press speculation on fate of F-111 contract. When PolMil Counselor
                            arrived Healey apologized that he had to rush off to special Cabinet
                            session. He asked Broadbent (his office Chief of Staff) who he said was
                            privy to his thinking to review situation on his behalf.</p>
                        <p>2. Broadbent said that Healey was fighting hard in Cabinet sessions on
                            budget reductions, generally taking line that he had already <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0627"/>“done his stuff”
                            in past budget cuts, while civil depts had not. Now it was time for them
                            to show “color of their money.” There was no
                            reason why it was always Defense's “sacred
                            cows” that had to be gored. This line, on which Healey had
                            allies, was having some effect, as was Healey's other basic
                            pro position, i.e. that Cabinet, and especially Political Dept, had to
                            make decisions on what commitments <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            would relinquish before <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> can get down
                            to decisions on specific changes in structure, equipment and
                            deployments. Broadbent said that how long Healey could sustain this line
                            was “matter of speculation.” Timing was such in
                            this crash exercise that decisions were perforce focussed on broad
                            political intentions.</p>
                        <p>3. It seemed generally accepted that there was little that could be done
                            to save money on defense budget in 1968-69. There was not much to be
                            saved even in 1969-70. Nevertheless F-111 project is one that seems to
                            attract attention as most beguiling area for cut, whether it makes sense
                            in terms of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> capabilities for
                            fulfilling its commitments or not.</p>
                        <p>4. Healey has taken same line in Cabinet as he has with press, i.e. that
                            F-111 is a form of military capability that it is right and valid for
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to offer within framework its
                            alliances. He has stressed its utility in Europe and its importance for
                            rapid reinforcement capability abroad. He has also stressed value of
                            offset and industrial advantage it brings <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Healey felt, according to Broadbent, that US could be helpful to him
                            in this fight, if we desired, by “very discreetly”
                            taking hard line on consequences cancellation in our discussions this
                            subject with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> officials and reporters.
                            We could stress the highly favorable price to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of aircraft and concessions we have made on offset
                            arrangement, playing up our “unfathomable
                            generosity.” This would help undo some of the <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Douglas-Home</persName> line (London 4960).<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">Telegram 4960 from London, December 21,
                                reported on press coverage of the F-111 cancellation. (Ibid., DEF 12
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>)</note> We could also stress
                            our conviction that F-111 represents a capability that it makes sense
                            for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to retain both in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context and worldwide.</p>
                        <p>6. PolMil Counselor pointed out that this would be fine if Healey won the
                            day, but could make a turn around difficult if British were to come to
                            us within a week or so and ask for soft terms on cancellation. Broadbent
                            admitted this would be the case but stressed Healey's
                            determination to stand pat on entire package of 50 aircraft. He said he
                            did not rule out, “at the breaking point,”
                            Healey's being willing to be forced down to 40-45 aircraft
                            but thought it would make no sense to go below this.</p>
                        <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>7. In summary, Broadbent hoped we would be willing to stress how far we
                            have gone to help <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in view value of
                            F-111 to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in other theatres.
                            (Broadbent said we might make point, as Healey is doing, that if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> does not have F-111, France will be only
                            other country on continent with long-range strike-recce capability.) To
                            extent this could be done without cancelling out possibility reduction
                            in size of aircraft buy so much the better.</p>
                        <p>8. Broadbent said that so far Healey had had surprisingly sympathetic
                            response from Labor backbench. Finally Broadbent said Healey wished him
                            to make once more the point that early response to his request to Nitze
                            to increase offset by $150 million would materially help him in holding
                            the line.<note n="3" xml:id="d283fn3">The response was transmitted in
                                telegram 4860 from London, December 15. It provided a list of
                                British weapons systems that might constitute an offset to costs of

                            question is academic. Healey is now asking us to give him some discreet
                            help in his internal battle. If in fact US attaches importance to
                            preservation of F-111 program and considers retention of this capability
                            by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is important to us, as Embassy
                            believes it should be, it would be fully feasible for Embassy and

                        <p>Dear Harold:</p>
                        <p>We are at the end of a difficult year, and both our countries have much
                            unfinished business to carry forward. It is encouraging to recall,
                            nonetheless, that it has been a year in which our close consultation and
                            collaboration have helped produce a number of memorable
                            achievements—the maintenance of security arrangements in
                            Europe, the agreement of the new reserve unit in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the completion of the Kennedy Round,
                            to recall a few. We are not yet out of the woods in the Middle East, but
                            we have certainly made progress, with the passage of your Resolution in
                            the Security Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">Security Council
                                Resolution 242 (1967), adopted November 22.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We can take heart also from the success we have had through our joint
                            efforts and through the cooperation of the other financial powers in
                            meeting the critical problems of November and December and in restoring
                            a sense of confidence and order to the world's financial
                            system.</p>
                        <p>The speculative fever of these weeks has severely tested our methods of
                            cooperating on economic problems; but, we have continued to work
                            together effectively in a financial world suddenly beset by fear and
                            disorder. We have, thus far, met and repelled a serious threat to the
                            foundations of the international monetary system, which, in turn, could
                            also have undone the accomplishments of the Kennedy Round and the unity
                            of the system of international commerce.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the agreements at London and Rio on a plan to supplement
                            existing reserve assets are a further reason for solid satisfaction, as
                            we look to the longer future.</p>
                        <p>In both of these achievements—the long-range improvement of
                            our international monetary system and the recent defense of the existing
                                system—<persName corresp="#p_CJ2">James
                                Callaghan</persName> at the Treasury and Leslie O'Brien
                            at the Bank of England have played important and indeed vital roles. I
                            know that they have contributed much to the recent efforts to preserve
                            order in the gold and foreign exchange markets. I am reassured by our
                            mutual determination to exert a constructive force in the world
                            financial system. This I know reflects a clear common understanding of
                            the importance of international monetary cooperation in creating that
                            environment <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0630"/>of safety and
                            opportunity which is required for the continued growth and stability of
                            our nation's economies.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we, as well as our trading partners, have been concerned
                            about the balance of payments position of the United States. This
                            concern has been increased by the events of recent weeks. As a result, I
                            am announcing on January 1, 1968, a new and vastly strengthened program
                            to reduce our deficit and guarantee the continued viability of the
                            international monetary system.<note n="3" xml:id="d284fn3">For text, see
                                Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B.
                                Johnson, 1968-69, Book I, pp. 8-13.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the program, I will press for tax increase to restrain excessive
                            demand in the United States and to reduce our budget deficit to
                            manageable proportions. I hope that this bill will soon become law.
                            This, in itself, should be a helpful factor in our balance of payments
                            and should demonstrate to the world that we will keep our own economic
                            house in order. And the Federal Reserve has already made clear its
                            determination to use monetary policy to this end.</p>
                        <p>But much more needs to be done; and we propose to do much more. Our
                            balance of payments actions are designed to improve both our current and
                            our capital accounts.</p>
                        <p>These actions will be painful to the United States and, to some degree,
                            to our international partners. They are designed to avoid as far as
                            possible adverse effects on the developing areas of the world. We hope
                            they will result more in the reduction of surpluses than in the shift or
                            increase of deficits. And we have kept very much in mind the views of
                            other countries and the international economic institutions.</p>
                        <p>In this effort we wish to proceed within the spirit and the letter of the
                            recent resolution of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Ministerial Council that the adjustment of the American deficit and the
                            European surplus is a matter of common concern to be handled
                            cooperatively. Surpluses in international payments are the mirror image
                            of deficits. Thus, both surplus and deficit countries must strive to
                            reach balance and act cooperatively to this end. This is no less true in
                            the 1960's than it was in the late 1940's and
                            '50's, when we carried the responsibilities of a
                            surplus nation. This concept was definitively developed by our best
                            economic and financial experts in a carefully prepared <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> report on “The Adjustment
                            Process” in August 1966.</p>
                        <p>Our deficits have been the net result of a current account surplus,
                            including a trade surplus, inadequate to support foreign exchange costs
                            of our external capital flows, foreign aid programs, and military
                            expenditures for the common defense. During the period of the
                            “Dollar <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0631"/>Gap”, these deficits helped redistribute the
                            world's monetary reserves—the time has come, we
                            all agree, to bring them to an end.</p>
                        <p>As we see the problem, we need to act to improve our current account,
                            reduce capital outflows, and neutralize more fully our net foreign
                            exchange expenditures in the common defense. Our new program is designed
                            to move us strongly towards equilibrium. But full success will require
                            the understanding and cooperation of our partners. It seems axiomatic to
                            us, and basic to our view of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Resolution, that those in strong reserve positions, or in surplus,
                            should avoid actions that increase surpluses, should not take
                            off-setting action to preserve their surpluses—indeed, that
                            it will be necessary for them to take positive action to move toward
                            balance. Otherwise, the only result will be to shift the adjustment
                            burden to those who can least bear it or to make it more difficult for
                            us to achieve balance. In our judgment—and, I believe, in
                            your judgment—it is important for the United States to move
                            decisively toward balance with the last possible dislocation to the
                            world's system of trade and finance. Our mutual security and
                            collective well-being, which rest upon the continuing strength and unity
                            of the international economic system, are at stake.</p>
                        <p>It is against these fundamental objectives, which I am sure are common
                            objectives, that I hope you and your Government will judge our new and
                            strengthened balance of payments program. I have asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to call on you to
                            explain our new program more fully. I have also asked Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> to visit with you
                            in London to review further both this program and the entire scope of
                            our mutual cooperation. I trust you and your key ministers will support
                            this program and, thereby, help preserve confidence in the system we
                            have built so diligently together over the past twenty years. I am
                            looking forward to seeing you in February.</p>

                        <p>“I am deeply disturbed by information which has just reached
                            me to the effect that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> may be

                            know, we attach very high importance to the maintenance of the British
                            position in the Persian Gulf for the indefinite future. We welcomed the
                            repositioning of some of your forces there from Aden last year as an

                            long. While economies can no doubt be made, I would earnestly hope that
                            when we meet next week <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> will not have
                            taken any irrevocable decisions. In our view, fixing of specific

                            Gore-Booth and William Armstrong. I first gave the Prime Minister a
                            run-down on our visits around the continent. They were particularly
                            interested in French reaction and whether any of the other countries had
                            begun to make estimates of the effects of our measures. Prime Minister
                            reiterated the position taken by Roy Jenkins at our meeting last Tuesday
                            of complete understanding and support for the President's
                                program.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">The meeting took place on
                                January 2. According to a January 2 entry in the Bruce Diaries:
                                    “<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>,
                                at times assisted by Deming, explained at length what we hoped to
                                achieve by the proposed measures. Roy Jenkins replied, saying he
                                thoroughly understood the reasons for what we were doing, and,
                                although our actions would have a harmful effect on the British
                                economy, he did not propose to make any complaint about
                                them.” (Department of State, Bruce Diaries: Lot 64 D
                                327)</note> I emphasized that these measures were taken in a
                            political context and that the President was very anxious to be able to
                            subtract the balance of payments argument from those who would, for
                            other reasons, wish to advocate either troop withdrawals or
                            protectionist measures.</p>
                        <p>2. While recognizing that these political forces were at work, the Prime
                            Minister did express concern about any measures in the trade field and
                            commented that the introduction of the border tax by the United States
                            could lead to consequences on world trading patterns. He said he did not
                            wish to over-dramatize this situation but clearly implied that it would
                            be extremely difficult for the British to go forward with their
                            elimination of export rebates at a time when the United States was
                            introducing such a measure. He inquired whether it might not be
                            possible, as it was in the British system, to leave discretionary
                            measures in the hands of the President while discussions were proceeding
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> about the TVA. The Prime
                            Minister also pointed out that although we might be successful in
                            obtaining the agreement of the major world trading powers to stand still
                            for our border tax measures at this time, we might very well find that
                            the next country to get into trouble would use this method and perhaps
                            even more protectionist devices in its
                            “package.”</p>
                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0634"/>
                        <p>3. In discussing our talks in Bonn and the reactions to our pleas for
                            neutralization of balance of payments effects of troop stationing, Prime
                            Minister said that it was absolutely essential for Britain to obtain one
                            hundred million pounds offset agreement by April 1st when the current
                            agreement runs out. He said that the Germans had not yet been able to
                            talk to them because they had not reached agreement on their purchase
                            plans because of internal budget difficulties. It looked now as though
                            these talks could not begin yet for some time. The Prime Minister made
                            the flat statement that without such an offset, given all the other
                            drastic measures he has had to take and the situation in the
                            Parliamentary Labor Party, he could not defend the maintenance of troops
                            in Germany. He said that they would have to make this clear to the
                            Germans. He recognized that any breakdown in British arrangements with
                            the Germans necessitating such a withdrawal could very well fuel the
                            very forces the President was opposing in the United States and
                            therefore he would make every effort to reach an agreement with the
                            Germans. He was not insisting that payments under an offset agreement be
                            received immediately, but would be content with assurance that payments
                            would in time be received sufficient to completely offset <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military expenditures after April 1.</p>
                        <p>4. In discussing this problem Prime Minister said that recent Cabinet
                            discussions had been leading in the direction of decisions to put the
                            greatest stress on British military presence in Europe. He knew that
                            this gave us problems and mentioned the fact that the Secretary had sent
                            a letter to <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George Brown</persName> today on
                            the Persian Gulf. I said that this did give us concern but felt in the
                            context of this discussion I should not go any further. (In any case
                                <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George Brown</persName> will be
                            discussing this with you next week.)</p>
                        <p>5. As we were leaving Prime Minister said he was very much looking
                            forward to seeing the President next month in Washington and assumed he
                            could continue this conversation there. We would then have a better idea
                            of what we were going to do.</p>

                                Healey's optimism about maintaining his position in
                                Cabinet, I think it impossible at present to predict what compromise
                                may finally be reached.” (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>5336. Subj: Healey views on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> defense
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>1. Denis Healey this morning asked Embassy PolMil Counselor to come to
                            his office for private chat on current status British defense cut
                            decisions. Discussion, which lasted an hour, was extremely frank and far
                            ranging. Healey's comments made it quite clear that he was
                            bitter about role PriMin had played but that he, Brown,
                            Thomson—at times assisted by Callaghan—had
                            nevertheless prevailed in assuring relatively rational approach to
                            defense cuts.</p>
                        <p>2. Prime reason for Healey's invitation to discussion became
                            immediately apparent however. He said it was important for Secretary and
                            Wash officials with whom <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George
                                Brown</persName> would be talking this week to know that there was
                            “absolutely no question of a choice between chopping the
                            F-111 and our staying East of Suez.” It will do no good for
                            Sec to suggest that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> pull out of F-111
                            deal and change decision on Singapore/Malaysia withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>3. While he did not say so explicitly, way he put matter indicated that
                            he has some indication that this is possible proposal from Sec and that
                            this will jeopardize his so far successful fight to save F-111, without
                            changing East of Suez decision. EmbOff assumed from tenor
                            Healey's remarks also that he had discussed with Brown his
                            making this pitch to Embassy.</p>
                        <p>4. Healey then went on to say that he felt much more encouraged about
                            present situation than he could have thought possible a month ago. In
                            early Dec things looked “pretty grim” and he was
                            sure that he would have to resign before long since he would be forced
                            to accept “lunatic” Cabinet judgments on series of
                            irrational defense cuts which would leave Britain with no real
                            capability even in Europe. By making common cause with <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> and Thomson and <persName corresp="#p_CJ2">Callaghan</persName>, however, he had succeeded in
                            getting firm Cabinet agreement that if more cuts were to be made they
                            had to be preceded by and related to cuts in commitments, and that this
                            was matter for decision by entire Cabinet including <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0636"/>particularly “political
                            departments.” At some risk he had given Sunday Times
                            interview (A-2146)<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">Dated January 9.
                                (Ibid.)</note> which nailed down this point for record.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to EmbOff questioning Healey gave series of frank comments
                            on status of various issues. Following are highlights:</p>
                        <p>A. Defense</p>
                        <p>Cut decision emerging from last Thursday's Cabinet discussion,
                            where “big majority” was in favor of almost
                            immediate Singapore/Malaysia and Gulf pull-out, had been to leave
                            Singapore/Malaysia finally on 31 March 1971 and to be out of Gulf
                            “before” that date. (From another source, Embassy
                            learned this could be any time during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            70-71.) He and <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George Brown</persName> had
                            argued strongly for an additional year in Singapore/Malaysia and it was
                            agreed that “the two Georges” would have a right
                            to raise the issue this coming Friday or Saturday in the light of their
                            consultations in Far East and Wash. It is certain, Healey said, that
                            they would do so. Lee Kuan Yew had performed brilliantly yesterday and
                            had strengthened Thomson's hand in seeking another look. He
                            hoped Australians would do as well, but was less hopeful. He thought Lee
                            had slightly overdone, however, in his threats about
                            “Japanese takeover.” What Healey was indirectly
                            urging was that Sec also concentrate on timing issue (since the only
                            thing open was timing) in his talks with Brown. He thought that decision
                            to extend by another year withdrawal date was still a possibility.</p>
                        <p>Healey said he was somewhat surprised by Secretary's message
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> on Gulf since he would
                            have assumed that as between two places US interests were much more
                            involved in prolongation <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence in
                            Far East. Healey said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would warn
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> that its force declarations
                            would be reduced to “derisory level” in terms of
                            numbers and forces but that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not
                            pull out of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or raise membership
                            as issue in view of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>'s
                            importance to US as cover for justifying US presence in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>B. Persian Gulf. Healey said he had himself been against last
                            year's Brit decision to build up at Sharjah and Bahrein on
                            grounds it made neither military nor political sense. Now all money
                            which had been poured in would be wasted. While he continued to believe
                            that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces in area were a
                            contribution to stability (in terms of possible Iraq-Kuwait conflict or
                            trouble between Shah and Faisal over Bahrein, or among Trucial States)
                            he thought these conflicts could be contained diplomatically. It was
                            clear that Britain would have had to get out of Gulf by 1975 at any
                            rate. In light of this it was better to go sooner rather than later, by
                            which time [garble] situations as in Aden might have <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0637"/>been created. Brown and he both thought
                            that situation in Gulf certain to be eroded in due course, that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interests served by maintaining status
                            quo as long as possible but that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            presence could be an irritant as well as inhibitor of trouble and it was
                            a nice judgment in which direction they would operate most strongly. He
                            thought that leaving in less than two years would be risky but his
                            comments seemed to indicate he would prefer to use whatever influence he
                            had in prolonging <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> presence in
                            Singapore/Malaysia rather than in Gulf and that ordinarily he would have
                            assumed US would see it same way. If <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            was going to leave, and this decision was irreversible, it was likely to
                            be harmful rather than helpful to prolong Brit Gulf presence beyond
                            1970-1971. He said at least one <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> rep on
                            spot he had recently talked with seemed to feel same way he did about
                            this.</p>
                        <p>C. F-111. He said he “nearly won” this battle last
                            week, but that <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had surprisingly
                            “led the pack” against it; <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> seemed to consider it a good sacrificial goat.
                            Nevertheless Healey now felt relatively optimistic about his ability to
                            keep whole order of 50 aircraft but said that he would be willing to
                            sacrifice 10 if this was necessary to get an overall rational package of
                            defense cuts. EmbOff raised question of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> commitment and Canberras on
                            Cyprus. Healey said that as Canberras phase out F-111's would
                            be helpful in maintaining this commitment, which there was no present
                            intention to cut. On balance he felt reduction of order to 40 (if any
                            reduction necessary) would be “least damaging,”
                            that he expected this matter would be resolved within another 36 hours
                            and that he was not at all unconfident about keeping all 50, at the
                            moment at least. He said Wash talks which indicated <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could keep Jetstream order, present
                            offset arrangements, (including the extra $100 million if cut was no
                            more than 15), were helpful. EmbOff noted he had understood that extra
                            $100 million could not be kept if order were cut to this extent. Healey
                            said he was gratified at US emphasis that offset was related to total
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> aircraft buy and not just to F-111
                            program.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss>. Healey said both he and the
                            Foreign Office were determined to avoid any further drawdown of the
                                <gloss target="#t_BAOR1">BAOR</gloss> either this year or next.
                            However, the offset talks, when they came about, would have a heavy
                            influence on whether they could prevail. He said Jenkins would be more
                            help than Callaghan had been in this area. Also, what the US and the
                            Germans themselves did would also bear on British ability to hold the
                            line, and he feared that the US would be pressed to announce sometime
                            next fall a further “redevelopment” of its own
                            forces. (He said he felt 1970 would be too soon for another reduction.)
                            Also the Dutch Defense Minister told him he could not hold the line on
                            Dutch forces. Therefore this was still likely to be a troublesome
                            area.</p>
                        <p>E. Miscellaneous. Healey said that Navy Phantoms were too far along to
                            cancel and were “so bloody expensive” that no one
                            else would <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0638"/>buy them. They would
                            probably have to be repainted and turned over to the RAF. He thought
                            there would be some reduction in total Phantom buy but evaluations had
                            not yet been completed. He said present situation made any <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> only or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> project to replace
                            AFVG “out of the question.” Some kind of
                            cooperative program with us, however, could not be ruled out. He would
                            probably procrastinate by keeping present VG design team going for
                            another year. He also said he was meeting with Messmer this afternoon
                            and would try to have it out re French intentions on building their own
                            VG. He did not think French would do more than build a prototype in view
                            defense budget problems arising from de Gaulle's trying to do
                            a little bit of everything in the nuclear field.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: EmbOff said he had no indications from
                            Wash about any proposal for a tradeoff such as Healey feared between
                            F-111 and East of Suez. EmbOff however promised to bring his comments as
                            reported above to Wash's immediate attention. Healey
                            obviously has strong personal stake in continuation of F-111, feels he
                            has matter under relatively good control and was worried that some
                            proposal along these lines from Sec to Brown would upset the applecart.
                            He was also clearly urging us to weigh in with Brown in favor of
                            lengthening by one year present withdrawal deadline from
                            Singapore/Malaysia. His judgment appears to be that with US pressure
                            along side of that which is already coming from Singapore and Kuala
                            Lumpur there is better than even chance of Healey, Brown and company
                            prevailing on this in renewed Cabinet discussion Friday or Saturday.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said that
                            Britain had lost the battle to avoid devaluation—a matter on
                            which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was so
                            understanding—because they had been trying to do too much at
                            home and abroad with too slender resources. Since devaluation the
                            Government had been obliged to consider what could be done to free a
                            considerable part of its resources for greater exports as well as to
                            consider what cuts in spending must be made to assure confidence and to
                            avoid further devaluation. The conclusion of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was that this required a switch of 1 billion pounds,
                            including substantial cuts in spending at home. This was all
                            particularly unpalatable because it involved an attack on some cherished
                            social programs, such as health and educational services. It would also
                            involve a mammoth rise in taxation as well as a reduction in overseas
                            spending. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> did not want to attack the
                            aid program; this would be counter productive. Therefore, Brown said,
                            they were forced again to look at defense expenditures overseas. The
                            Ministry of Defence had taken the view that they had made all the
                            possible hardware and manpower cuts as long as the present commitments
                                remained.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">During a subsequent part of
                                the discussion, Brown, in reply to a question from Assistant
                                Secretary Leddy, stated: “They had not decided in the
                                same firm was as they had made other decisions what to do about the
                                F-111's.” A memorandum of this portion of the
                                conversation is in the National Archives and Records Administration,
                                    <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1967-69, DEF
                                12-5 <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</note> Therefore they have
                            had to look again at the commitments implied in the July 1967
                            decisions.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0640"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said that they had come to
                            the following conclusions: first, they must accelerate the rundown in
                            the Far East. This meant there would be no bases on mainland Asia by
                            March 31, 1971, instead of by the mid-1970's. They must drop
                            the idea of maintaining (after withdrawal) special capabilities in that
                            area such as an amphibious force. They would however have a general
                            capability in Europe from which troops would be available for use
                            anywhere. Second, they must also leave the Persian Gulf by the same
                            time. This was dictated by (a) savings, although admittedly they would
                            not be very great, and (b) the decision about the Far East which meant
                            there would be no carriers or bases available to support or relieve the
                            Persian Gulf after that date.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> went on to say that it was
                            their intention to “renegotiate” the
                            Anglo-Malaysian Agreement, but not to renounce it. They would remain in
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, but obviously when the troops ran
                            down the force declarations under SEATO would have no content. Hong Kong
                            would be the only exception to this general policy: they propose to
                            maintain and retain their position there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> concluded these were the firm views of his
                            colleagues subject to the reports presented to the Cabinet this coming
                            weekend by George Thomson, Goronwy Roberts and <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> following their visits to the Far
                            East, Middle East and the U.S. respectively.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had several observations to make. At the outset he
                            wanted to remind the Foreign Secretary that, as he had a reputation for
                            being soft spoken, he wished <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName>
                            would add several decibels when he conveyed these views to the Cabinet.
                            The Secretary was profoundly dismayed by the proposed withdrawal from
                            Southeast Asia and the Persian Gulf, and he was particularly disturbed
                            by the intention to announce these decisions. Both areas were in a high
                            state of turmoil and free world interests were in jeopardy. The
                            Secretary said his advice, more succinctly, was “be
                            Britain.” This step would have profound and detrimental
                            implications for the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. The
                            Secretary said he would dismiss as of “no
                            consequence” the idea that forces at home could support
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. The pressures behind these moves
                            would make it impossible for British soldiers to leave British
                            shores.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if, pending its entry in Europe, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> dropped back to a Little England he could
                            not help but feel that this would generate a descending spiral across
                            the board. It would have a profound effect on the economic and financial
                            relations with these countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. By
                            consulting their fears rather than their confidence, the British would
                            bring about the very thing they were struggling against. This was an
                            alarming development. The Secretary thought that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> needed to be concerned with developments elsewhere,
                            such as what would the Malaysians think the <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0641"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would do if their
                            remote islands came under attack. When <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> announced last July that they would leave the Far East
                            by the mid-1970's, the U.S. Government had understood this
                            would be subject to peace in the area, that the situation would be under
                            review and that there would be no pull-out until there was stability in
                            the area. There is no stability in the area yet although there has been
                            some progress, for example, in <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s role vis-á-vis Indonesia. He said
                            that many Americans were essentially isolationists, but since 1945 the
                            US has had 300,000 casualties in the effort to maintain peace around the
                            world. The British had set the example and had helped us make decisions
                            of will in World War II and in the post-war period. The Secretary said
                            he was disturbed when the teacher abandoned the field. Americans would
                            ask if no one else was interested, why should they be. Authentic
                            isolation was growing in the US because of the growing feeling that
                            Americans were carrying the problem alone. General de Gaulle had
                            contributed to this, but if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> went
                            down the trail of deliberate withdrawal the effects would be
                            profound.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as he looked at the foreign exchange costs of
                            British presence in the Persian Gulf, i.e. approximately 12 million
                            pounds per year, he thought these costs would be multiplied if the
                            governments there decided there was no point in staying with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. In the Far East, Malaysia and Singapore,
                            Australia and New Zealand would look elsewhere, and the direct economic
                            impact would be greater than the cuts.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said that
                            he had hoped to make clear that the Persian Gulf decision was not based
                            on the minor saving that might result, but that it was a logical outcome
                            of the major decision to withdraw from the Far East. He said it was not
                            true to say the Persian Gulf was in a state of unrest. At the moment, it
                            was more stable than it had been for a long time and relations between
                            major parties were as good as ever. The likelihood of unrest seemed
                            minimal at this moment. As regards the Far East, Brown said that the
                            July 1967 decision had never been intended to mean that they would
                            review the basic decision to leave. They had always considered, even if
                            it had remained unstated, that the reference to stability in the area
                            was itself confined to a 1973-77 time frame.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary said that he wished to note also that this did not
                            represent a choice between defense cuts or cuts in social services, but
                            rather that there would also be very substantial cuts in their home
                            programs. In fact, they would derive very little short-term benefit from
                            the cuts in their external programs. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            could not keep forces overseas in face of a sick economy at home which
                            was unable to sustain these forces. The inescapable facts were that
                            their economy must be strong if they were to play any part in world
                            affairs. This did not reflect a desire to withdraw to a Little
                            England.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not feel as comfortable about the Middle East
                            as did Foreign Secretary Brown. Iran and Saudi Arabia were <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0642"/>worried; and both Israel and the Arabs
                            were concerned about Soviet penetration of the Middle East. At <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> it had been agreed that there would
                            be further talks about Soviet penetration in the Middle East. The
                            Secretary thought that some discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on these British intentions would have been
                            appropriate if not obligatory. The Secretary asked if they had
                            considered whether the prospects of improved trade figures were relevant
                            to these decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said the economic
                            ministers thought the adverse consequences of devaluation would be felt
                            first, such as in the increased cost of imports; the improvement in
                            exports would not show until around 1969-70. This would depend on the
                            availability of resources at home, the development of substitutes for
                            imports, on establishing confidence in the pound and in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s internal policies, as well
                            as British determination to carry these out. Brown said it was hard to
                            fault these assumptions and recommendations. In reply to the
                            Secretary's question as to whether there had been an
                            authentic national debate on these questions, <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said he thought the majority view was that they
                            were trying to do too much, that they were carrying more than their
                            share of the peacekeeping burden, and in favor of cutting their overseas
                            commitments. There would be a debate in Parliament next week but there
                            was no doubt that support for ending their Far East commitments ran
                            through the left, center, and right wings of the Labor Party. He added
                            that it was generally felt that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was
                            struggling with a burden which their economic competitors did not
                            share.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> if
                            the pullout from the Persian Gulf was wiser than an equivalent reduction
                            in foreign aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said he
                            opposed a reduction in foreign aid. In fact, one of the results of these
                            decisions was that the aid program would go up. For example, there would
                            be the need to provide compensatory assistance to Singapore and
                            Malaysia. As for the Persian Gulf, Brown said <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s continuing presence was more divisive than
                            unitary; withdrawal was important for its own sake and this was the
                            right moment for it. The Foreign Secretary reiterated that they could
                            not stay in the Persian Gulf once they were rid of the Far East bases.
                            They believed they could only get hardware savings out of such decisions
                            as cutting the carrier force. For example, they will not refit a third
                            carrier; this will save 30 million pounds. If there is no carrier force
                            beyond '72 which is capable of returning people and equipment
                            everyone could conclude that they must come out of the area. He thought
                            they would provide support via aircraft and, if necessary, they could
                            make arrangements to obtain the necessary transport planes. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said they did not want to maintain
                            ships against theoretical possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> asked if
                            it was necessary to be so explicit about the withdrawals. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said that his colleagues believed
                                <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0643"/>that it was necessary to be
                            clear cut as there would be leaks. Furthermore, if they followed this
                            timetable, they must stop the buildup in Bahrain and Sharjah. The moment
                            that buildup stopped the basic decision would become self-evident. They
                            would also be accused of vacillation if they did not make a clear cut
                            decision, and this reduced the risk of an Aden type situation. A
                            reduction not accompanied by an announcement would help the extremist
                            forces. Brown said there had been varied reactions out of the Middle
                            East, but the most serious governments have known what was coming. They
                            would settle down to consider other arrangements. This was also an
                            argument for being precise. The time would come when <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would not be the policeman; it should
                            help these governments concentrate on what they must do for themselves
                            in the security field.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s departure would eliminate
                            any contribution it could make to deterrents such as in Malaysia
                            vis-á-vis Indonesia. The U.S. could not pick up these
                            responsibilities; the resulting gap would be contrary to free world
                            interests. Brown said there was no good reason why Malaysia, Singapore,
                            Australia, New Zealand and even the U.S. should not get together to
                            discuss how to fill that gap; there was no reason why it should be
                            filled by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>. The Secretary said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was not in a position to advise as it
                            could not take on any more in Southeast Asia; our current costs were too
                            high. He asked what would be said at the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> meeting in April. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> replied that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>'s main contribution to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> was the equipment on Cyprus and no changes were
                            contemplated there. As for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, he
                            reiterated that the declaration covers the forces in the area but that
                            when there were no forces nothing could be declared. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would remain a member of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>; any forces would come out of their
                            general capability. This obligation was not the same as that under
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if they
                            contemplated a demobilization of forces. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> replied affirmatively, saying they intended a
                            rundown in their army, navy and airforce. While the troops stationed in
                            Europe would be available to go anywhere, they would need to make a
                            choice of flareups occurred in a number of places simultaneously. He
                            assumed <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intended some demobilization
                            of its own after Viet-Nam. The Secretary said the latter assumption was
                            correct, but the U.S. would be able to move back quickly from various
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he deduced from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName>'s remarks the acrid aroma of a
                            fait-accompli; and presumably what he said would not make much
                            difference. He hoped that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would look
                            hard at the implications of these decisions, adding also that any
                            announcements the British make would elicit strong Congressional
                            reaction. He hoped no action would be taken that would diminish the
                            accomplishments for peace in the post-war period. An announcement such
                            as the <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0644"/>British propose would
                            throw a long shadow far greater than the magnitude of the actions
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> reiterated that these
                            were intentions which had been firmed up before there were meaningful
                            consultations. He had been given the charge to explain the intentions
                            and to report back the Secretary's reactions. In that sense
                            this was not a fait-accompli, but he wished not to leave the Secretary
                            with any doubt of the intention of his colleagues to make final
                            decisions tomorrow and announce them next Tuesday. The Secretary said
                            that what was really important was that this represented a major
                            withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> from world affairs,
                            and it was a catastrophic loss to human society. These decisions
                            involved the highest level of judgment and of instinct about where the
                            human family was going. We were facing a difficult period in world
                            affairs and Britain was saying it would not be there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that, as a government, we were not making choices or
                            indicating preferences between the Far East and the Middle East. We
                            believed our interests were in trouble in both areas if the British took
                            these measures. He also said he had the impression that the need for
                            making an advance announcement was not really related to their
                            operational requirements. Rather, he thought this was relevant to the
                            other cuts they were making. Perhaps they were underestimating their
                            people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> said all
                            governments have this problem; each must assess its own political
                            difficulties. However, these decisions were based on the belief that
                            these were the right things to do, not on political reasons.</p>

                        <p>Dear Harold:</p>
                        <p>I have just learned from Dean <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            of your plans for total British withdrawal from the Far East and the
                            Persian Gulf by 1971.</p>
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0645"/>
                        <p>I know you are close to a final decision and that there is not much time
                            for reconsideration. I also can guess at what soul-searching you and
                            your colleagues have been going through in trying to find the means for
                            restoring health of the British economy and still carrying as much as
                            possible of the financial burdens which you have so courageously borne
                            thus far.</p>
                        <p>This having been said, I cannot conceal from you my deep dismay upon
                            learning this profoundly discouraging news. If these steps are taken,
                            they will be tantamount to British withdrawal from world affairs, with
                            all that means for the future safety and health of the free world. The
                            structure of peace-keeping will be shaken to its foundations. Our own
                            capability and political will could be gravely weakened if we have to
                            man the ramparts all alone.</p>
                        <p>Although the decision must, of course, be your own, I can only wonder if
                            you and all of your associates have taken fully into account the direct
                            and indirect consequences.</p>
                        <p>While the hour is late, I urge you and your colleagues once more to
                            review the alternatives before you take these irrevocable steps. Even a
                            prolongation of your presence in the Far East and the Persian Gulf until
                            other stable arrangements can be put in place would be of help at this
                            very difficult time for all of us.</p>
                        <p>With warmest personal regards,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            during his recent visit, and as I stated in my recent letter to you, the
                            announcement of accelerated British withdrawal both from its Far Eastern
                            bases and from the Persian Gulf would create most serious problems for
                            the United States Government and for the security of the entire free
                            world. Americans will find great difficulty in supporting the idea that
                            we must move in to secure areas which the United Kingdom has
                            abandoned.</p>
                        <p>It has been our hope that a demonstrated ability of United Kingdom
                            military forces speedily to deploy to these areas from its own bases
                            might alleviate somewhat the strong reaction which will inevitably take
                            place. The F-111, because of its range and overall capability, would
                            demonstrate this rapid deployment ability.</p>
                        <p>But if you decide to forego the acquisition of the F-111, everyone here
                            will regard this as a total disengagement from any commitments
                            whatsoever to the security of areas outside Europe and, indeed, to a
                            considerable extent in Europe as well. Moreover, it will be viewed here
                            as a strong indication of British isolation which would be fatal to the
                            chances of cooperation between our countries in the field of defense
                            procurement. Both Dean and Bob made it clear to George <persName corresp="#p_BG1">Brown</persName> that financial penalties will have
                            to be applied if there is a decision to cancel the F-111 contract.
                            Politically, we have no choice. Appreciable as these penalties would be
                            in monetary terms, however, they would be far less serious than the
                            reciprocal actions which in all likelihood would follow. Retention of
                            the present offset arrangements would become out of the question.
                            Pressures for domestic procurement could no longer be resisted. These
                            would almost inescapably lead to complete cancellation of recent awards
                            of military contracts to British firms.</p>
                        <p>But even these severe economic effects would be overshadowed by the
                            foreign policy consequences of an F-111 cancellation. Many in this
                            country, including influential members of Congress, would bring the
                            strongest pressures to bear on us to sacrifice international security
                            interests to ease our present financial problems. Our ability to
                            maintain <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0647"/>substantial forces in
                            Europe, while fighting a difficult and costly war in Southeast Asia,
                            would be greatly endangered.</p>
                        <p>As I indicated in my last letter to you, I recognize fully that a
                            decision on this question is one that the British Government alone can
                            make. I hope that it will do so with full consideration of all the
                            factors involved. And I wanted you to know how important I consider it
                            to be that the United Kingdom and the United States maintain their
                            understanding on the F-111 in all essential respects and continue to at
                            least try to defend freedom in this hectic and unsettled world in which
                            we live.<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">On January 16 “Healey

                        <p>I laid both your messages before my Cabinet colleagues today and they
                            were carefully read before our final deliberations and decisions on the
                            range and extent of the swingeing cuts in public expenditure, at home
                            and overseas, that I shall be announcing to Parliament tomorrow. I
                            should like to say at the outset how grateful I am to you for setting
                            out with such restraint and understanding what I know to be your
                            powerfully-held views on the measures we are having to take.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly tell you how profoundly my colleagues and I regret the
                            necessity for our decisions. As you will see when you receive a copy of
                            my statement—and I will do my best to get this to you as
                            early as possible—some of the decisions we have taken on the
                            home front strike at the very root of principles to which many of us
                            have been dedicated <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0648"/>since we
                            first went into politics. They are bitter decisions for us to have to
                            make; and only our conviction that they are vital in the long-term
                            interests of Britain, and that the British people will accept them as
                            such, has made it possible for us to stomach them.</p>
                        <p>The heavy sacrifices at home would have been pointless without drastic
                            retrenchment abroad. I ask you to believe that this is not, as some
                            journalists and even some Commonwealth statesmen have been saying,
                            simply a matter of party politics—of keeping some kind of
                            “balance” to force the unpleasant home medicine
                            down the throats of our party supporters. Of course politics is involved
                            here—what is politics all about anyway? But this is much
                            wider than party politics—the politics of the nation and the
                            sense of purpose of the British people as a whole are deeply
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>At the time of devaluation, I told you that the British people were sick
                            and tired of being thought willing to eke out a comfortable existence on
                            borrowed money. As your people may have told you, there has been over
                            the past weeks an astonishing assertion of this kind of spirit
                            throughout the nation and irrespective of party. At the root of this is
                            a still rather confused groping for the real role that Britain ought to
                            be playing in the world; and it has been striking to observe, in polls
                            and other tests of public opinion, not only the extent to which people
                            are prepared to accept drastic sacrifice at home but also their demand
                            that we must no longer continue to overstrain our real resources and
                            capabilities in the military field abroad.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean, as you suggest, a British withdrawal from world
                            affairs. Of course there are always, in any country, those who in
                            moments of storm prefer to bury their heads in the sand. But the spirit
                            that has been running through this nation in recent weeks is not that of
                            “Little England.” I believe it to be a blend of
                            exasperation at our inability to weather the successive economic storms
                            of the past twenty years and determination, once and for all, to hew out
                            a new role for Britain in the world at once commensurate with her real
                            resources yet worthy of her past. There is at last a nation-wide
                            realisation that this can not be done on borrowed time and borrowed
                            money.</p>
                        <p>I shall not attempt to list here all the measures which will be set out
                            in my statement tomorrow. But just as you were able to give me brief
                            forewarning of the dramatic steps you felt it necessary to take on New
                            Year's Day to protect even the vast economic strength of the
                            United States, so I wish you to know now the two decisions that are most
                            directly relevant to this country's international posture and
                            thus to our own working relationship; and those to which your two
                            messages were addressed.</p>
                        <p>First, the Far East and the Gulf. As I shall be explaining tomorrow, it
                            is absolutely clear to us that our present political commitments are <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0649"/>too great for the military
                            capability of the forces that we can reasonably afford, if the economy
                            is to be restored quickly and decisively; but without economic strength,
                            we can have no real military credibility. If there is any lesson to be
                            learned from the [illegible] way we have found ourselves obliged to
                            lurch from one defence review to another in recent years, it is that we
                            must now take certain major foreign policy decisions as the prerequisite
                            of economies in our defence expenditure. Put simply, this only amounts
                            to saying that we have to come to terms with our role in the world. And
                            we are confident that if we fully assert our economic strength, we can,
                            by realistic priorities, strengthen this country's real
                            influence and power for peace in the world.</p>
                        <p>This was what underlay the intention, conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_BG1">George Brown</persName>, to withdraw our forces from the Far East
                            and the Middle East by the end of the financial year 1970/71. But, as
                            George explained, we fixed this deadline subject to reconsideration in
                            the light of the account he brought back of your government's
                            views and what George Thomson returned to tell us of the views of the
                            Commonwealth governments in the area. We also, as you may have seen,
                            sent the Minister of State in the Foreign Office to discuss our
                            intentions with the heads of government and others concerned in the
                            Middle East. In the light of your message to me, of the reports from our
                            other colleagues and of our deep and searching discussion with Harry
                            Lee, who flew to London this weekend, we have decided to defer our
                            withdrawal for a further nine months, i.e. to the end of 1971. I know
                            that this will still seem too soon to yourself and to many others. But,
                            in the face of the appallingly difficult decisions we are having to take
                            over home expenditure, I believe that it is a significant contribution
                            to the time needed to help those in the areas concerned prepare for the
                            day when we shall no longer have a military presence
                            there—for, believe me, it is only of our military presence
                            that we are speaking. We know that its withdrawal involves risks. We
                            believe that there is no option but to run them. But we intended to
                            continue our aid programmes to the best of our ability, and of course to
                            maintain our political, trading and economic interests there.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the F111. Again, I ask you to believe that my colleagues and I
                            have spent many hours of discussion and heart-searching on this problem
                            at three separate meetings and gave the fullest weight to the
                            considerations advanced in your message. But we have come to the
                            reluctant conclusion that the only way we can achieve the really
                            decisive economies that are essential in the hardware budget of the
                            Royal Air Force, while still keeping effective and sophisticated
                            capabilities in all three services, is to cancel the order for the 50
                            F111 aircraft. I hope you are wrong in assessing that this decision will
                            be interpreted abroad as a disengagement from any commitments to the
                            security of areas outside Europe or indeed largely in Europe as well.
                            And you are certainly <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0650"/>wrong if
                            you take the view you mentioned that it is “a strong
                            indication of British isolation.” In fact, I believe both
                            these views to be wrong. As I shall be explaining tomorrow, we intend to
                            make to the alliances of which we are members, a contribution related to
                            our economic capability; we shall not be withdrawing from our three
                            major alliances; and the general capability that we shall retain in this
                            country and on the continent can also be deployed overseas and will
                            still thus enable us to continue to give assistance to our international
                            partners and other allies concerned, if the circumstances so demand.</p>
                        <p>Against this background and having regard to what you yourself said in
                            the second of your two messages, I nevertheless hope that <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Denis Healey</persName> and Bob McNamara, for
                            whose helpful efforts in these matters we are all most grateful, can
                            reach an early agreement in broad terms about continued credit
                            facilities for the unchanged Phantom and Hercules programmes and for
                            appropriate adaptation of the offset arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Believe me, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon</persName>, the decisions
                            we are having to take now have been the most difficult and the heaviest
                            of any that I, and I think all my colleagues, can remember in our public
                            life. We are not taking them in a narrow or partisan spirit. We are
                            taking them because we are convinced that, in the longer term, only thus
                            can Britain find the new place on the world stage that I firmly believe
                            the British people ardently desire. And when I say “the world
                            stage” I mean just that.</p>

                            January 20, 1968, prior to <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s visit to the Soviet Union January 22-24.
                            The purpose of Bundy's visit was to assure coordination
                            between the two nations over Vietnam policy. A portion of a briefing
                            paper prepared for the President summarizing these talks reads:
                            “Following instructions cleared by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Bundy stressed to <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> that he must make it absolutely
                            clear that he was not authorized by the US to do any exploring on the
                            San Antonio formula.” (Note for President's

                        <p>The Prime Minister and his train arrived from London last night. He
                            brought with him Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSB1">Burke Trend</persName>, Denis Greenhill,
                            Michael Halls, Michael Palliser, Gerald Kaufman (Public Relations
                            Adviser), T.D. Lloyd-<persName corresp="#p_HTL1">Hughes</persName>
                            (Press Secretary), and Donald Murray (Head of South East Asia
                            Department, Foreign Office).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">John Leddy</persName>, Bob Bowie, Harry
                            Shullaw, and I went over to meet this group, to which was attached
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Pat Dean</persName> and Ed Tompkins from
                            the British Embassy, at 11:30 this morning. The road from the White
                            House Northwest Gate to the Diplomatic entrance was lined with Army,
                            Navy, and Air Force men, standing at attention with fixed bayonets. I
                            trailed along behind the President as he met his guests in front of a
                            battery of cameramen.</p>
                        <p>The President and Prime Minister disappeared into the Oval Office,
                            unattended, from which they emerged two and a half hours later (2
                            o'clock). The rest of us cooled our heels in the Cabinet
                            Room, but this was pleasant enough since every one there had known the
                            others for a long time. We were joined by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, who was hawkishly gratified by how things
                            are going in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Our unpredictable President announced we must all be hungry and should
                            follow him upstairs in the White House to drink and eat. Poor <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Pat Dean</persName> was thoroughly discomfited,
                            for he had arranged a large lunch at home for the Prime Minister.
                            However, there was no choice; <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0652"/>exactly the same thing happened when <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Harold
                                Wilson</persName> was last here. Pat was initially angry, but
                            yielded with good spirit.</p>
                        <p>The newspapers last night made merry over the selections chosen by the
                            orchestra for this evening's State Dinner. Amongst the titles
                            was <hi rend="italic">On the Road to Mandalay</hi>, and one or two
                            others that seemed especially inapposite in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s case. When, however,
                            he heard of Protocol's embarrassment over this, he insisted
                            the program stand.</p>
                        <p>While we were drinking before lunch, the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> remarked on how satisfactory had been his conversation
                            with the President. To my surprise, he told us there had been a reflow
                            of gold to London in excess of two-hundred-million dollars during the
                            past two weeks. This does not accord at all with our Embassy figures
                            reported by the Treasury Attache. Also, he said exports were increasing
                            substantially, unemployment was manageable, and all in all the economy
                            was ready to respond to the new measures.</p>
                        <p>Lunch was cheerful; the President recounted some good Texas stories.
                            Incidentally, he spoke warmly of how helpful President Eisenhower had
                            always been to him, and of his deep affection for the General.</p>
                        <p>When they left, I stayed behind for a few minutes with the President. He
                            said his talk with Wilson had been satisfactory, and without rancor,
                            although he had spoken sternly about British plans for withdrawal from
                            the Far East and Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> gave him glowingly optimistic predictions of how
                            Britain would pull itself up by its bootstraps.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow 9 paragraphs dealing with social and personal matters.]</p>
                        <p>The toasts to the Queen and the President were not out of the ordinary.
                            Each had been carefully prepared. L.B.J. was laudatory of Britain, but
                            did not single out <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> for
                            individual praise. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was cagey, but
                            satisfactory on Vietnam. There were no fireworks in either
                            production.</p>

                        <p>As you will guess, I have been personally following every move in the
                            discussion in Washington this weekend and I share what I know will be
                            your satisfaction that we have all been able to reach an agreed
                                solution.<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">Reference is to the March
                                16-17 meeting of governors of the central banks of the seven
                                “gold pool” nations. For text of

                                p. 464.</note> As you know, from the outset the British delegation
                            joined with yours in rejecting any solution based on a change in the
                            price of gold. We support you completely in this matter, and this has
                            never been in doubt.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the agreement announced tonight is the best that could be
                            achieved in present circumstances. We must hope that it will carry
                            sufficient conviction in the world financial arena to stop the nonsense
                            which has been going on in these past weeks. It is impossible to be
                            certain, because we are dealing with a degree of irrationality which I
                            have today described as Gadarene Dementia. In addition there have been
                            the signs of a hidden hand in operation against the dollar and the
                            pound—and not all that hidden either.<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">Reference is to President de Gaulle.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a rational world this clear evidence of determination should be
                            decisive. But we must, even at this stage, reckon with the possibility
                            that the irrational elements with which we have to deal may take charge.
                            If this is so, the attack will switch more directly from the gold
                            markets to the foreign exchange markets and will be directed against the
                            two reserve currencies. Our continental colleagues have responded well
                            to the dangers which we all face and I welcome the special consideration
                            given to the position of sterling. Sterling has been, and still is, in
                            the front line, but in a very real sense we all stand together. This
                            stood out from the message you sent me on Thursday night.<note n="4" xml:id="d294fn4">A copy of Johnson's March 15 message is

                            protect ourselves, we should be forced to take action which could have a
                            grave effect on all other currencies.<note n="5" xml:id="d294fn5">A copy

                            this has been reiterated by my colleagues and our determination is
                            absolute.</p>

                        <p>Let us hope that what is happening in Washington means that the attack
                            will now spend itself. But if it does not, we must urgently consult
                            together to agree what further collective action can be taken in order
                            to avert the danger that we may be driven apart. Should we reach this
                            point, we shall not propose a change in the gold price, but there are
                            other policies that might have to be urgently considered between us. It
                            is too early to canvass the various arguments, though we should prefer
                            an arrangement providing for an embargo on the buying and selling of
                            gold to anything which gave the enemy the prize for which they are
                            contending, namely an increase in the gold price. We must keep in close
                            touch if necessary on a day-to-day basis this week, though again, I hope
                            that what has been achieved in response to your lead on Thursday night
                            may exorcise once and for all the danger we have been facing
                            together.</p>

                            POLICY</p>
                        <p>Britain's severe economic problems have shaken the
                            international monetary system and sealed a historic transformation of
                            British foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The financial pressures of last November forced the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to devalue the pound (from $2.80 to
                            $2.40). That decision marked the failure of Labour's previous
                            policy of demi-austerity and necessitated severe budget cuts.
                            Devaluation was followed by another rejection by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s Common Market bid. These setbacks led to a
                            widespread public loss of confidence in Labour and in <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>. A change in Labour leadership in
                            the coming months, though remote, is no longer out of the question.</p>
                        <p>The British Government's vital objective is to make a success
                            of last November's devaluation. Britain is seeking to achieve
                            a 1,000 million pounds ($2.4 billion) turnaround in its balance of
                            payments, i.e. to move <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0655"/>from a
                            deficit of over 500 million pounds in 1967 to a sustained surplus at the
                            rate of 500 pounds million beginning in 1969.</p>
                        <p>The necessity of success has produced new policies far from
                            Labour's socialist ideology: curtailed public spending, even
                            in the welfare sector; a mandatory prices and incomes policy closely
                            correlated to productivity; and rigorous measures to reduce domestic
                            demand in order to shift resources into exports and private investment.
                            Cooperation from the domestic sector and the patience of the
                            international financial community are vital to Britain's
                            success, but these factors are not assured and the outcome therefore is
                            in doubt.</p>
                        <p>Since November, the direction of Britain's defense and foreign
                            policy has become clearer and firmer. The Government has accelerated
                            curtailment of world-wide commitments and clarification of its policy
                            toward Europe. Still, the process is far from complete. Continued
                            frustration of Britain's new European vocation nourishes
                            traditional British parochialism, resentment toward France, and
                            suspicion of Germany. Conservative Party leaders have attacked the
                            Government's “retreat from East of
                            Suez,” but before they can come to power, the cutbacks will
                            probably have gone so far as to be irreparable. Thus, we can see the
                            Britain of the future as, at best, a middle-sized, European power,
                            albeit one with a nuclear capability, a residual sense of extra-European
                            responsibility, and a continuing, if diminished, status as a favored
                            partner of the US.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> RELATIONS AND US
                            OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p>We can expect British governments gradually to attenuate the
                            “special relationship” as the prospect of
                            achieving their aims in Europe becomes more credible, but they will not
                            repudiate it entirely as long as it has advantages for them.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> continues to have economic and
                            political assets which can provide valuable support for our own foreign
                            policy objectives; for example, the British desire to play a
                            constructive role in Western European political affairs and to provide
                            substantial amounts of foreign aid in the less developed world. In
                            addition they still have extensive Commonwealth contacts. These assets
                            would probably be strengthened by a victory in the next General Election
                            of the Conservative Party, which is currently running far ahead of
                            Labour in by-elections, local elections, and public opinion polls.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">A. The Problem of Sterling</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No one can be certain that the post-devaluation economic program will
                            succeed in producing the necessary, enduring balance of payments <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0656"/>surplus. The basic positive
                            factors are: the competitive edge provided by devaluation, the buoyancy
                            in Britain's main export markets, and bold fiscal and
                            monetary restraints on the domestic economy.</p>
                        <p>The negative factors are: a history of repeated crises; organized
                            labor's reluctance, if not unwillingness, to accept wage
                            restraint; archaic labor and management practices; a stubbornly high
                            level of import demand; high interest rates in the US and in Europe;
                            Britain's precarious liquidity position; continuing
                            nervousness about sterling; and the generally precarious international
                            monetary situation.</p>
                        <p>The financial world so far has patiently awaited evidence that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is gradually moving toward surplus. Such
                            patience is not unlimited and could be cut short by widespread strikes
                            this summer or the collapse of the wage restraint policy. Then the
                            financial world may well conclude that Britain's economic
                            program is not going to succeed. This could lead to speculative selling
                            of sterling, including further switching out of pounds by sterling area
                            central banks.</p>
                        <p>Britain has substantial resources in standby credits and swaps to help
                            meet such an eventuality. In a severe crisis they would need
                            augmentation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic"> US Position</hi>: It is important to us that the
                            British economic program succeed. The consequences of failure were
                            portrayed last November, when the fall of one reserve currency,
                            sterling, led to severe pressure on the dollar, to the gold crisis, to
                            the forced termination of the “Gold Pool”
                            arrangements, and to a large decline in US gold reserves. If Britain
                            fails to achieve its balance of payments objective, there could be
                            another deep sterling crisis which would put renewed pressure of the
                            most serious kind on the dollar.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On February 19 <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> announced that its
                            defense will in the future be concentrated mainly in Europe and the
                            North Atlantic area. On May 10 Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HDW1">Healey</persName> announced that withdrawals from
                            the Far East and the Persian Gulf have enabled <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to make an immediate contribution to strengthening
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s forces in Europe
                            and the Mediterranean along the following lines: (1) a mobile task force
                            (some 20,000 men) will be stationed in Britain but available for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense; (2) an amphibious task force
                            will be stationed in European waters; (3) two frigates will be kept in
                            the Mediterranean; (4) a squadron of reconnaissance aircraft will remain
                            in Malta until 1970; (5) in 1969, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            is prepared to send a commando carrier with troops embarked to
                            participate in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> exercises in the
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is also exploring the possibility
                            of some modest first steps that might evolve into a kind of European
                            defense organization in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            framework. The British have in mind initially talking with the <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0657"/>European Community members
                            (less the French), and perhaps the Danes and Norwegians, about the
                            possibility of cooperation in the defense production and procurement
                            field. Subsequently, they would hope to see a kind of European caucus in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> under which the nations
                            concerned could concert their positions on force levels, strategy, and
                            other questions in advance of discussions with us.</p>
                        <p>Thus, by working quietly within the established <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> hopes
                            to be able to avoid another head-on collision with the French which
                            would in turn frighten off the Germans and other European Community
                            members. This approach also assures a close institutional link between
                            any future European defense organization and the United States, as well
                            as with the other allies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic"> US Position</hi>: We have been quietly encouraging the
                            British in these efforts as they are consistent with our long-standing
                            attitude favoring Western European cooperation and unification. If the
                            British succeed, the result would be an improved political balance in
                            the Alliance. It would also improve prospects that the European members
                            together could pick up more of the burden of their own defense. Care
                            must be exercised to avoid the appearance of an Anglo-American
                            initiative.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom is maintaining its application for full <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> membership. It has not endorsed recent
                            proposals from among the Six for interim commercial arrangements.
                            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said
                            recently that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would only be
                            interested in “proposals coming from the Six as a whole which
                            are clearly and unmistakably connected with our full membership in the
                            European Economic Community.” The British see little prospect
                            that the Six will be able to agree on acceptable interim proposals.</p>
                        <p>The French veto on British membership has not diminished support within
                            Britain for full membership. The British Government and, in general, the
                            public seem to realize that there is no viable alternative to entry into
                            the Communities. Proponents of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area (<gloss target="#t_NAFTA1">NAFTA</gloss>) have generated little British
                            interest, in or outside the government.</p>
                        <p>The British are expected to make some new move to maintain forward
                            movement on membership, perhaps this summer. Britain is most likely to
                            propose collaborations on military-political matters and technology
                            which are outside the clear responsibility of the Rome Treaty and which
                            it would be easier for the Five to act upon without openly provoking

                            specifically wish to (a) encourage the British to maintain as much of
                            their present special role as long as possible; (b) encourage the Saudis
                            and Iranians in particular to settle outstanding differences; (c)

                        <p>Last January 16, <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> announced
                            the withdrawal of all British military forces from the
                            Malaysia/Singapore area by the end of 1971.</p>
                        <p>The British declared that they would continue to meet their <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> obligations after 1971 within the
                            limits of their resources and would retain a “general
                            capability for deployment overseas” if <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> judged such deployment necessary.
                            However, they have declined to be drawn out on the nature of this
                            capability or how it will be brought to bear in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The phase-down is calculated to minimize adverse effects on the economies
                            of Malaysia and Singapore, and give them time to build up their own
                            forces. A working group of the UK, Malaysia, and Singapore has begun
                            discussing a proposed air defense system. A five-nation Defense
                            Ministers' conference will be held in Kuala Lumpur in early
                            June.</p>
                        <p>Australia and New Zealand are unlikely alone to fill the vacuum which

                            been unable to bring an end to the illegal regime of Ian Smith in spite
                            of discussions, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> voluntary
                            sanctions program (November 1965), or the limited <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandatory sanctions program (December 1966). The
                            sanctions program suffers from the refusal of South Africa and Portugal
                            to participate and from lax or incomplete compliance by Japan, West
                            Germany, France, and other industrialized countries. The British insist
                            that the best method of bringing pressure on Smith is through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> sanctions, and the Security Council is
                            considering making selected mandatory sanctions more comprehensive.</p>

                            current French crisis. The British may be expected privately to consider
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s
                            difficulties should serve as a salutary shock to his reputation. On the
                            other hand, they would be apprehensive about the uncertain effects of
                            political and economic instability in France.</p>
                        <p>Current troubles in France are not likely to help the near-term British
                            economic position since (1) any tremors in the international monetary
                            system seem to reverberate against sterling; (2) a reduction in French
                            economic activity will hurt British exports to France; and (3) weakness
                            of French exports in third markets will offer Britain new opportunities
                            only over the longer term.</p>
                        <p>If, as seems likely, the French response to recent internal developments
                            produces an expansionary, inflationary situation in the country, over
                            the longer term the balance of payments impact would be adverse to
                            France and presumably help to reduce the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> balance of payments deficits. Though we can visualize
                            some weakening in the French balance of payments, it is too early to
                            judge whether recent events will force the eventual devaluation of the
                            franc. We should note that France has large reserves of gold and dollars
                            with which the franc can be defended.</p>

                        <p>1. We are in an interim period in our relations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A. A watchful waiting attitude is customary during our election year.</p>
                        <p>B. Both Canada and France are also in an election period.</p>
                        <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>C. Belgium and Italy are in the process of forming new governments.</p>
                        <p>D. A difficult and uncertain situation exists in Greece.</p>
                        <p>2. At the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting scheduled later
                            this month in Iceland, our objectives will be to prevent disarray in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The uncertainty in Europe has the effect of increasing the importance
                            to Europeans of the level of U.S. forces in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then turned to the
                            current situation in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He made the
                            following points in addition to summarizing a recent cable from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> (copy

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName> Government is in
                            difficulty with all Britishers and confronts divisions within the Labor
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>2. Despite <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>'s
                            troubles, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is more stable than
                            France.</p>
                        <p>3. Many Britishers have not adjusted to their new role in the world.</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is steadily withdrawing from its
                            security commitments in distant areas but at the same time is giving
                            more support to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The size of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> depends on whether the Labor
                            government succeeds in improving the economic situation in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. The special relationship the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has
                            with us is less important to them now because the British have less
                            interest in maintaining a world role. Operationally, the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are working on fewer real problems. The
                            concept of Atlantic cooperation could replace the special relationship.
                            Close bilateral relations with the British, however, will certainly
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>, describing the
                            State paper<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">

                            that sterling is the major U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            problem. Aspects of the sterling crisis involve:</p>
                        <p>1. Short-term funding. We have assisted the British, particularly in
                            supporting their requests for international bank withdrawals.</p>
                        <p>2. Bilateral credits.</p>
                        <p>3. The role of sterling in an international monetary system.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> financial situation is precarious
                            and, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s view, British resources to apply to this
                            problem may be less than indicated in the State Department's
                            paper. Essentially, he added, continental countries have confidence in
                            London and have welcomed British actions reflected in the last <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> budget. However, the London financial
                            community has less confidence in the Wilson Government. This is because
                            the British Government and the London business community are out of
                            step.</p>

                            would be an improvement. He doubts that the Conservatives could handle
                            the economic situation, especially a wage-price policy, as well as the
                            Labor Party has done.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the current situation in London, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said the British were losing
                            large amounts of reserves not only because of widespread lack of
                            confidence in sterling but also because several countries are
                            diversifying their reserves. This diversification puts pressure on the
                            pound because those countries in the pound bloc move out of sterling
                            into other currencies. Thus, events are forcing Britain to recognize
                            that the pound will not much longer be used as a reserve currency. The
                            immediate problem is how to deal with the sterling balances held in
                            those countries which are diversifying their reserves.</p>
                        <p>As to France, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                            predicted that DeGaulle would seek to maintain the franc at its present
                            rate. In the future, France might have to devalue—possibly as
                            early as this fall—in order to meet wage increases which the
                            government will be forced to grant French workmen. If the French do
                            devalue, heavy pressure will fall on the British just at the time they
                            may well be getting their financial situation in balance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> called attention
                            to the loss of U.S. reserves in the last six months. He said work was
                            going forward on how to deal multilaterally with the problem of sterling
                            balances in other countries. Contingency plans are being drawn to insure
                            that the sterling problem does not have a major unfavorable impact on
                            the dollar. In addition, initiatives are being worked out to deal with
                            the impact in Europe of instability of the pound and franc which
                            undoubtedly will affect the dollar. These initiatives can be taken only
                            after the tax bill is passed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> said that the
                            British do not have the resources, the backup, or the hardware to deal
                            with any big world problem. He said they are no longer a powerful ally
                            of ours because they cannot afford the cost of an adequate defense
                            effort. He made these points:</p>
                        <p>1. Earlier we had the closest working relations with the British. They
                            looked after one part of the world and we looked after another part.</p>
                        <p>2. The British are continuing their contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but are retrenching elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. It is not certain that the British can keep even their present level
                            of forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Although the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is earmarking for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> those troops being withdrawn from
                            other areas, no real increase in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            power results because the earmarked forces merely help to bring the
                            British <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contribution up to the
                            level they have previously maintained.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> acknowledged
                            that the British withdrawal creates real problems for us in Southeast
                            Asia, in other parts of Asia, and <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0663"/>particularly in the Mediterranean where the Soviets
                            recently have become more active.</p>
                        <p>In response to a request by the President, Mr. Rostow said one question
                            he would like to have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> answer was whether the chance of the British
                            getting into the Common Market was greater now that DeGaulle is in
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> to reply. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> said DeGaulle will not
                            change his opposition to British entry even though he is in difficulty
                            in France. DeGaulle will, however, have greater difficulty in carrying
                            out his effort to prevent British entry.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reported that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> believes
                            DeGaulle may win a large majority in the forthcoming French election. If
                            this happens, DeGaulle will be able to exert considerable pressure on
                            other Common Market members to continue to hold out against British
                            entry. If DeGaulle loses the election, however, his power to oppose
                            British entry may be considerably reduced. A second factor affecting
                            British entry is that the new Italian government may not be as strong
                            for British entry as past Italian governments have been.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rostow pointed out that the only operational matter was the
                            suggestion that State-Treasury recommendations for actions to deal with
                            the current monetary situation be sent to the President promptly.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that such recommendations be prepared for him.<note n="4" xml:id="d296fn4">Not found.</note>

                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>. He asked <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> whether there was any news from

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said that the Prime
                            Minister believed that the only way to see whether there was any basis
                            for agreement was to see Smith. He would keep us fully informed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> went on to say that the
                            debate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was dominated by the
                            Czechoslovakia and Middle East discussions. On the Middle East there had
                            been a great deal of private talk to see what could be done to advance
                            the Jarring Mission.<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">Between January and May
                                1968, Gunnar Jarring, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special
                                Representative in the Middle East, met with Arab and Israeli
                                officials in Cyprus. After his return to New York, Jarring continued
                                secret discussions relating to a Middle East peace
                                settlement.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President said he had tried to encourage both sides to support
                            Jarring. He believed the Eban speech suggested some progress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said that Eban had
                            complained to him that the rest of the world too easily accepted the
                            proposition that there should not be direct negotiation. <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> had tried to impress on Eban the
                            need for the Israelis to declare themselves on the Security Council
                            resolution. Eban said he would consider this with the objective of
                            laying the base for talks with Jordan—first through Jarring
                            and then directly.</p>
                        <p>The President said Jarring would fail unless the two sides began to move.
                            Jarring had been patient but he couldn't continue
                            indefinitely without movement.</p>
                        <p>Rostow suggested that Jarring might be somewhat more optimistic than he
                            sounds. He may be using his pessimism as a lever to push for
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to Czechoslovakia and said it was essential that the
                            world wake up to the danger before it was too late.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said some talk was a
                            necessary part of the response. That was why the British had wanted to
                            move quickly to the Security Council— <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0665"/>to show that not only <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but the interests of the world were
                            involved in the Czech invasion. The Afro-Asian countries automatically
                            gravitated to the Soviet pole on this kind of issue: how would they act
                            on this one?</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName>'s views on the <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> speech to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d297fn4">For text of

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said it was cautious and
                            made clear that the Russians faced a difficult problem. Their objective
                            was to act as though nothing had happened, and they particularly wanted
                            to create this impression as far as their relations with the U.S. were
                            concerned. We, on the other hand, cannot say we will have no further
                            dealings with them. We do have problems we must solve together, and we
                            should get on with disarmament matters. It is a difficult line to draw
                            but we must continually remind them and the world of what they have
                            done. Even more serious, we must think very hard about what we would do
                            if there are any further adventures.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was very concerned about the possibility of
                            isolationism in the U.S. and the effects on keeping our troops in
                            Europe. He said the British withdrawals hadn't helped.
                            Czechoslovakia provided some time. It was necessary now to use that time
                            well. Our people have gotten the impression that others are not pulling
                            their share of the load. He was confident that we could stay in Europe
                            indefinitely if others showed they were helping.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said he understood this and
                            the British were acting to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said he wanted to raise another
                            question—the concern that smaller European countries had over
                            U.S. negotiations with the Russians. He said some matters clearly
                            affected primarily the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Some, on the other
                            hand, affected <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole. There
                            was a feeling among smaller <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries that these latter issues would be settled over their heads.
                            Would it be possible to draw a dividing line between those issues we
                            settle bilaterally and those on which we would consult fully?</p>
                        <p>The President said he had tried very hard over five years to make some
                            progress with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to see what
                            could be done to narrow our differences in defensive arrangements, in
                            offensive and defensive weapons, in the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He said that there had been meetings at the
                            Ambassadorial and Ministerial levels and at the Summit and there had
                            been a lot of personal correspondence. He did not see very strong
                            promise of our getting anywhere with this during the balance of the
                            year. The next President would have to explore this again and make
                            careful preparations. This would take time. On all these issues we had
                                <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0666"/>and would continue to get
                            the advice of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and to keep them
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that there had been progress on some issues in
                            Glassboro and up through the day before the Czechoslovakian invasion;
                            but he was not optimistic now. He repeated that we would not see anybody
                            or take any action without full consultation and exchange with our
                            Allies. Talks had been long overdue in the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> field but this issue was now on the back burner. He had
                            no desire to travel but he was eager to move forward on U.S. business
                            and on the world's business; but progress was not likely now
                            until after the election and probably not until six months after the new
                            President came into office.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> asked whether he believed
                            there would be significant change in the defense and foreign policy
                            positions in the U.S. after the election. The President thought there
                            would be some rethinking. For example, a Republican President and a
                            Democratic Senate could have awkward consequences. A Democratic
                            President with Republican gains in the Congress could cause problems. He
                            read <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> a portion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> statement he was about to make,
                            which mentioned the possibility that he would call the Congress back
                            into session.<note n="5" xml:id="d297fn5">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                            thought that ratification of the Treaty would come eventually. The
                            President said he could not predict but he was concerned. It was
                            important that we move. The longer we waited the more the issue would be
                            in doubt.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> asked whether the President
                            saw any change in our Vietnam policy after a new Administration came
                            into office. The President said that any new Administration would take a
                            new look. As far as he was concerned he was convinced that whatever
                            concessions we would make would never be enough unless we got some
                            indication that they were prepared to do something. It didn't
                            have to be reciprocal. We would be willing to stop if they understood
                            that if they started shelling cities or increasing activity in the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> we would resume bombing and if
                            they accepted the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as a negotiating
                            partner—a condition essential for serious and productive
                            discussions of a settlement.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said that the British fully
                            supported the President's position, but they would have
                            difficulty if the Americans abandoned it without warning. In that
                            context, he asked whether Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>'s most recent statement represented
                            a change.<note n="6" xml:id="d297fn6">Reference is to a September 30
                                statement by the Vice President that if elected he would stop the

                                to negotiate seriously for an end to the conflict.</note> The
                            President said that he believed that <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> tried to say that he would <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0667"/>stop the bombing if they restored the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. His emphasis created some
                            doubt. In the end, however, he did not believe that the position was
                            different. In any event, there would be no change until January 20.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> said it was their
                            impression that the Soviet leaders visiting Cambodia intended to put
                            some pressure on the North Vietnamese.<note n="7" xml:id="d297fn7">Not
                                further identified.</note> The President said that he was not much
                            of an authority on North Vietnam. He had thought for a long time that,
                            faced with their prospects, they would make some move. Sometimes he had
                            thought they were moving, only to be disappointed. He believed and
                            continued to believe that it is in their interest to make a move. They
                            will not gain anything until January 20, and what they might gain after
                            that will not be worth what they will be losing until then.</p>

                            they would be wrong if they thought they could alter public opinion in
                            their favor by holding out. He told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that he thought the effects would be the other
                            way. And he believed that this, in fact, had been the case. But he asked
                            whether the Russians had talked to the North Vietnamese on this and how
                            much influence they had. The President said he did not know. He had
                            thought that Glassboro and other talks might have some results; but this
                            did not prove to be the case.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM2">Stewart</persName> again went back to the
                            question of contingency planning regarding further Soviet moves. He said
                            he believed the Russians fully understood what would happen if they
                            moved against any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. They
                            probably also were pretty confident that if they moved against Warsaw
                            Pact countries they probably would not get a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> response. But what happened in the
                            intermediate cases? What would we really do and what tactics should we
                            employ to tell the Russians? The President agreed that it was important
                            that we work hard on this kind of contingency planning and move along
                            with it.</p>

                        <p>Before year-end, we must decide whether we want to exercise our option to
                            terminate certain information exchanges under our 1958 Agreement with
                            the United Kingdom on Military Nuclear Cooperation. We will not again
                            have this option for another five years.</p>
                        <p>We have agreements for very limited cooperation in the nuclear weapons
                            field with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and ten countries. The
                            arrangement with the United Kingdom is unique, however, because it
                            provides for exchanges of information relating to weapons design and
                            manufacture and supply of nuclear materials for weapons.</p>

                        <p>There is one issue which must be decided now, and a related question
                            which should be considered but does not require a decision at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>—Under the Agreement, we have the
                            option, until December 31, 1968, to terminate Article II, which provides
                            for the exchange of information on nuclear weapons and military
                            reactors—in addition to <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0669"/>the more limited information which we also exchange
                            with most of our other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. If
                            we exercise the option, these exchanges will terminate at the end of
                            1969. If we do not, we will not again have the option to terminate
                            Article II for another five years. There is every reason to think the
                            British want to continue exchanges in the nuclear weapons field.
                            Congress does not need to act. A subsidiary issue is the extent to which
                            we would continue the flow of information to the British assuming
                            Article II is not terminated. The Agreement leaves that to our
                            discretion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>—The related question is whether,
                            if the British ask us, we should extend the 1959 Amendment on weapons
                            materials and equipment exchanges to the 1958 Agreement. Under that
                            Amendment, which does not expire until the end of 1969, we have been
                            supplying the British with weapons-grade uranium, tritium, and other
                            materials, and with non-nuclear parts of weapons. No decision is needed
                            now. Undoubtedly, however, the British will propose a new Amendment that
                            would keep open the option of continuing such exchanges. They will
                            probably wait until early next year to approach us. In the unlikely
                            event that they approach us this year, we could begin preliminary staff
                            work but would tell them that a decision would have to be made by the
                            next Administration. A new Amendment would have to be submitted to
                            Congress for the statutory sixty-day waiting period before it enters
                            into force.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom's nuclear forces only marginally supplement
                            our own. But the fact of the matter is the British consider a small
                            nuclear deterrent to be better than none. They will require some further
                            weapons information and materials merely to maintain its effectiveness.
                            They are unwilling to give up their nuclear deterrent except in return
                            for an effective European nuclear arrangement which would substitute for
                            both the British and French national nuclear programs. As of now, no
                            such arrangement is in sight.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, unilateral termination by us would cause
                            serious disaffection between our two countries, both major British
                            parties being firmly committed to the retention of an independent
                            British nuclear deterrent. It could also appear to be indirectly
                            promoting France as the principal Western European country in the
                            nuclear business.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, it is true that the nuclear weapons arrangement is a
                            symbol of our “special relationship” and therefore
                            a factor of major significance in French attitudes toward British
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. However, the
                            British, rather than we, need to judge when this aspect of our
                            relationship should be limited or terminated to meet their political
                            objectives in Western Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0670"/>
                        <p>Continuation of some cooperation in the nuclear weapons field will also
                            permit us to monitor closely the work being carried out by the British
                            and will help to assure that we receive the benefits of their technical
                            advances.</p>
                        <p>We do not expect, however, that such benefits from British technical
                            advances in the nuclear weapons field will be of more than limited value
                            to us. For this, as well as for security reasons, we would not furnish
                            information which reveals the vulnerability levels of United States
                            missile systems.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of our cooperation with the United Kingdom in this field
                            would not compromise our objectives of promoting the Non-Proliferation
                            Treaty. The various U.S./U.K. Agreements do not provide for the transfer
                            of manufactured warheads or their nuclear cores, but are confined to
                            assistance in the <hi rend="italic">manufacture</hi> of warheads. Such
                            assistance among nuclear weapons states is not prohibited by the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The 1958 Agreement for Cooperation also provided for limited assistance
                            to the United Kingdom in naval nuclear propulsion technology. Our
                            obligations in this field will have been completely fulfilled by
                            mid-1969, excepting reactor safety information, to be provided
                            unilaterally by the United States, for the propulsion plant furnished
                            earlier under the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>We do not anticipate that the British will request additional naval
                            nuclear propulsion information, and there are no plans to provide them
                            with additional assistance in this field. In any event, further
                            information would not be provided without specific approval of the
                            President. We have, however, signed a revision to the Agreement under
                            which the United States will supply specific quantities of enriched
                            uranium and other specified reactor materials for the British
                            nuclear-powered submarine program, prior to December 31, 1979.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss>, with participation of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, has concluded:</p>
                        <p>—The United States should not take steps to alter current
                            arrangements on exchanges of weapons <hi rend="italic">information</hi>.
                            More specifically, the United States should not act to terminate Article
                            II of the Agreement. However, it also should make no overtures
                            concerning major new British programs or significant modification (e.g.,
                            the installation of MIRVs) to existing British programs.</p>
                        <p>—Accordingly, in response to British requests, we would,
                            selectively, release that nuclear weapons information which the British
                            need to maintain the effectiveness of their <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> nuclear forces and to <hi rend="italic">evaluate</hi>
                            fully the alternatives available to them for improvement of these
                            forces. (This could include selective information on hardening
                            techniques, and information related to Poseidon technology.) We would
                                <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0671"/>also continue to exchange
                            information in certain areas of research on weapons technology which
                            offer a reasonable prospect of mutual benefit.</p>
                        <p>—If the British ask us, before January 20, to renew the 1959
                            Amendment on <hi rend="italic">materials and equipment</hi> exchanges,
                            we would tell them that a decision will have to be made by the next
                            Administration. (Since this Amendment does not expire until the end of
                            1969, a decision is not needed now.) We would begin the preliminary
                            staffing of a ten-year renewal of the Amendment—although,
                            here too, we would limit our weapons assistance strictly to what the
                            British need to maintain the effectiveness of their <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> nuclear forces. We would also continue to exchange
                            source, by-product, and special nuclear materials and non-nuclear parts
                            or materials for research on atomic weapons.</p>
                        <p>—We would make clear to the British that the extension of
                            present arrangements is intended to deal only with the <hi rend="italic">framework</hi> for cooperation on weapons information and materials
                            assistance; and that we reserve the right to evaluate any specific
                            request in this area in light of all the factors and considerations at
                            the time.</p>
                        <p>—We would be willing to limit or terminate our cooperation if
                            the British decide their special relationship with us in the nuclear
                            field prejudices their chances for entry into the European Economic
                            Community.</p>
                        <p>—Any requests the British might make for information or
                            materials or equipment for major new programs or significant
                            modification to existing programs would be submitted to the President.
                            This would include the question of whether to assist the British in the
                            development and deployment of MIRVs for their Polaris missiles or to
                            provide additional naval nuclear propulsion information.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That we not exercise our option, by December 31, 1968, to terminate
                            Article II of the 1958 Agreement for Cooperation on Uses of Atomic
                            Energy for Mutual Defense and continue that cooperation in accordance
                            with the conclusions stated above.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, we will inform the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of

                        <p>We called on Archbishop Dell'Acqua at our request. He
                            apologized for not having been able to receive us sooner, but he had
                            been briefly indisposed because of a cold which he had caught during the
                            recent trip of the Pope to reconsecrate the Abbey at Monte Cassino<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">October 24.</note>—a ceremony
                            which had been virtually rained out by torrential downpours in the
                            region. The Archbishop also added that to complicate matters his car had
                            broken down en route to Monte Cassino and that he had had to
                            “hitchhike” in order to get there in advance of
                            the Pope, whose speech he was carrying. He had succeeded in making it
                            only five minutes ahead of the Pope.</p>
                        <p>Asked whether he would be accompanying the Pope on his coming visit to
                                India,<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">The Pope planned to attend the
                                International Eucharistic Congress December 2-5.</note> the
                            Archbishop said he believed so. He went on to <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0673"/>comment that the Pope's
                            India visit would be relatively rapid and that the schedule would be
                            extremely heavy. He said he did not understand the irritation of the
                            Portuguese Government over the Pope's India visit. He, of
                            course, was quite aware of Portuguese sensitivity regarding Goa;
                            however, the place and time of the Eucharistic Congress had been set
                            four years ago, long before Goa became an international problem. The
                            Pope's visit was purely religious. He was going ostensibly to
                            attend the Eucharistic Congress which is being held in Bombay. However,
                            the Archbishop said the Pope regarded the trip much more as an
                            “ecumenical gesture.” In the Pope's
                            mind and in the mind of the Church, the fact that he would be
                            consecrating five bishops representing each of the five continents at
                            the Congress, was much more important than the Congress itself. The Pope
                            was also extremely interested in demonstrating that the Church is really
                            the “Church of the poor” that it presents itself
                            to be. To this end the Pope was taking a large amount of aid supplies
                            (the majority of which had been collected and donated through the good
                            offices of Cardinal Spellman) for distribution to the poor. It would be
                            obviously impossible for the Pope to go to a country like India, where
                            the problem of poverty is so great, without taking advantage of the
                            great opportunity offered to demonstrate vividly that the Church is
                            interested and anxious to make its contribution. In addition to Cardinal
                            Spellman's donations, the Pope had also received donations
                            from many Italian firms and individuals the most recent being a gift of
                            some 20,000 meters of lightweight cotton textiles. Certainly there was
                            no political aspect to this visit, and for this reason the Pope was
                            making it relatively brief and would be there no more than two days at
                            the maximum. The Archbishop had already received a number of requests
                            for the Pope to stop over either en route to the Congress or on his
                            return flight to Rome in countries such as Pakistan and Lebanon.
                            However, these had all been refused. The schedule and organization of
                            the Pope's visit had not been fully worked out. Monsignor
                            Paul Marcinkus of the Secretariat of State and Monsignor Macchi, the
                            Pope's private secretary, would be returning from India
                            October 31. They had been sent out to complete the arrangements for the
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>Asked whether there was any basis to the recent speculation about a
                            possible papal visit to Santo Domingo early next year to attend an
                            international congress on Mariology, the Archbishop said that he did not
                            think there was any likelihood such a visit would take place. He
                            stressed the fact that visits of this type invariably provoked requests
                            to make visits to other places. A visit to Santo Domingo would
                            immediately bring a request from the Philippines, from France and from
                            other countries which would be difficult to refuse once a precedent had
                            been established. Therefore, it was necessary to consider all such
                            proposals extremely carefully with a view to their possible
                            repercussions. The Archbishop said that it was extremely important, of
                            course, to safeguard <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0674"/>the health
                            of the Pontiff and not to impose too heavy a burden on him. Traveling of
                            this type was arduous and consumed valuable time which might better be
                            spent otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Questioned about the recent developments in connection with the ouster of
                            Soviet Premier Khrushchev,<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">October
                                16.</note> the Archbishop said that he was extremely worried and
                            concerned. Although he did not think one could yet say that these
                            developments signified the end of the process of gradual rapprochement
                            between the Soviet Union and the West, certainly he believed that there
                            was going to be a temporary halt. He went on to say that he did not
                            believe Russia's difficulties with Communist China were the
                            primary cause of the Khrushchev ouster. He believed, rather, that the
                            principal cause was a division of opinion on the German question. He had
                            noted a tendency on the part of Khrushchev to move in the direction of
                            accepting a partial solution to this outstanding problem—an
                            attitude that was apparently unacceptable to the rest of the Soviet
                            leadership. The Archbishop had heard, on what he believed to be fairly
                            good authority, that Khrushchev's son-in-law Alexei Adjubei
                            had during his recent visit to Bonn promised Chancellor Erhard that
                            Khrushchev would not interpose any objection toward West
                            Berlin's becoming a Land in the West German State. Whether or
                            not this was true, such a development would undoubtedly raise fears
                            among the more orthodox Russians who are still worried about a
                            militarily powerful and united Germany. The Archbishop also said that
                            the fact that Polish Prime Minister Gomulka had been the first of the
                            satellite leaders to approve the Khrushchev ouster was indicative that
                            certain commitments might have been made to Gomulka regarding Germany.
                            Of course, the Archbishop continued, Russia had a considerable fear of
                            China and this fear was justified. The mere fact that China's
                            huge population so outnumbered Russia's was sufficient to
                            justify this fear. Though, as a priest, he realized he should not even
                            be thinking in these terms, the Archbishop said that if 200 million
                            Chinese were to be wiped out, China as a political entity could still
                            survive. If Russia were to lose 200 million people, it would no longer
                            exist. The Archbishop did not believe that Khrushchev's
                            ouster, however, would resolve the Soviet Union's problems
                            with the Chinese. In fact, it might only make the Chinese more
                            intransigent and demanding. They still certainly continued to claim a
                            considerable part of the Soviet Union's territory and were
                            not yet backing down on any of their previous stands. The Archbishop
                            felt sure that eventually the Soviet Union must realize its only hope is
                            to get closer to the West.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop also expressed his concern over the possible increased
                            influence of the military in the Soviet Union. He was dubious <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0675"/>as to how much influence the
                            military has in determining Soviet policy but was sure they played a
                            role—particularly when it came to questions involving the
                            defense and security of the Soviet Union. For this reason, any
                            controversy concerning Germany might mean that the military would be
                            more in the picture than otherwise. With regard to personalities, the
                            Archbishop agreed with the Ambassador's tentative estimate
                            that the current Soviet leadership must be considered interim. He had a
                            feeling that perhaps in the second phase of the post-Khrushchev period
                            Podgorny might emerge as the principal leader. He believed that Mikoyan
                            was perhaps too old and that Suslov had been on “too many
                            sides of too many questions.”</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop felt that one of the unfortunate facts concerning the
                            Moscow events was that the Italian press had been completely remiss in
                            not pointing out to the Italian people that it is a defect of the
                            Communist system which has produced this crisis in Moscow and not faults
                            of individual leadership. The system is the thing that is wrong. It does
                            not provide for democratic transfer of power. Instead, the press, even
                            the right-wing press, had concentrated on the events themselves and
                            tendentious interpretations, rather than on their significance to
                            Italians who are faced with the threat of a large internal Communist
                            Party. Even the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss><note n="5" xml:id="d300fn5">The Italian Christian Democratic
                                Party.</note> newspaper <hi rend="italic">Il Popolo</hi> had failed
                            miserably to make this point which is so important particularly now
                            during the pre-electoral period. It demonstrates a general lack of
                            responsibility on the part of the press—and what was worse, a
                            throwing away of a God-given opportunity. Along the same line, the
                            Archbishop remarked that the government had shown great lack of
                            foresight in scheduling the appearance of the Bolshoi Opera at Milan
                            during the month of November. When the cultural exchange program was
                            first agreed upon it was known that elections would presumably be held
                            this month and, regardless of the artistic quality of the Bolshoi Opera,
                            it was not in the interests of democracy in Italy to be showing Russian
                            cultural achievements to enthusiastic audiences when Italians are
                            voting.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop was, frankly, disgusted with the way the campaign for the
                            administrative elections was shaping up. No work whatsoever has been
                            done and there has been little or no definition of the issues involved.
                            The <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> party, as usual, was relying on
                            the Church to do all its dirty work and doing little or nothing itself.
                            (On the past four occasions when the Ambassador had seen Archbishop
                            Dell'Acqua the latter has made the same complaint, i.e., that
                            the Party expects the Church to do everything and is not prepared to
                            carry its share of the load.) The Archbishop said the Church,
                            nevertheless, would continue to do what it could. He said he would tell
                            us in great confidence that <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0676"/>it
                            had already been decided to convene the Italian Episcopal Conference
                            (CEI) so that the Italian Bishops could make some statement concerning
                            the elections prior to the vote on November 22. In addition, they would
                            do all they could through Catholic Action and its subordinate
                            organizations. He said, however, that the Church could not continue to
                            do this indefinitely, that it was criticized constantly for taking too
                            direct a role in Italian politics, and that the job was essentially one
                            for the political parties and not for the Church. The Church was anxious
                            to help, but not to assume the responsibility which was properly that of
                            the politicians.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop continued saying the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> is
                            now desperately weak. Although he has great respect for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName>'s intellectual and moral
                            qualifications, he regrets that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Moro</persName> never seems to be able to give the impression he is
                            taking initiative of his own, or has a program to present to the Italian
                            people which he intends to carry out. Instead, in whatever he does, he
                            manages to give the impression that he has reluctantly been forced into
                            it by pressure from somewhere else in the government or from the
                            outside. This is precisely what the Italian people do not need.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop also was emphatic in his criticism of the left-wing
                            Christian Democratic La Base faction which he called stupid and
                            scandalous. Now, of all times, the Archbishop said, the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> needed a “unitary”
                            (i.e., composed of all factions) Directorate, but both at the recent
                            National Congress and subsequently at the National Council Meeting the
                            constitution of such a directorate had been prevented by the La Base
                            group. A unitary Directorate, the Archbishop believed, would not only
                            give the <gloss target="#t_DC1">DC</gloss> greater bargaining power with
                            its coalition partners but would also give the people greater confidence
                            in the Party and in the Government. As it is, they have now only the
                            impression of weakness.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Pope is here to emphasize his interest in peace and in the United
                            Nations as an instrument of peace. You and he can certainly agree with
                            emphasis on this subject.</p>
                        <p>As part of this common concern for peace, you may want to emphasize your
                            concern for disarmament. In Bombay last December, the Pope appealed to
                            all nations to divert part of their arms expenditure toward a world fund
                            for relief and medical care. You may wish to say that nothing would give
                            you greater satisfaction and that the whole effort of the United States
                            is to move in this direction just as fast as the actions of others
                            permit it.</p>
                        <p>2. You and the Pope can surely agree also on the value of informal

                        <p>3. The Pope and you can certainly note that this conversation is a
                            natural sequence to the talks which President Kennedy had with the Pope
                            on July 2, 1963.<note n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">No record of this

                        <p>4. You and the Pope are not discussing diplomatic relations or population

                            are the sensitive subjects that reporters may press Bill on, and I think
                            we would want to make an explicit denial on all of them. The one subject
                            you might wish to hedge is population control, where Bill might turn the
                            question and say that you and the Pope obviously expressed concern for
                            improving the lot of the hungry and the poor in every nation.)</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">B. Off-the-record Points</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It is of great importance to impress the Pope with our passion for
                            peace in Vietnam, and everywhere else. There have been faint indications
                            that not all Vatican circles are persuaded on this point.</p>
                        <p>2. I think you will want to express your appreciation to the Pope for his
                            prompt and effective help in specific situations in Santo Domingo and in
                            Saigon. Archbishop Clarizio in Santo Domingo, and two successive Papal
                            Nuncios in Saigon, have been very helpful to us in tight political
                            situations, and this has been the direct result of the sympathetic
                            interest of His Holiness. We are grateful.</p>
                        <p>3. You may wish to speak to the Pope about the Alliance for Progress and
                            emphasize the importance which progressive Catholic efforts can have in
                            this area. Some of our people think that the church has been a shade
                            less progressive in Latin America under Pope Paul, and a word from you
                            would be helpful if you think it wise.</p>
                        <p>4. Our Jewish friends would be grateful if they could be told afterwards
                            that you have expressed appreciation to His Holiness for the efforts of
                            the Vatican Council on the “Jewish guilt”
                                question.<note n="5" xml:id="d302fn5">The Council rejected the
                                concept of “Jewish guilt” and condemned
                                anti-Semitism in its “Declaratio de Libertate Religiosa
                                'Dignitas Humanae',” approved
                                December 8, 1965.</note> The present situation is that the Council
                            will have before it both last year's relatively progressive
                            declaration, and an amended version which is slightly less desirable
                            from the Jewish point of view. We will certainly not wish to choose up
                            sides on this one, and Lee White tells me that the fundamental point is
                            that the Council is dealing with the matter at all. (If time presses, it
                            might be simpler to avoid this very complex subject. <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0679"/>Many of the Pope's people
                            will be edgy about any comment at all from Americans.)</p>

                            since we are doing a lot for the Cardinal. If he does, you may wish to
                            underline urgently the fact that it really is time for the Cardinal to
                            be removed from our Legation in Budapest. Only the Pope can do
                            it—and even he will have trouble.</p>

                            better judges than I of exactly what should be said after this meeting,
                            I have not attempted a press briefing paper. Instead, I have given Bill
                            and <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Jack</persName> Valenti copies so that

                        <p>The President and the Pope met for more than an hour in the
                            President's quarters on the 35th floor.</p>
                        <p>The Pope arrived at 12:40 pm accompanied by the Papal Secy of State,
                            Cardinal Giovanni Cicognani. They were met at the door of the suite by
                            the President, the Vice President and the Secy of State, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>. After an exchange of
                            greetings, the President and the Pope walked into the sitting room for
                            their private conversation, which lasted from 12:42 until 1:28. They
                            were joined in the room by Monsignor Paul Marcinkus, Secy in the office
                            of the Vatican Secretariat of State, who interpreted for the Pope and
                            Mr. Jose DeSeabra of the US Dept of State, who interpreted for the
                            President. The room in which they met and conversed is in English and
                            French decor, with a deep blue rug bordered by a red design. There were
                            arrangements of yellow and white roses and yellow and orange mums. The
                            draperies are <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0680"/>in gold and white
                            satin damask. There are four paintings in the room, which remain there,
                            and appropriately, two of them were neopolitan scenes and two were
                            pastoral scenes, one by Francis Wheately and one by William James
                            Muller, entitled “The View At Gillingham.”</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his appreciation to the Pope for making so long
                            and arduous a trip, at the sacrifice of his own personal convenience, to
                            provide spiritual leadership in the quest for peace.</p>
                        <p>They reviewed various trouble spots in the world, they discussed specific
                            means of achieving peace through programs of health and education on a
                            world-wide basis; they exchanged comments on the question of race
                            relations. His Holiness expressed his personal appreciation and, also
                            speaking as head of his Church, gratitude for the President's
                            and this nation's progress in the field of civil rights. The
                            President said all the strong leaders of and supporters of justice in
                            this country were quite heartened by the recent appointment of a Negro
                            Bishop in this country.</p>
                        <p>The President discussed his visit in 1962 with Pope John XXIII.<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">Vice President Johnson visited Rome September
                                5, 1962, at the conclusion of a Middle East trip.</note> He told His

                            realize, in a very difficult and distressed period, that peace is
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>They discussed the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at some length. The
                            President said that it is his opinion that the Pope's visit
                            constituted a very strong expression of support for what the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can accomplish. The President noted the
                            recent resurgence of strength on the part of the United Nations, and
                            said that at this particular time this unusual and unprecedented visit
                            by the Pontiff will be a significant milestone, not only in the life of
                            the United Nations, but in the overriding and overall quest for peace on
                            the part of all nations.</p>
                        <p>They discussed the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a place where men
                            can meet to resolve their differences. They talked at some length on the
                            programs of the US Govt and the interest of the Church in deep and
                            continuing effort to get at the roots of poverty, illiteracy and
                            disease. The President discussed the Alliance for Progress in that
                            regard, and its objectives in Latin America. His Holiness pointed out
                            that the Church, too, in Latin America was committed to the cause of
                            justice and progress and social improvement.</p>
                        <p>It was at this point that His Holiness pointed out to the President his
                            personal and his Church's regard for the way in which the
                            President and this gov't were not simply talking about ways
                            of improving <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0681"/>the lot of people,
                            but were actually in a vigorous and forceful way moving ahead to achieve
                            these objectives.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned at this point in the discussion on education that
                            he was aware of the Church's great interest in education, not
                            only in a general way but in a personal way, through Luci's
                            studies at Georgetown in Washington. The President said “I am
                            thoroughly familiar with her education. She keeps me
                            informed.”</p>
                        <p>The Pope spoke very eloquently on this point and said that the
                            Church's interest and the interest of the American people in
                            improving the lot of people everywhere, not only spiritually but
                            physically, was indeed a common objective. Again, they reviewed the
                            significance of this visit, the historic nature of it. The President
                            said that he was stimulated and inspired by the visit of the Pope. They
                            underscored consistently throughout their conversation the larger topic
                            of peace and what both Church and State can do to achieve this
                            objective. The Pres. thanked His Holiness for coming. The Pope responded
                            by saying that he was very grateful to the President for making possible
                            this visit today in New York. The Pope said that he hoped the President
                            would continue with all of the optimism and energy at his command to
                            work for peace. Pope said—when men of the spirit look to men
                            of public affairs for guidance, it is men like the President who serve
                            the world, not only with ideas but with action.</p>

                        <p>I was received for almost an hour this morning by Pope Paul.</p>
                        <p>I found the Pope brilliant and extremely interested and concerned about
                            Vietnam developments. He seems deeply to appreciate my calling on

                        <p>The Pope showed me a complete account in English of his conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> which he promised to

                        <p>At the Pope's request, I gave a full situation briefing on
                            Vietnam in the light of the President's April 22 press
                                conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                        <p>The Pope was specially interested in the breakdown of political
                            alignments, particularly in Buddhist support of Tri Quang.<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">For documentation on the Buddhist anti-government

                            already been exhaustively informed. I explained that some of the
                            program—military and revolutionary development—had
                            begun to go quite well. This had impelled some politically ambitious
                            men, headed by Tri Quang, and taking advantage of the relief of General
                            Thi, to work for a change of government. The Communists, in turn, had
                            taken advantage of this. We faced a situation at once dangerous and
                            evolutionary. It was still true, I believed, that if the Vietnamese were
                            given something first rate—land reform and education, for
                            example—that they would fight to defend it. But stability, as
                            we know it in the West, did not seem likely.</p>
                        <p>The Pope asked whether there was any possible productive demarche towards
                            Hanoi which had not been made.</p>
                        <p>I said the U.S. Government had several open channels to Hanoi,
                            particularly through the International Control Commission, which is in
                            Hanoi every month.</p>
                        <p>To my surprise, the Pope was uninformed of the activities of the
                            International Control Commission.</p>
                        <p>I stressed the importance of the International Control Commission
                            channel, particularly through the Canadian representative. I said that
                            in view of Canadian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> member
                            Seaborn's intelligence and immense political sensitivity, I
                            was confident Hanoi was accurately and fully informed of U.S. Government
                            views and positions.</p>
                        <p>I said the problem is not lack of channels to Hanoi but simply
                            Hanoi's lack of desire for peace. The North Vietnamese
                            believe they <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0683"/>will win not due
                            to American military weakness, but because Hanoi believes the U.S.
                            Government lacks the will to win. Hanoi interprets appeals for peace as
                            signs of weakness, largely due to the Oriental mentality with a
                            Communist overlay. Thus, such appeals could actually lengthen the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The Pope seemed impressed and understanding that the real problem was a
                            lack of Hanoi's desire for peace rather than a lack of
                            channels of communication.</p>
                        <p>The Pope was impressed by the thought that, should the U.S. withdraw,
                            South Vietnam would fall into Communist hands, thus giving Hanoi a
                            diplomatic and political victory which they could not have achieved by
                            military means.</p>
                        <p>I said one form of a cease fire would be to abandon the bombing in North
                            Vietnam in return for a cessation of ground aggression in the South. No
                            honest or complete cease fire could be achieved unless accompanied by a
                            verified withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The Pope said he found this concept of a cease fire particularly
                            interesting.</p>
                        <p>Following the Papal audience, I paid a brief and cordial courtesy call on

                        <p>Your Holiness:</p>
                        <p>You have, I know, been following with prayerful concern the course of
                            events in Vietnam and the efforts we have been making to bring to an end
                            through peaceful means the tragic hostilities there.</p>
                        <p>I want to assure you that we have explored every avenue, responded to
                            every offer, and followed every lead that held out any hope that this
                            tragic conflict might be settled at the conference table. Our efforts
                            have so far been in vain.</p>
                        <p>The South Vietnamese have, instead, been subjected to intensified
                            infiltration from the North, and I have therefore had to make painful
                                <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0684"/>decisions to counter this
                            by intensified air strikes. The steps we chose were carefully limited,
                            and I have seen to it that every precaution was taken to keep to an
                            absolute minimum the damage to civilians and to non-military property. I
                            want personally to assure you that these steps were taken only after the
                            most searching review and assessment of all of the factors involved and
                            only after determining that such action was required by the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>You are fully aware of my desire to end the conflict in Vietnam as
                            quickly as possible. I can only hope that the leaders in Hanoi are
                            beginning to realize that their aggression cannot succeed.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, let me reaffirm the determination I expressed to you in
                            my letter of December 29<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">The text was

                            diplomatic relations with the Vatican. You asked for a brief rundown of
                            pros and cons on the latter point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Increasingly the Vatican is an active force, pressing for peace
                            negotiations in Vietnam. Diplomatic relations with the Vatican would
                            better coordinate with such initiatives as the Holy See might wish to
                            make.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> has visited
                            the Vatican twice.<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">December 29, 1965, and
                                July 9, 1966.</note> Each visit has been accompanied by extensive
                            publicity. Most confidentially, a member of the Curia expressed concern
                            after the second visit that this highly publicized consultation could
                            create problems for the Vatican's public stance of
                            impartiality. A regular mission would facilitate quiet diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>2. Relations with the Vatican would strengthen America's
                            world-wide peace image. It would be a demonstration of
                            America's concern for the moral opinion of mankind.</p>
                        <p>3. Relations would remove the anomaly of the United States, along with
                            the Soviet Union and Red China, being among the very few powers which
                            fail to maintain relations.</p>
                        <p>4. With the increasing ecumenical spirit in American Protestantism,
                            relations with the Vatican would have considerable support among the
                            Protestant churches associated with the National Council (although not
                            with the Southern Baptists and fundamentalists).</p>
                        <p>5. Recognition would be welcomed by American Catholics as an important
                            step, taken by a Protestant President, and the removal of a
                            long-standing and senseless indignity.</p>
                        <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0686"/>
                        <p>6. Relations with the Vatican would facilitate cooperation in matters
                            like the Cardinal Mindszenty case. There is no doubt that the Vatican is
                            involved in political situations throughout the world where the United
                            States interests are deeply affected.</p>
                        <p>7. The Vatican would be a source of information about conditions in
                            Eastern Europe and elsewhere. We would have access to one of the
                            important diplomatic capitals of the world. (However, the usefulness of
                            the Vatican as a systematic source of intelligence should not be
                            overestimated. We would not be plugging into a world-wide intelligence
                            net.)</p>
                        <p>8. The President's decision would be historic, a landmark
                            among the overall accomplishments of this Administration. After
                            November, the President may be in as good a position to take this act as
                            any American President for a long time to come.</p>

                        <p>1. The prospect of political opposition in the South and border states
                            remains. This opposition might be concentrated among elements where
                            white backlash is already at work. The ratio of noise to numbers would
                            be inordinately high.</p>
                        <p>2. We already have channels of discreet communication with the
                            Vatican—through the apostolic delegate here and through
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> in Rome. We
                            have made good progress normalizing these relationships and the
                            religious issue has been quiescent. There is something to be said for
                            not stirring it up.</p>
                        <p>3. Although the Vatican reaction to the establishment of relations would
                            no doubt be highly favorable, such a move at this time might also reduce
                            the Vatican's posture of impartiality in the Cold War.</p>
                        <p>4. A Cardinal expressed the private view not long ago that US-Vatican
                            relations might be “against the trend of history”,
                            in the sense that—since Pope John's
                            accession—the Holy See has been moving away from temporal and
                            political involvement to a more spiritual role.</p>
                        <p>5. While the American hierarchy would be publicly delighted, a few of
                            them might be less enthusiastic in private. The apostolic delegate is
                            presently accredited to the American hierarchy and diplomatic relations
                            might downgrade the hierarchy's central position in
                            American-Vatican relationships.</p>
                        <p>6. The assumption by a U.S. mission of responsibility for arranging
                            approximately 65,000 Papal audiences a year might be a
                            practical—and political—inconvenience. Now the
                            North American College takes most of the heat.</p>
                        <p>It might amuse you to know that the U.S. Government never severed
                            relations with the Papal States. Congress merely cut off the money <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0687"/>for the mission a century ago.
                            The U.S. is still listed in the Vatican Year Book (with a blank after
                            it).</p>
                        <p>On foreign policy grounds, I think the arguments in favor of relations
                            are the stronger.</p>

                        <p>Your Holiness:</p>
                        <p>Upon his return from Rome, my friend, James Rowe, flew here to my ranch
                            in Texas to report to me on his discussion with you at the Audience you
                            so graciously consented to give him at my request despite the short
                                notice.<note n="2" xml:id="d307fn2">No record of this request was
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the sentiments you expressed to him I am most grateful and
                            appreciative. I feel also it would have been far better for the cause of
                            World Peace had the United States been able to announce it would accept
                            a Christmas Truce in response to the request of Your Holiness. We would
                            then have been responding to the moral suggestion of the Leader of World
                            Peace.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as you now know, the North Vietnamese Government for its
                            own propaganda purposes—and, I desperately hope, a little
                            because of its war weariness—publicly offered a Christmas
                            Truce a few days ago. Because of the propaganda implications, my
                            Government has felt it must acknowledge and accept the Truce as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>We were thus unable to make the arrangements as to time which you had
                            discussed with Mr. Rowe. As soon as I reached this decision that we had
                            to respond promptly to the public offer of North Viet-Nam I directed my
                            Government to inform the Vatican in advance.</p>
                        <p>I want to assure Your Holiness once again that I bow to no one in my
                            sincere and deep desire for peace. I will make any effort, take any step
                            and go any place which will advance the cause of a just peace. <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0688"/>This I think Your Holiness
                            knows, just as you understand so well that in the struggle over Viet-Nam
                            the United States is not the aggressor.</p>
                        <p>Again let me thank you for your graciousness and kindness to me. I am
                            particularly grateful for your prayers, and I ask that you continue to
                            pray for me.</p>

                        <p>199. Vipto 50. For the President and Secretary of State. From the Vice
                            President.</p>
                        <p>I met alone with Pope Paul VI for more than one hour on April 1.</p>
                        <p>I expressed the good wishes of President Johnson. The Pope responded
                            warmly and expressed personal admiration for the President. He went on
                            to speak of the President as a man of peace and exhibited considerable
                            concern over the President's heavy burdens due to the war in
                            Vietnam. Later on in the conversation, as we were discussing the new
                            Papal encyclical,<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">
                                <hi rend="italic">Popularum Progressorum</hi>, issued March
                                28.</note> he spoke of the President's social program. He
                            was well aware of the domestic legislation of the Great Society. He said
                            he wanted to be remembered to the President's family, that he
                            often prayed for him, and wanted to help him.</p>
                        <p>Vietnam: The Pope said that in his meeting with Podgorny,<note n="3" xml:id="d308fn3">January 29.</note> he had told the Soviet President
                            that he (the Pope) knew President Johnson to be serious and sincere in
                            his desire to obtain an honorable peace in Vietnam. The Pope went on to
                            say that with a number of foreign visitors he had expressed his faith in
                            President Johnson and in our efforts to bring the war in Vietnam to a
                            peaceful solution. He indicated <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0689"/>that Podgorny gave no negative response but seemed to accept the
                            sincerity and integrity of the Pope's statement.</p>
                        <p>Pope Paul is still concerned over the bombing of the north. He said he
                            fully recognized that the roadblocks to peace were Hanoi and, he
                            thought, China. He knew that we wanted peace and never hesitates to say
                            so. Nevertheless, he did feel that the bombing of the north was eroding
                            America's moral position. (At this point I asked the Pope if
                            it was all right if I made a note because I wanted to put down in
                            accurate substance what he had to say.) He said the United States has a
                            great mission in the world—not merely the mission of defense
                            of small nations or the mission of diplomacy to protect nations, but of
                            equal importance a moral mission, a mission of demonstrating what a free
                            society can do, a mission of showing how people of different races and
                            creeds can live together in peace and justice. He spoke at some length
                            about the moral position of the United States and the all importance of
                            that moral position being maintained without blemish. And it was at this
                            point that he returned to his concern over the bombing in North Vietnam.
                            Public opinion, he said, was against us on the bombing, and this was
                            particularly true in Europe.</p>
                        <p>I explained to the Pope our bombing pauses. I explained to him that we
                            were prepared to stop the bombing again if we could get any indication
                            of a sincere desire on the part of Hanoi to negotiate. I pointed out
                            that the bombing gave us something to bargain with in peace
                            negotiations. I said that, when we had stopped the bombing, it had
                            permitted North Vietnam to rearm and strengthen her forces at great loss
                            to our men. I pointed out that even when President Johnson had said in
                            his letter to Ho that we would stop the bombing,<note n="4" xml:id="d308fn4">Reference is to a letter delivered February 8
                                offering to end the bombing of the North and stop further increase
                                in U.S. troop levels in South Vietnam in exchange for an end to
                                North Vietnamese infiltration into the South. See <ref target="frus1964-68v05#d32">

                                    Document 32</ref>.</note> the Communists had rejected the offer.
                            His Holiness admitted that North Vietnam appeared unwilling to talk
                            peace, but he still felt that the bombing cost us more in world opinion
                            and moral leadership than it was worth militarily. He qualified his
                            statement by saying that he was not a military man and of course was
                            unable to properly judge military matters.</p>
                        <p>Then the Pope discussed with me what other leaders have talked about:
                            namely, the unbelievably bad press and news coverage that America
                            receives in Europe and elsewhere. He said that it saddened him and that
                            he had a heavy heart for America because the only news was about
                            American killing and bombing.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say he knew that Americans were doing many good things and
                            it was at this point that I told him that I had brought along <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0690"/>a book entitled “The
                            Other War” and a second pamphlet, “The Search for
                            Peace.” I presented a copy of each to the Pope. He was very
                            grateful. He made a point that is worth special attention. He said that
                            very few people in Europe knew anything about what Hanoi and the Viet
                            Cong were doing, that seldom were the cruel attacks of the Viet Cong
                            mentioned in the press or on TV except concerning U.S.-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> direct engagement. America appears to be
                            the aggressor. He said he knew that was not true but that it appears to
                            the person looking at television, listening to the radio and reading the
                            newspapers that big, strong America is being brutal and cruel. He went
                            on to point out that all the news about America in Vietnam came from
                            American sources. He asked this question: Why doesn't the
                            government in Saigon be the spokesman for South Vietnam? Why does
                            America have to be the spokesman? Why doesn't Premier Ky
                            speak up about wanting American help, praising American help, and
                            telling what American help means to South Vietnam? Why don't
                            some of the allies speak up, such as the Philippines or the Australians?
                            In other words, why does all the news have to be the United States doing
                            the talking? This kind of situation leaves the big United States looking
                            like a bully against little North Vietnam. And no one seems to know
                            anything that the Government of South Vietnam is doing. The Pope said
                            that the Government of South Vietnam has very poor public relations.</p>
                        <p>I went on to tell him that it was inevitable that the U.S. press and news
                            services would primarily center their attention on U.S. activities. The
                            Pope said that it would be better for even the military announcements to
                            be made by the South Vietnamese spokesmen, and surely all of the social
                            improvement announcements should come from South Vietnam—at
                            least to the European audience. He was very concerned over this matter
                            and told me at least three times, that I recall, how important it was
                            for us to play down our role and for South Vietnamese spokesmen to be
                            the voice of free Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I told the Pope of President Johnson's visit to
                            Guam—the emphasis upon social action programs. I emphasized
                            the importance of Ambassador Bunker, Ambassador Locke, and Bob Komer
                            going to Vietnam.<note n="5" xml:id="d308fn5">Reference is to Ellsworth
                                Bunker, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Deputy Ambassador Eugene Locke,
                                and Robert Komer, Deputy to General Westmoreland with the personal
                                rank of Ambassador.</note> I reviewed with the Pope Ambassador
                            Bunker's role as a diplomat. He knew Ellsworth Bunker,
                            thought well of him but was pleased to have my assessment.</p>
                        <p>Pope Paul said several times: Don't give up. Don't
                            tire of your tasks. He made it clear that he was not opposed to our
                            being in South Vietnam. He thought we were doing what was right, just as
                            we needed <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0691"/>to be in Europe to
                            help with the defense of Europe. But he was afraid that we might tire in
                            terms of our moral commitment; in other words, we might bow to the
                            pressure of using naked strength rather than being tolerant, patient,
                            and ever searching for peace.</p>
                        <p>The Pope asked if there was anything he could do to be helpful. He
                            repeatedly volunteered his services to us. He said that if I had any
                            message to give to him at any time, he would be pleased to receive it as
                            indeed he would be honored to receive any message from the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I suggested to the Pope that since it was Hanoi who was blocking
                            peace, it would be very helpful to us if on several appropriate
                            occasions he could indicate in some of his messages or statements that
                            Hanoi was causing the continuation of this painful struggle. He said he
                            would do so, but he would have to do it in a moral and spiritual manner
                            and not become too political, whatever this meant.</p>
                        <p>Then he went on to say he thought civilian leaders in other countries
                            ought to speak up on this issue of the reluctance of Hanoi to seek
                            peace. I told him of my conversations with Nenni and Saragat<note n="6" xml:id="d308fn6">See <ref target="#d128">Document 128</ref>.</note>
                            where I had asked these two left-of-center political leaders to get
                            other Social Democrats and Socialists to demand that Hanoi come to the
                            peace table. I reminded the Pope that the United States was always being
                            criticized both at home and abroad, and that I sincerely felt that one
                            of the reasons Hanoi did not come to the peace table was because no real
                            pressure had been brought to bear on her. All the criticism was being
                            heaped on the U.S. and, as long as this continued, Hanoi felt no moral
                            responsibility and felt no pressure of adverse public opinion. He said
                            he would speak to leaders who came to him about this.</p>
                        <p>Papal Encyclical: His Holiness said he knew that parts of his encyclical
                            were controversial, but that it represented the long study and
                            commitment of the Church. He well recalled President
                            Johnson's statements relating to the war on hunger and
                            foreign aid. The Pope gave me a copy of his encyclical as written in
                            Latin and personally autographed. He went through it section by section,
                            seeking my comment.</p>
                        <p>I am sure we have a friend here but, more importantly, I am positive that
                            he is a great man—not only brilliant but compassionate, and
                            one who has a broad knowledge of the forces at work in the world
                            today.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to the Pope, as I did later on to Cardinal <persName corresp="#p_CCAG1">Cicognani</persName>, of President
                            Johnson's commitment to Latin America, the coming trip to
                            Punta del Este,<note n="7" xml:id="d308fn7">April 12-14.</note> and the
                            importance that we attach to the summit <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0692"/>conference. I brought Latin America into the discussion
                            during the time that we were reviewing the encyclical. The Pope was very
                            pleased with the President's leadership on the Latin American
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>I was greatly impressed with the sincerity of this man and his obvious
                            friendship for Americans and the United States. He spoke well of
                            President Johnson's efforts to secure better relationships
                            with Eastern Europe. He encouraged continued efforts by ourselves and
                            the Western European countries to this end.</p>

                        <p>I come to you on the eve of Christmas to discuss the best route to peace
                            in Vietnam, and to explore your thoughts on this subject.</p>
                        <p>You have offered “unarmed cooperation in the reestablishment
                            of true peace.”<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">Reference is to
                                the Pope's December 8 statement welcoming announcement of
                                a bombing pause in Vietnam.</note> I accept that offer with
                            eagerness and an open heart.</p>
                        <p>His Holiness has eloquently expressed the yearning felt by all humanity
                            for peace in Vietnam. My government and people share that yearning. We
                            know it is shared, too, by the people of South Vietnam—and
                            indeed by all men, except a handful of fanatics in a few capitals.</p>
                        <p>Let me express my views on a course of action that has been frequently
                            suggested in recent months. It is said that the United States should
                            once again unilaterally stop the bombing of North Vietnam, with the hope
                            that, somehow, that act of self-denial—together with the
                            pressure of men of good will around the world—might bring the
                            leaders of Hanoi to enter into serious negotiations for a peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>My country has tried this path before. I would not exclude the
                            possibility that it may again appear wise at some point.</p>
                        <p>However, I am bound to say that two factors lead me to a position of the
                            gravest doubt and reserve at the present time.</p>
                        <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0693"/>
                        <p>The first factor is, that such action would cost the lives of many men
                            now fighting against aggression. In every case in the past, cessation of
                            the bombing has been used by the other side to accelerate the movement
                            of supplies and men to the South.</p>
                        <p>For example, in the 37 day pause of 1965-66, I was told by
                            representatives of the Soviet Union that if I could hold a pause for
                            from 12 to 20 days, a serious move to negotiations might result.</p>
                        <p>Their judgment proved wrong. Nevertheless, I extended the pause to thrice
                            12 days. The United States received at the end what can only be
                            described as a brutal diplomatic rebuff.</p>
                        <p>A year ago we worked for three months, through various diplomatic
                            channels, to make the Tet season an occasion for the transition from war
                            to peace.</p>
                        <p>The result was a massive exploitation of that pause by North Vietnam. The
                            forces just above the demilitarized zone were re-supplied. This, in
                            turn, laid the groundwork for a strategy of exerting pressure on the
                            South by violating the demilitarized zone. We suffered great costs from
                            their bad faith during 1967, and we have reason to believe that bad
                            faith will be revived when the weather in that region improves.</p>
                        <p>Your Holiness, I have just today come from Vietnam. My responsible
                            commanders in the field tell me that the North Vietnamese are at this
                            moment taking steps to exploit even the very short pauses agreed to for
                            Christmas, New Year's and Tet.</p>
                        <p>My first reason, then, for rejecting the road of unilateral action and
                            hope for a measured response, is that our experience and current
                            intelligence tell me an increased price will be paid in the blood of my
                            men.</p>
                        <p>But the second factor is even more important. It is my fear that, if
                            Hanoi is free to—and believes it can—improve its
                            military position through a bombing cessation, any talks that might
                            result would be sterile and dilatory on Hanoi's part. The
                            result might well be a step away from peace rather than toward it.</p>
                        <p>These judgments could change as a result of some new sign from Hanoi
                            along the lines I have suggested recently in a San Antonio speech<note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">For text of the President's
                                September 10 speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                                876-881.</note> and several other public addresses. His Holiness
                            should be aware, in confidence, that the suggestions made at that time
                            have been diligently explored through authentic contacts with Hanoi.
                            They have been rebuffed both privately and publicly. I regret to report
                            that Hanoi's present position only reinforces the concerns I
                            have stated above.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0694"/>
                        <p>I have tried repeatedly to interest Hanoi in the possibility of talks,
                            either without conditions, or with the kind of limited unilateral
                            reduction in bombing activity that my government attempted from late
                            December of 1966 through early April of 1967. But there has been no
                            useful response to these suggestions, which indeed go back over a long
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I have been inclined in the last few months to look increasingly
                            toward what might be achieved in the search for peace within South
                            Vietnam itself. It is this in particular that I wish to discuss with His
                            Holiness.</p>
                        <p>The question, of course, involves the so-called National Liberation Front
                            and those individuals now associated with it. I am inclined to make a
                            sharp distinction between these two.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand, we appear to be seeing today a subtle propaganda
                            offensive designed to depict the Front as independent of Hanoi, and as
                            having a position that might contribute to an honorable peace.</p>
                        <p>As to the Front's independence, a great deal of evidence over
                            many years has convinced me that, as an organization, it is, quite
                            simply, an instrument of Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>As to the Front's program, including the new version issued in
                            September and recently circulated at the United Nations, I find myself
                            deeply skeptical that it offers a reasonable peace.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, the program appears to call for a coalition government
                            in South Vietnam, in which the Front would control the levers of
                            power—and, in short order, the whole political structure.
                            Documents captured recently in South Vietnam, and of undoubted
                            authenticity, contain instructions identical to those under which
                            Communist Parties operated in certain Eastern European countries after
                            the Second World War, with tragic results. Again in confidence, I must
                            report that authentic contacts within the past month—with
                            sources intimately familiar with Hanoi and the Front—have
                            produced frank statements that support this gloomy interpretation.</p>
                        <p>Yet, on the other hand, I believe a situation is evolving within South
                            Vietnam that may, at some point, produce real possibilities of movement
                            toward peace through political contacts—not with the Front as
                            an organization, but with individuals now associated with the Front. I
                            referred to this possibility in my television conversation earlier this
                            week.</p>
                        <p>For every reason, I believe such contacts must be primarily the affair of
                            the South Vietnamese government. And, without easy optimism or hopes for
                            immediate success, this is the path that I am inclined to pursue at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>I believe many thoughtful South Vietnamese, including members of the
                            government of South Vietnam, take the same view. President <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0695"/>Thieu and I discussed it in Canberra a
                            few days ago. Although he is understandably cautious, I believe he
                            desires to be constructive if real possibilities should open up.</p>
                        <p>The South Vietnamese are concerned, as talk increases about a solution
                            between Saigon and the “<gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>”, that a highly organized Communist minority,
                            operating as a popular front, might defeat the large—and
                            presently fragmented—non-Communist majority in a political
                            battle.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these views, I believe it important that our influence on
                            the South Vietnamese be exercised in two directions.</p>
                        <p>First, we should encourage the South Vietnamese to find a solution in
                            South Vietnam, understanding all the while the extreme delicacy of the
                            question of “recognizing” the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. I believe President Thieu's
                            formula is useful. He has said that he will talk
                            “informally” with “members”
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Leading anti-Communist figures in South Vietnam, including President
                            Thieu and the newly elected president of the South Vietnamese Senate,
                            Nguyen Van Huyen, for example, might be encouraged to look in this
                            direction. For peace will require some form of reconciliation among
                            those who live their lives in that country. Peace can best be achieved
                            by South Vietnamese, for South Vietnam, in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Second, I believe those who have some influence in South Vietnam must
                            encourage the South Vietnamese to organize the great anti-Communist
                            majority into some sort of effective national political coalition.</p>
                        <p>As I look ahead, it seems to me inevitable that some day the Communists,
                            having abandoned war, will seek power in South Vietnam through political
                            means. Those who have resisted Communism on the battlefield must be
                            prepared to resist it at the polls. The continued fragmentation of the
                            vast non-Communist majority could result in a tragedy which would render
                            fruitless all the courage and suffering that have gone into the struggle
                            so far.</p>
                        <p>It would be good if Your Holiness' influence in South Vietnam,
                            as well as mine and all others who can help, could continue to be used
                            to help overcome the inherited factionalism of South Vietnamese
                            political life so that this gallant but suffering people could face
                            their political future with confidence and with the knowledge that the
                            Communists would not be capable of defeating them at the ballot box.</p>
                        <p>If these thoughts conform to your own knowledge and insight, you could,
                            in your New Year's statement on the Day of Peace, speak
                            directly to the South Vietnamese. You could urge those now working with
                            the Viet Cong to abandon the dream of conquering their country through
                            terror and aggression. You could urge them to turn to the path of
                            national reconciliation; and you could call on those who now fight in
                            this little country to turn their thoughts and energies to the needs of
                            the people.</p>
                        <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>I should also like to call Your Holiness' attention to a
                            matter of intense concern to the American people. I refer to the fate
                            and welfare of American prisoners of war held in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We have just learned that Christmas packages sent to the men by their
                            families in America have been rejected and returned by Hanoi. Mail to
                            and from the prisoners has been severely limited. Requests by the
                            International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the prisoners have
                            been repeatedly rebuffed by North Vietnam, nor has a list of names of
                            prisoners been provided. These are all basic rights of prisoners of war
                            stated in the Geneva Convention, to which North Vietnam has adhered.</p>
                        <p>Your Holiness might be willing to offer to send a representative to North
                            Vietnam, and to talk with the government there about the condition of
                            the prisoners. I feel sure the government of South Vietnam would
                            willingly agree to a visit by your representatives to prisoners in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>On the eve of Christmas, when Christians—and men of other
                            faiths—are touched by a divine spirit, I have come round the
                            world to ask your help—and to pledge that I shall not cease
                            to struggle for a stable and honorable peace.</p>

                            took place.</p>
                        <p>President: I was impressed with the December statement of his Holiness
                            and of his recent reply to the College of Cardinals.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">December 8 and 15. For texts of the

                            issues.</p>
                        <p>I have just come from Australia where I talked with practically all the
                            leaders of the Asian world.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">The President
                                had been in Australia to attend the funeral of Prime Minister Harold
                                Holt, December 21.</note> We feel we are ready to stop the fighting
                            immediately but we can't stop just half a war; we must stop
                            it all. <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0697"/>Hanoi has great
                            problems but they believe the U.S. will tire and fail just like France
                            did—and then they can win by default what they lost on the
                            battlefield. We are being extremely careful not to widen the war by
                            bringing in China and Russia.</p>
                        <p>One half of our people want to do more. Twenty percent of our people want
                            to pull out. Thirty percent follow the moderate course of the
                            President—thus 80 percent of the U.S. either follows the
                            President or wants to do more. Twenty percent make all the noise and
                            mislead Hanoi into believing we will give up.</p>
                        <p>So I have this problem of keeping the pressure on without widening a war.
                            My right hand keeps the pressure steady and with my left hand we seek
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Here it seems is where the Holy Father can play a great part.</p>
                        <p>Pope: I want the President to know that I have not only given counsel to
                            South Vietnam but I have scolded the North for not making moves toward
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>President: I think your statements have been fair and just. I want to
                            express the hope that with President Thieu and the new Senate President
                            the Holy Father may be able to persuade them to begin informal talks
                            with some of those associated with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>. Ultimately South Vietnam must settle its problems in
                            South Vietnam—a settlement on the basis of one
                            man—one vote constitutional government. Then the U.S. can
                            come home just as we did in Europe and in Asia and spend the money we
                            are expending on war on education, health, and all the other needs of
                            our people.</p>
                        <p>(At this point the President gave to the Pope and to Cardinal <persName corresp="#p_CCAG1">Cicognani</persName> copies of a proposed press
                            release dealing with this conference. The Pope objected to a line near
                            the end of the release which said “We will never surrender
                            South Vietnam to aggression or attack.” The Pope said that if
                            this line were in the release it would appear that the Pope was
                            endorsing war.<note n="4" xml:id="d310fn4">For text of the final press

                                    303</ref>.</note> The five points that you outlined before you
                            left on your trip were very good. I understand very well the situation
                            of the U.S. today. You went to South Vietnam to protect and defend a
                            small country and now you are engaged in a great war. We must declare
                            our own position to the world as friends of peace and foes of war. I
                            must differentiate my position from yours although I very clearly
                            understand <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0698"/>your good intentions
                            and your good hopes. I want to further the solidarity of my agreement
                            with your intentions but you must understand I can never agree to
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the methods you are now using will not arrive at your expected
                            goal. North Vietnam will not cease its activities—especially
                            when it has great powers supporting it. I do not believe the war will
                            end but I do believe that its character can change, becoming a defensive
                            rather than an offensive one.</p>
                        <p>President: Does His Holiness believe that Soviet Russia wants this war to
                            continue?</p>
                        <p>Pope: It is difficult to say but when Podgorny was here he told me that
                            Russia would never abandon the cause of North Vietnam. I tried to
                            convince him that this was the proper time to collaborate with the U.S.
                            in peace moves but I received negative results.</p>
                        <p>Is there some way the U.S. could give an impression of a change in the
                            character of this war to gain world favor? I am hurt and saddened that
                            the U.S. moral position is injured by world opinion.</p>
                        <p>In talking with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d310fn6">See <ref target="#d308">Document
                                308</ref>.</note> I reminded him that the U.S. has great missions
                            that it performs as the guardian of freedom. Your Great Society programs
                            are applauded. But the Vietnam episode colors all this.</p>
                        <p>What can I do to come to your aid? We will continue to preach peace and
                            to be witness to your good intentions. Might it be possible for the U.S.
                            to give new examples of its generosity?</p>
                        <p>I have received messages from great personages of the world to plead with
                            you to stop the bombing. The Church cannot give its approval to bombing
                            as a means of defending liberty. Is there anybody that we can contact as
                            an intermediary—the only one we know is the Commission and
                            that is very weak.</p>
                        <p>Can I be an intermediary for you—I could say that I know that
                            what the U.S. says is true—that it truly wants peace. Can you
                            give me your assurances of this?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes, of course, and this statement that we have read says it
                            too.</p>
                        <p>Cardinal <persName corresp="#p_CCAG1">Cicognani</persName>: But Hanoi
                            refuses to talk. How can we overcome this?</p>
                        <p>President: We have stopped bombing five times but this only increases the
                            murder. Now we are hopeful that South Vietnam and representatives of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> can talk and settle their
                            differences locally.</p>
                        <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>Pope: May I say this to the Russians: I have discussed all of this with
                            President Johnson and he wants very much to stop this war. What will you
                            do? May I say this to the Russians and use your name?</p>
                        <p>President: Yes. What you would be saying is essentially what the
                                Aide-Memoire<note n="7" xml:id="d310fn7">

                            both agree that the Aide-Memoire should not be made public.</p>

                            stopped the bombing, negotiations could get started. We said that we
                            would stop the bombing if talks would get started. He said that he would
                            talk to North Vietnam. When we received no word from him, we asked our
                            Ambassador to press him for some kind of report. Finally <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said “You are still
                            bombing and nothing can be done.” Thus he slammed the door on
                            us. We believe that he talked to North Vietnam and they told him no. We
                            never publicized this.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> met earlier with
                                <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Wilson</persName>,<note n="9" xml:id="d310fn9">February 6-13.</note> he said he wanted to get
                            talks started but North Vietnam said no then also. We know that China
                            and Russia are supporting and will continue to support Hanoi. We think
                            the Russians would like the hostilities to stop because they
                            don't want a confrontation. But I am not sure of this. </p>
                        <p>Pope: Unhappily, the U.S. is more exposed to propaganda than the Russians
                            are. Please continue these appeals. Patience is needed. Everything you
                            do for peace I will support.</p>
                        <p>President: Hanoi is simply not going to the conference table because
                            Hanoi believes they will win this war in Washington. It will take a long
                            time to prove but I am convinced the best avenue available to us now is
                            in the South—talks informally between the Thieu government
                            and representatives of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Pope: Your suggestion for South Vietnam is good. I will encourage it.</p>
                        <p>President: It seems to me that if South Vietnam's government
                            would more or less leave us and talk informally with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>—and thereby the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> leave Hanoi—this could be a
                            way for South Vietnam to settle its own fate and have Hanoi and the U.S.
                            pull away.</p>
                        <p>Pope: This is all very good but it will take time.</p>
                        <p>President: We must begin. It would be very useful if the Pope through his
                            sources in South Vietnam could persuade Thieu and others to talk to the
                                <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> informally. Anything the Holy
                            Father can do to <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0700"/>encourage this
                            will be very beneficial. This would be one effective way of disengaging
                            the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> from Hanoi—and South
                            Vietnam from us.</p>
                        <p>I am also very hopeful the Pope will send a representative to see our
                            prisoners in North Vietnam and to see the prisoners being held in South
                            Vietnam. Hanoi is ignoring and violating the Geneva convention prisoner
                            rules. If the Pope can call on both sides to accord just and humane
                            treatment to prisoners and ask for permission to visit both sides, we
                            would be willing to open our doors immediately.</p>
                        <p>Pope: I urge you to have patience and perseverance in seeking peace. I
                            believe it important for you to give new aspects to this
                            war—to make it a more defensive war instead of an offensive
                            war. It will strengthen your moral position in the world. You are now
                            being accused of being unjust. You can make the same propaganda yourself
                            by changing the war.</p>
                        <p>(At this point the President went over the press release again with the
                            Pope. The President said that he would strike the sentence that the Pope
                            felt was a bit objectionable. The Pope and the Cardinal both agreed that
                            this would meet their approval.)</p>
                        <p>Cardinal <persName corresp="#p_CCAG1">Cicognani</persName>: With whom
                            should Thieu and the new Senate President talk?</p>
                        <p>President: Thieu is a good man—honest—and a
                            Catholic. As you know, the Catholics are in a minority in South Vietnam.
                            In the recent election, a new Senate was voted in and a Catholic was
                            elected as President of the Senate. They are both men of strength and
                            firmness. I hope the Pope will encourage them to talk (and here the
                            President smiled and gestured to the Pope) just as the Pope encouraged
                            me to pass my education bills. We are now spending $9 billion more on
                            education. And the Pope can claim some responsibility for this.</p>
                        <p>(The Pope smiled and offered his hands in gesture of affection for the
                            President.)</p>
                        <p>Pope: I am hopeful that you will exploit every possibility that will lead
                            to peace.</p>
                        <p>President: I want to do what I think is the best thing to
                            do—to get the South Vietnamese to handle the problems of
                            South Vietnam. We have a story in Texas about Ford automobiles carrying
                            a slogan on the trunk of each car that said “Made in Texas by
                            Texans for Texans.” My motto now is “Peace in
                            South Vietnam for South Vietnam and by South Vietnamese.”</p>
                        <p>What I would hope that the Pope would do is this: Through your Apostolic
                            Delegate or other effective channels tell Thieu and the Senate President
                            to talk to representatives of the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss>
                            and to do it in their own way. If the Pope would do this, I strongly
                            believe it would offer some chance of peace.</p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0701"/>
                        <p>Pope: I think I can do something.</p>
                        <p>President: You can say that President Thieu is willing to have informal
                            discussions, why not you?</p>
                        <p>Pope: Is it possible that the truce of Christmas could be extended by a
                            day or two? Could you not show the world that on the day of peace
                            January 1 you will also make this a day of truce?</p>
                        <p>President: My problem is this: My military leaders tell me that the North
                            Vietnamese have trucks lined up bumper to bumper and as soon as the
                            truce begins they start them moving and those supplies and those men
                            kill our soldiers. On August 25 I told Hanoi we would draw a circle
                            around it of three hundred miles and if we stopped bombing there could
                            talks begin?</p>
                        <p>On September 10 at San Antonio I made my speech which publicized a
                            portion of this.</p>
                        <p>I held back until October 25—and during that time they kept
                            coming and they kept killing. Archbishop Lucey went to South Vietnam as
                            one of my observers during the election. He told me that every time we
                            quietened down they increase their pressure. In the 37 day bombing
                            pause, they built up a seven months supply.</p>
                        <p>Pope: Where do they get their men, their means, their materiel?</p>
                        <p>President: By terror they are recruiting in the South—and they
                            are now down to 14 year old boys. They are getting desperate and we are
                            certain that we are hurting them very very much. They are using Kamikaze
                            tactics for they desperately want a victory and they are unable to
                            achieve one.</p>
                        <p>Pope: We shall pray for you and we shall pray for your efforts for
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>President: Is it agreeable now for me to release this statement with the
                            one sentence removed?</p>
                        <p>(The Pope nodded his head and said “Yes, it was
                            agreeable.”)</p>
                        <p>I don't want to press the point but I did want to know if I
                            can assume that the Pope will try to bring the South Vietnamese to
                            informal talks—and will immediately help out the prisoner
                            problem. (The Pope nodded.)</p>
                        <p>Pope: Would you have any objection to receiving an aide-memoire from me
                            which would set forth my views? I want you to know that we will follow
                            the same theme as we have before. I assure you of my loyalty and
                            devotion to the ideals that the U.S. stands for.</p>
                        <p>President: Will the Pope be helpful in getting the South Vietnamese to
                            talk informally with the <gloss target="#t_NLF1">NLF</gloss> along the
                            lines I have outlined?</p>
                        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0702"/>
                        <p>Pope: I will do whatever is possible. I will study the prisoner situation
                            and see what contacts can be made. This is a cause which is close to my
                            heart.</p>

                        <p>I was deeply touched by your compassionate message of condolence upon the

                        <p>Senator Kennedy believed that Americans could, if they would, end the
                            blight of poverty and bigotry. In this he was at one with the political
                            leadership the United States has enjoyed for the past thirty-five
                            years.</p>
                        <p>I must report that there has been no substantial progress toward a
                            peaceful and just solution of the war in Vietnam during the Paris
                                talks.<note n="4" xml:id="d311fn4">The Paris peace talks began on
                                May 13.</note> Meanwhile, the Communists have mounted a savage,
                            indiscriminate attack on Saigon—on the government of South
                            Vietnam and on ordinary citizens alike.</p>
                        <p>There is much speculation that these rocket and mortar attacks are
                            designed not only to shake the government, but to give the impression
                            that the Communists hold the military initiative—and
                            therefore to secure an advantage in Paris. It is a
                            tragedy—one of many in this war—that the people of
                            South Vietnam must suffer as they do because of the aggressive
                            intentions of the Communists.</p>
                        <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>I cannot predict when the North Vietnamese representatives will be more
                            forthcoming in Paris; nor can I estimate how long the
                            Communists' offensive will continue in South Vietnam. I fear
                            that neither will occur as soon as all mankind desires.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the United States and those with whom we are allied will
                            continue to seek an honorable peace at the negotiating table, as we
                            shall remain firm in resisting terror and aggression in South Vietnam. I
                            devoutly hope that my next letter to you will bring more hopeful
                            tidings. Unless it is myself, I know of no one on earth who so longs for
                            news of progress toward peace in Vietnam as Your Holiness.</p>

                        <p>We are most grateful to you, Mr. President, for receiving Our messenger
                            and explaining your thoughts concerning the visit We hoped to make to
                                Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">No correspondence was found on

                        </p>
                        <p>Our efforts have, unfortunately, met with a negative response, to the
                            effect that, “because of the war, the conditions necessary to
                            receive <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>s in the Democratic Republic of
                            Vietnam are lacking.” Consequently, after studying all the
                            factors involved, We have decided that We must cancel even Our planned
                            visit to South Vietnam. Such a gesture might not favor the cause of
                            peace, which We so ardently desire, and might even aggravate the
                            situation. We also feel that it is necessary to preclude any hostile
                            acts, which following on the negative answer of the Hanoi Government,
                            could take place on the occasion of Our visit, causing the sacrifice of
                            many innocent persons. We cannot permit that Our presence should be the
                            cause of further suffering for a people already tried by many years of
                            tragic war.</p>

                        <p>You may be assured, Mr. President, that Our efforts for peace will not be
                            lessened as a result of the reply received; they will in fact be
                            increased, in order that the day may be hastened when peace and its
                            resultant benefits will be the lot of men in every part of the
                            world.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> 82324. Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> and I discussed at length this morning the
                            question of a prompt reply to the Pope.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">The
                                Pope's letter is <ref target="#d312">Document
                                312</ref>.</note> There was no agreed conclusion, but these points
                            emerged.</p>
                        <p>1. In general, we felt that we ought to wait a week or so before making a
                            major substantive initiative on Vietnam to see where the attack on
                            Saigon, etc., comes out. So far as Moscow was concerned it was also felt
                            some time should pass before raising the Vietnam question.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to the Pope as a channel for a serious communication,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clark Clifford</persName> had the
                            strongest possible reservations: in part because it would undercut
                                Paris,<note n="3" xml:id="d313fn3">Reference is to the ongoing Paris
                                peace talks.</note> but even more because it would undercut the
                            possibility of using the Russians if we planned something like his
                                (<persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>'s)
                            proposal. He feels that if we surface our hard, minimum terms via the
                            Pope, it would be difficult to engage the Russians. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> explained the underlying reasons
                            for our desire to keep a channel open and active in Rome. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> recommends that we draft a
                            friendly reply to the Pope which would not, however, use him as the
                            channel for communicating our minimum terms for stage two.</p>
                        <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, on the other
                            hand, has grave reservations about <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName>'s proposition; that is, the
                            President launching a public bombing cessation, on the basis of what we
                            assume, without first exploring it via Paris.</p>
                        <p>4. We talked at length about whether we would settle for a firm <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> proposition, with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and I feeling that it would be
                            wholly satisfactory if it were firmly nailed down. <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> was less certain.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to a total bombing halt on the assumption of what Hanoi
                            might do, it was agreed that the critical question was whether the
                            President felt he would be able politically to go back to bombing if the
                            assumption was not fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>We shall meet again for lunch on Tuesday at 12:30 P.M. and hope to have
                            something more lucid for you to consider upon your return.<note n="4" xml:id="d313fn4">No further documentation relating to communications

                            course of a talk with ExtAff Minister Martin yesterday and at lunch
                            today with the Prime Minister I was given to understand that they had
                            not only backed away from the idea of any institutional arrangements but
                            also were not prepared to agree upon a declaration of principles to be
                            signed and made public in connection with the President's
                            meeting with the Prime Minister. Martin put forward much the same
                            reasons as Minister <persName corresp="#p_RHB1">Robinson</persName> had
                            as recorded in the memorandum of conversation of January 4.<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">Not found.</note> The Prime Minister speaking more
                            frankly evinced no great personal enthusiasm in the institutional idea
                            and was impressed by the difficulties of drawing up principles that
                            would meet the test of time or as he phrased it at one point
                            “not be able to be used by one party against the
                            other.”</p>
                        <p>Needless to say this led to a discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_GWL1">Gordon</persName> budget measures which was
                            disquieting in terms of possible future Canadian action. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_GWL1">Gordon</persName> had returned from his December 5
                            meeting with the Economic Club of Chicago sure that after he had
                            explained to the represented Chicago business community the reasoning
                            behind his proposals they had acquiesced and Pearson implied that
                            further measures were in preparation. Of course I expressed skepticism
                            about the persuasive effect of eloquence on American industry whether
                            located in the Chicago area or elsewhere to acquiesce in unprovoked,
                            injurious and discriminatory measures against it to be reflected in
                            balance sheets. I urged that the reconsideration that he had promised
                            take the direction of removing injurious discrimination against existing
                            American capital which had come into Canada under national treatment and
                            that the change in the rules, if any, be directed towards future
                            takeover or other forms of future foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>I will report further details of this conversation when I go to
                            Washington next week; the purpose of the second paragraph of this

                        <p>While President Johnson and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> were talking together in President
                            Johnson's office,<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">No record of
                                this private talk was found.</note> the Under Secretary proposed to
                            Mr. Martin that they discuss certain subjects of mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> mentioned the intention
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> to
                            recognize Communist China.<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">France extended
                                diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China
                                on January 27.</note> He said it looked as though this were now
                            inevitable, <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0708"/>and that this could
                            “upset a few apple carts.” He said that according
                            to our information <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                            probably intended to make an announcement, and then go into the matter
                            further in his press conference. Mr. Martin said that this indeed seemed
                            to be the case. He said he thought that, however disagreeable such a
                            development was bound to be for the United States, he hoped that the
                            United States Government would not unduly dramatize the occasion by
                            reacting too violently. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> what he thought would be the effect on Southeast
                            Asia and the Far East generally of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that it would be considered
                            by Saigon as a clear indication of a trend toward some kind of
                            neutralist solution in Southeast Asia, and that this would gravely
                            affect the morale of the government and people of South Viet Nam and
                            thus hamper current United States efforts to help the Vietnamese to
                            achieve victory over Communism. He said the United States reaction would
                            undoubtedly be very severe. It would also seriously complicate the
                            situation in the United Nations, in the event that African and other
                            countries followed France's lead. He said that President
                            Johnson was concerned by what the position of the Canadian Government
                            would be in the United Nations on the recognition issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said that the Canadian Government felt that there was much to
                            be said for the basic premises underlying <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s views. He said it was not possible to
                            isolate Communist China forever. He said that contacts had already been
                            established between Ottawa and Peiping. As an example he cited the
                            forthcoming exchange between the Canadian Press Agency and the New China
                            News Agency, whereby each would have a representative in the
                            other's country. He said it was important to watch carefully
                            how things would develop. The Canadian Government was fully aware of the
                            possible implications of the French move for the United States and for
                            the Alliance as a whole. He could not at this time say what the evolving
                            posture and attitude of the Canadian Government would be in the future.
                            He could not honestly say now what the Canadian Government would do
                            eventually in the General Assembly. He hoped that such a situation would
                            not arise until after November. He said that Canada wanted to establish
                            increasing contacts with China because it sincerely felt that it was not
                            a practical or farsighted policy to continue to ignore the Chinese
                            indefinitely. Mr. Martin went on to say that when he had talked with
                            French Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Couve de
                                Murville</persName> in Paris,<note n="4" xml:id="d315fn4">They
                                apparently met during the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>
                                Ministerial meeting December 13-18, 1963.</note> he had not said as
                            much as he had just said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. He did say to Couve that he hoped that the French
                            Government would carefully weigh the effect on the Alliance <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0709"/>and on the US attitude of its proposed
                            action. However he had not told the French that what they intended to do
                            was wrong. He said the Prime Minister and he had told the French that
                            the Canadian Government at this present time had not changed its policy
                            on the question of recognition of Communist China, or with regard to
                            Communist Chinese admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that it was still
                            not clear what Taiwan planned to do if France recognized Peiping.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said he was pessimistic on the chances of survival of the
                            present government in South Viet Nam. He said that it did not enjoy the
                            confidence of the Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> refuted this assertion
                            and went on to say that an attempt to find a neutralist solution in that
                            part of the world would be tantamount to facilitating a take-over by the
                            Chinese Communists. He pointed out that the circumstances which had made
                            desirable a solution of neutrality for Laos were peculiar to that
                            country, and did not constitute a precedent for a neutrality formula for
                            South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> for his
                            opinion about the Soviet proposal for a conference on Cambodia in
                                April.<note n="5" xml:id="d315fn5">On January 22 the Soviet Union
                                forwarded to its Co-Chairman, the United Kingdom, a request from
                                Cambodia for convening the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            said that we preferred not to have such a conference, but that we did
                            not want to seem to be in direct opposition to Sihanouk's
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that there
                            were two points which could together be extremely harmful for the US
                            attitude toward the United Nations: first, financial problems in
                            relation to Article 19 and, second, a vote in the United Nations to
                            admit Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin asked whether the United States did not think that a
                            Soviet-Chicom confrontation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            would be to the advantage of the Free World. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he doubted this, since they
                            would probably tend to get together on major issues. Mr. Martin asked
                            whether the French initiative would swing the balance in the United
                            Nations in favor of the admission of Communist China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that this would not
                            necessarily be the case. He said the French Government had advised its
                            former colonies in Africa that it would be desirable they should not
                            recognize Communist China when France does so. He said that there would
                            be an obvious reluctance on the part of most of those governments to
                            have a representative of Peiping in their capitals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said that Canada was recognizing Outer Mongolia, and that some
                            people in Canada would say that this was a move towards recognizing the
                            Chinese People's Republic. Mr. Martin referred to the action
                            of 1955 to admit Outer Mongolia to the United Nations. He said <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0710"/>he recalled that the United
                            States had favored this, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concurred, indicating that it was part of a package
                            transaction.</p>
                        <p>(Later, with the Prime Minister present.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that while the
                            President and the Prime Minister had been having their private
                            conversation the rest of the group had discussed <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and Peiping. The Prime
                            Minister said that he had also talked about this with the President. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that if
                            there should develop a trend in favor of Chinese recognition in the
                            United Nations, at the same time as a discussion of Article 19 of the
                            United Nations Charter, it could generate a wave of public opinion
                            against the United Nations in the United States. The Prime Minister said
                            that the President and he shared the view that nobody can do anything
                            with de Gaulle once he has made up his mind, and that the best course in
                            the situation is to minimize the importance of it, as far as public
                            treatment is concerned. The Prime Minister went on to say that he hoped
                            that the recognition of Communist China by France would not have a
                            drastic effect. He said in the long run it might be helpful if the
                            arrangement results in providing a transition toward a two-China
                            situation. He said the President had agreed that it was not desirable to
                            exaggerate the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> spoke of the concern over
                            a possible trend among African states toward recognition and said that
                            we do not want to allow this sort of thing to be built up. We understand
                            that the French Government has suggested the <gloss target="#t_UAM1">UAM</gloss> states not follow the French example. The Prime
                            Minister remarked that the French must lack confidence in their own
                            action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that some
                                <gloss target="#t_UAM1">UAM</gloss> states may resist the temptation
                            to recognize Communist China. He said we certainly hope for a firm line
                            on the Western side, and we are particularly concerned over the reaction
                            in Viet Nam. Certainly the French action would be interpreted in Viet
                            Nam as a further move in the wrong direction.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister wondered whether the greatest embarrassment would be
                            in Tokyo, and the Under Secretary said it was doubtful whether the
                            Japanese could stand against great pressure to do the same thing. Mr.
                            Martin referred to a speech by the Japanese Prime Minister of the
                            preceding day, reported in January 22nd issue of the New York Times, in
                            which the problem was reviewed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we have advised Taiwan to sit tight.
                            There may be no actual exchange of ambassadors between Communist China
                            and France for about three months. The situation is hard for Chiang
                            Kai-shek, because the French have never permitted him to have an
                            ambassador in Paris, only a Chargé. If there is to be a
                            Chinese ambassador, and only a Chargé for the Nationalists,
                            this would be very awkward indeed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it had been reported in the newspapers,
                            particularly in Canada, that he had told the President that Canada <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0711"/>would not recognize Red China
                            without United States consent. This type of newspaper story is
                            exceedingly damaging and he had had to deny it on domestic political
                            grounds. He said he felt the world must some day get out of the
                            difficult situation in which it has painted itself, but that he had no
                            wish whatsoever to add to the difficulties of the United States,
                            especially in an election year. He said that some pressure would develop
                            in Canada but he did not want to do anything now to add to United States
                            difficulties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it
                            might be wise to see what happened as a result of French recognition.
                            After all the British had not gained very much by having diplomatic
                            representation in Peiping. Mr. Martin said that this was the sort of
                            thing the Japanese Prime Minister had suggested—wait and see
                            what happened.</p>
                        <p>At one point during the meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWH1">Brubeck</persName>, who had been absent from the room briefly,
                            returned to say that the press was inquiring whether it was true that
                            Canada and the United States were discussing the possible recognition of
                            Red China by Canada. The Prime Minister authorized a statement to the
                            effect that this subject had not been considered in the
                                discussions.<note n="6" xml:id="d315fn6">For text of the joint

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there was a
                            considerable problem over the Canadian auto parts measures. He said we
                            might not be able to keep from levying countervailing duties. He noted
                            that the Treasury had already obtained <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0712"/>a number of complaints, and many companies are alleging
                            that their businesses have been adversely affected by the Canadian
                            policy. Concern has developed in the Congress. A company has the right
                            to make use of its legal remedies, and the courts would have to decide
                            whether the Canadian measure is or is not a subsidy. Our lawyers think
                            it is.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said that previously the Canadian view of the problems of
                            secondary industry was that the plan for automobiles could be followed
                            in other industries—this however turned out not to be
                            possible, and there was no intention of applying it. He said he thought
                            some United States people might be exaggerating the effects of the
                            Canadian measures. For example, Studebaker had made a decision which
                            probably would have been made anyway, without the Canadian measures.
                            Studebaker has a simpler and more efficient operation in Canada, and it
                            gave them some opportunity to stay in business.<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">Reference is to the decision of the Studebaker
                                Company to move some of its auto parts production to Canada.</note>
                            Mr. Martin hoped that our perspective and view of mutual interest would
                            lead us to discourage the idea of countervailing duties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we were getting a
                            crescendo of complaints from parts manufacturers in the United States,
                            and there was active Congressional interest, and there would no doubt be
                            speeches in Congress. From the point of view of the United States
                            Government it was difficult to explain a shift of production from the
                            United States to Canada when United States unemployment is worse than
                            Canada's and when our balance of payments situation is also
                            worse than Canada's.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said he thought the parts people would in due course do a lot
                            of business, and that the total result would not be inimical to the
                            parts industry in the United States. Canadian interests are also
                            affected, and there are complaints from people in Canada. Mr. Martin
                            referred to the television interview he had given in September and to
                            the United States concern over it. He said it should be remembered that
                            what a politician says is only good for twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName> noted that
                            the Canadian measure was encouraging United States investment in
                            Canadian production facilities, and Mr. Martin said that they did not
                            mind further investment. The Ambassador remarked that we did not want to
                            increase our investment in Canada necessarily; we were more interested
                            in having existing investment treated fairly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> wondered if there would
                            be Canadian interest in establishing a joint group to examine the auto
                            industry on a continental basis, to see what might be done of a broad
                            and general nature. Mr. Martin <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0713"/>said he had had no opportunity to discuss this with his colleague Mr.
                            Drury. There was no objection to consultation, but the policy had been
                            announced and was in effect, and there could not be much thought of
                            changing it.</p>
                        <p>(Later, with Prime Minister Pearson present.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested the question of
                            a joint study of the auto industry to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, and the response came from Mr. Martin, to the
                            effect that Canada has given exhaustive attention to all possible
                            alternatives. Mr. Martin said it would be regrettable if the impression
                            got around that changes were likely, since the policy has been announced
                            and is in effect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he felt it necessary
                            to make two points: one, that Congress is getting disturbed and that
                            there will be speeches and consequent excitement. The second point is
                            that some company may apply for the application of countervailing
                            duties, and this may release a chain of events which we cannot control.
                            Mr. Martin said no subsidy was involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that there is a real possibility that the
                            courts in the United States might find that there was.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said that there had
                            been quite a talk about this between him and the President, particularly
                            on the Studebaker case. He said he had explained to the President that
                            the Studebaker situation would have existed just the same. He said the
                            President seemed worried over a possible flood of cheap cars from Canada
                            but he thought he had reassured the President on this point. He had
                            explained the structure of Canadian car costs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked that the Studebaker
                            letter to its suppliers had been terrible, in that it sounded like that
                            of a politician. He went on to say that the formulation is not
                            applicable to other industries, and that Mr. Drury had said it could be
                            used only in an industry that was American-controlled.</p>

                            Arctic archipelago but insisted on claiming all other straits and bays
                            on both the East and West Coasts, as well as the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
                            as internal waters. They seemed to admit that the position we have taken
                            offering to acquiesce in a 12-mile fishing zone, measured in a valid
                            manner from the coast and straight base lines, meets the larger part of
                            their fishing problems, and that their claims to most of these other
                            waters are of doubtful international legality. However, in effect the
                            Minister took the position that, as domestic political commitments had
                            been made by Canadian leaders on these more exaggerated claims, it would
                            be politically impossible to give them up and hoped that the United
                            States would bail them out of their problem by not protesting their
                            action. Deputy Under Secretary Johnson pointed out the impossibility of
                            our doing this because of the precedents it would set elsewhere for
                            freedom of the seas, particularly off Soviet coasts, and made the
                            suggestion of a non-contentious (i.e. friendly) suit in the
                            International Court of Justice.<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">Instructions

                        <p>I have approved your proposed presentation to the Canadians regarding
                            possible application of countervailing duties on auto parts and creation
                            of a joint task force for dealing with the problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">Apparent reference to papers on U.S. tariff

                        <p>In view of the difficult economic and political issues involved, I think
                            it essential that we do everything possible to find an agreed solution
                            that does not require countervailing duties. Before final determination
                            of the legal issue on duties, therefore, I would appreciate a report on
                            the status of discussions with Canada and of prospects for a mutually
                            satisfactory alternative solution to this problem.</p>

                        <p>As acting Chairman of the U.S. Delegation at the 9th meeting of the Joint
                            U.S.-Canadian Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs held in Ottawa, I
                            submit the following report. The entire meeting was attended by
                            Secretaries Udall, Freeman, Hodges and <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. Chairman Heller and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> attended for the first day,

                            of the second day. The Canadian Delegation was headed by the Secretary
                            of State for External Affairs, and included the Ministers of Finance,
                            Trade and Commerce, Agriculture, and Industry, plus the Governor of the
                            Bank of Canada and the Chief Canadian Trade Negotiator.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was characterized by a far greater spirit of cooperation and
                            understanding than had characterized our first meeting with the present
                            Canadian Government in September.<note n="2" xml:id="d319fn2">Documentation on the 8th meeting of the Joint U.S.-Canadian

                                2311.</note> The Canadians made a point both privately and publicly
                            of improved relations with the United States. This is of course
                            accurate, but it also reflects the interesting conclusion that, while
                            the present government retains the traditional Canadian sensitivity on
                            matters of national pride, they now apparently consider it good politics
                            in Canada to play up their success in improving relations with the U.S.
                            This is in sharp contrast to the previous Canadian Government which
                            found it expedient to make U.S.-Canadian relations appear worse than
                            they really were.</p>
                        <p>All items except two were handled without any disagreement of importance.
                            Full agreement was reached on parallel positions to be followed at the
                            May 4 meeting of <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and on the
                            general approach to the Kennedy Round.</p>
                        <p>One item that might lead to serious difficulties in the future is the
                            regulations recently promulgated by the Department of Commerce
                            concerning the control of the export of technical data. It was obvious
                            that certain U.S. exporters have over-reacted to the intent of this
                            regulation which was published on April 1. Commerce will undertake a
                            broad campaign to eliminate this misunderstanding. Nevertheless, some
                            serious problems may remain and this matter still has the potentiality
                            of causing major difficulties in our overall relations with Canada.
                            Accordingly, State will join with Commerce in a careful reevaluation of
                            the substance of these rather extensive and hitherto unpublicized
                            controls.</p>
                        <p>The second matter on which no agreement was reached was auto parts. The
                            Canadians were prepared for a vigorous counterattack on our views based
                            on economic arguments and looking to the substance of the problem.
                            However, they found no answer to the legal arguments <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0717"/>we put forth regarding the necessity of
                            initiating action under our countervailing duty procedures. They
                            accepted with good grace our decision to proceed as a matter of legal
                            necessity. They showed no give whatsoever on the substance and
                            originally refused to even consider joint working level talks looking to
                            a possible solution. However, when they realized that a public
                            proceeding would soon begin in the U.S., they agreed privately that
                            joint technical studies should be undertaken immediately by a working
                            party. Publicly they maintained their position of no give. It is too
                            early to predict whether they will in fact eventually agree on anything
                            of substance. It is also clear that our decision to proceed with public
                            hearings, under our countervailing duty law, was the only reason they
                            agreed to substantive consideration of the matter by a working party.
                            The Department of Commerce will head up the U.S. side in these
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>It is noteworthy that despite the disagreement on this item, which is of
                            considerable political importance to the Canadian Government, the
                            Canadians continued to talk about improved economic and overall
                            relations with the U.S. and publicly labelled our meeting a great
                            success.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister began by talking briefly and lightly
                            about immediate problems of politics in their two countries. The
                            President gave the Prime Minister greetings from Senator Magnuson, and
                            the Prime Minister commented wryly on the problems of lumber and fish.
                            The Prime Minister explained the great political difficulty and <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0718"/>importance of changing the
                            national flag of Canada, and the President remarked that he had as many
                            troubles as he wanted, too.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to Southeast Asia. The Prime Minister opened
                            by saying that in his brief conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">No record of this conversation was
                                found.</note> he had agreed on the importance of sending Mr. Seaborn
                            to Vietnam as soon as possible, and he made it clear that he thought
                            this could be arranged in the coming week. He spoke warmly of Mr.
                            Seaborn's qualifications, and made clear his entire readiness
                            to have a Canadian officer play this important role of reporting
                            accurately the purposes of the United States Government and the meaning
                            of any actions in which it might be involved.</p>
                        <p>The President thanked the Prime Minister and gave a general summary of
                            his view of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. The U.S. was not interested
                            in starting wars, but in keeping peace. The U.S. had no desire to
                            threaten any government in the area, and wanted nothing more than the
                            restoration of peace in countries which were now under attack from
                            outside. The U.S. was not going to be pushed out, but the Prime Minister
                            could be absolutely sure that the President intended to follow a policy
                            of peace.</p>
                        <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his satisfaction in this general exposition
                            and said he fully understood the very difficult and important problems
                            which the U.S. faced in Southeast Asia. He agreed that the U.S. could
                            not simply pull out and that it must continue its support for
                            governments which were not always very good at supporting themselves,
                            difficult as this task might be. The Prime Minister said that, on the
                            other hand, he did think it would be dangerous to move in directions
                            which had recently been mentioned by Senator Goldwater,<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">Reference is to a May 24 statement calling for the
                                use of low-level nuclear devices to defoliate jungles and for the
                                bombing of bridges, roads, and railroads in North Vietnam used to
                                supply the insurgency in South Vietnam.</note> and that any drastic
                            escalation would give great problems both in Canada and internationally.
                            The Prime Minister said that it would be a different matter if action
                            could be carefully limited and directed in the interdiction of supply
                            lines from North to South.</p>
                        <p>The President firmly interjected that the Prime Minister could be
                            absolutely sure that the present Administration had no interest at all
                            in the kind of thing which Senator Goldwater had mentioned. The
                            President himself was a man of peace, and his Administration was going
                            to be an Administration of peace. If it did become necessary, against
                            the President's own hopes and desires, to act against the
                            North, the President's intention was that such action should
                            be carefully limited.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his satisfaction at the
                            President's comment and said that he thought it would be very
                            important to have targets carefully defined and sharply delimited. It
                            would be one thing to attack a bridge or an oil tank, but quite another
                            to shower bombs on a village full of women and children.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his clear agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister then talked briefly about more
                            general aspects of the problem. The President indicated the next

                            assignment. The conversation then became informal and social, and the
                            President introduced the Prime Minister to members of his family and
                            others guests in the Presidential suite.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister later informed me that at a moment when I was out of
                            the room, he had mentioned to the President the important meeting of
                            Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London in July,<note n="5" xml:id="d320fn5">July 8-15.</note> and had said that he would be
                            glad to know of any special U.S. views which it might be helpful for
                            Canada to know about at the time of such a meeting. He told me that the
                            President had expressed interest, and I undertook to make sure that we
                            would be in a position to offer such close consultation before the Prime
                            Minister's meeting.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In pressing upon the Prime Minister the fact that he was determined to
                            keep the peace, the President added to the other arguments in the basic
                            memorandum a reference to the election of 1964. He said that in this
                            year, above all others, it was his firm intention to be a
                            “peace man.” He had no intention of looking for
                            military adventures. If he adopted any other policy he ought to be
                            “bored for the simples.”</p>

                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> that I was glad
                            of this opportunity to meet him and to discuss with him informally the
                            subject of the Canadian claims and pending legislation in relation to
                            U.S. rights and interests. I said that I had no instructions, and that
                            the purpose of my visit was to acquaint myself at first hand with the
                            Canadian government's position and arguments. We agreed that
                            nothing that would be said or omitted by either of us in the course of
                            our conversation would be considered to constitute any change in the
                            position of either side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> reviewed the situation
                            at some length and in the course of our discussion, the following points
                            emerged:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Gulf of St. Lawrence </hi>: I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> what was the essential Canadian
                            concern with regard to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. I said that if it was a
                            matter of the restriction and control of fishing, we could consider
                            participating in a multilateral conference with various other countries
                            to see if agreement could be reached on fishing practices. On the other
                            hand, if it was a question of security, we were prepared to engage in
                            bilateral talks with the Canadian government to consider the factors
                            involved and see what we might be able to do to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> said that closing the
                            Gulf was essentially a domestic political necessity. While both fishing
                            and security were an important consideration, the present situation had
                            been inherited from the previous government, which was prepared to go to
                            the limit on the issue, and which would have the full backing of the
                            five maritime Provinces. The Prime Minister had no alternative to facing
                            up to the United States if we maintained our opposition to the point of
                            trying to take Canada before the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>,
                            except to let his government fall, as it most surely would if it did not
                            close the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">”Customary” versus
                                “historic” rights</hi>: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName>, while disputing this issue
                            along the familiar Canadian lines, said he thought this <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0721"/>would be no problem as part of an
                            overall agreement, including the area and species aspects.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">U.S. trawlers within 12-mile limit</hi>: I raised
                            this in the form of a question for my own information, and was told this
                            would present no difficulty.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Canadian consultation with other countries</hi>:
                            Canada has already held, and will pursue talks with the following
                            countries between now and the end of the year: France, U.K., Norway,
                            Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it has told Japan what it has in
                            mind. It does not plan to talk with any additional countries. One reason
                            why the Canadian government is opposed to convening a multilateral
                            conference on the question of the waters of the Gulf is that the
                            Japanese would insist on participating for their fishing interests,
                            while the Russians would press to come in for their own sinister
                            purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> said that
                            the French and the Norwegians had already indicated that they would have
                            no trouble with the Canadian move.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Legislative timetable</hi>: The Canadian Government
                            expects Bill S-17 to become law by July 15. It will have some
                            flexibility with regard to applying the law, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> used such phrases as
                            “certainly not before the end of the year, and well into the
                            spring of 1965,” and “maybe one year if the
                            Government can say that negotiations are still under way.” At
                            another point, he used the words “well into next
                            year.”</p>
                        <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Canadian position</hi>: The Government position is
                            that it has no alternative to proclaiming the extension of the fisheries
                            zone to 12 miles, on a straight baseline basis, including closing lines
                            for the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Without abandoning formally its claims to
                            closing the Arctic Archipelago and Queen Charlotte Sound, the Canadian
                            Government is prepared to postpone such action indefinitely. I asked
                            whether Queen Charlotte Sound would encompass the adjoining waters of
                            Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> said it would not, but that the Canadian
                            Government would be prepared, if we could reach agreement, to refer the
                            issue concerning these two bodies of water to arbitration. I asked about
                            the Bay of Fundy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> said
                            that it was not of comparable importance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
                            that he did not think “that it would be a very difficult
                            matter for Canada and the U.S.” I inferred from the foregoing
                            that the Canadians have in mind the following package: the U.S. (1) to
                            confine itself to protests and to give up going to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>, (2) to accept the closing of
                            Hudson's Bay and Hudson's Strait, in return for
                            which the Canadians would: (1) proclaim the extension of the fisheries
                            zone on a straight baseline basis to 12 miles, (2) proclaim the closing
                            of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, (3) defer action on the Arctic Archipelago,
                            (4) defer action on Queen Charlotte Sound, (5) submit Hecate Strait and
                            Dixon Entrance to arbitration, (6) defer action on closing the Bay of
                            Fundy in order to try to work out <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0722"/>something mutually acceptable, (7) agree to, and be
                            prepared to grant the most formal assurances to protect the exercise of
                            our customary fishing rights, (8) not raise any difficulties about U.S.
                                trawlers.<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">At the time it effected its
                                12-mile fishing ban, the Government of Canada issued an
                                “Order in Council” that exempted the United
                                States and certain other nations from its provisions. The text was

                            will not appear before the Court in any circumstances. It would invoke

                            by pointing out that the U.S. record of acceptance of the authority of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> was greatly inferior to that of

                            </hi>: At the conclusion of our talk, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> advanced again the argument that we were
                            proposing to treat Canada more harshly than we had treated other
                            countries, e.g.: Indonesia, which had established a 12-mile limit and
                            had enclosed certain bodies of water. I pointed out the particular
                            circumstances of the proximity to the U.S. of the waters which Canada
                            was proposing to enclose, and of the degree to which these waters were
                            of importance to our security. We were not motivated by the desire to
                            deal harshly with Canada, but we considered their proposed restrictions
                            obnoxious, not only in themselves, but because they created a precedent
                            for other countries to invoke. We thus could not afford to be less
                            severe toward Canada on this issue than we would have to be toward
                            others. Finally, I said it looked as though we were both in for a rough
                            time, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName> agreed.</p>

                            with him at Windsor, which is his home town.</p>
                        <p>We opened up with South Vietnam. I told him about the events of the last
                            two days out there. He in turn told me that Seaborn (who did not wish to
                            be identified to Americans as the source) felt gloomy about the prospect
                            and in discussing details it was apparent that Seaborn was concentrating
                            on the political disarray in Saigon itself at the top levels of
                            government and had not really been focusing on what was happening in the
                            provinces or the military action against the Viet Cong. We did not agree
                            on a further date for a possible Seaborn visit to Hanoi. I told Paul
                            Martin that I would see to it that Seaborn's negative
                            interpretation would not be passed to American sources in a way that
                            would embarrass his relations with Americans in Saigon. Mr. Martin spoke
                            especially highly of the intimate relations between Seaborn and
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>. Mr. Martin
                            told me that he had pressed Ikeda while on his recent trip to Japan<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">September 4-5.</note> to take a more active
                            part in Asian affairs. Specifically, Martin said that Canada would drop
                            out of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and urged Ikeda that
                            Japan should take on that responsibility. Apparently, Ikeda did not
                            volunteer. Martin commented that it was alleged that there were some
                            constitutional objections to Japan's undertaking such a role
                            but that he, Martin, was convinced that this would not apply to such
                            activities as the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or to the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>On Cyprus, Martin had little new to offer except that Diefenbaker was
                            making life very difficult for the government. Martin indicated that
                            Canada was prepared to have its troops remain for another period of
                            service and asked me whether I thought that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could raise the necessary funds to take care of the
                            needs of the other contingents. (He stated that Canada would bear the
                            cost of the Canadian component.) I told him that I thought that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be able to raise such
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>Martin then told me about the proposed meeting in Ottawa of the countries
                            (other than the great powers) which had contributed forces to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping activities. He said the
                            Russians had strongly opposed this meeting and had been working against
                            it in other capitals on the ground that it was a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> imperialist plot. Martin said he had
                            told the Russian Ambassador that this was a complete mistake and that
                            the meeting would simply exchange views among those who had indicated
                            their readiness to make troops available for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that the representation would be across a broad
                            political spectrum. Martin said he still agreed that the great powers
                            ought not to be excluded in theory from contributing such forces to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but he and I both agreed that it
                            was undoubtedly better for the great powers not to be included in this
                            particular meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0724"/>
                        <p>We discussed Article 19 and I emphasized the importance in not taking the
                            United States for granted on this issue and suggested if there is to be
                            any change in the Soviet position, it would probably require complete
                            solidarity among the rest of the membership—as in the case of
                            the Troika proposal. Martin seemed to have some vague notion that the
                            Soviets might find some way to compromise but he offered no evidence of
                            a Soviet intention to do so.</p>
                        <p>We talked briefly about the automotive parts problem and I emphasized
                            that our lawyers were almost certain to reach a decision against Canada
                            under our legislation and that it was of the utmost importance to talk
                            the matter over promptly at a ministerial level to see whether some
                            answer could not be found. He did not make a flat commitment on such
                            talks but it was clear that he was concerned about the chain reaction
                            which might get started if we invoked our own legislative remedies. He
                            made the point that both sides were prospering in our mutual trade and
                            that we should not let something like this interfere with it. I told him
                            that it was very hard to convince people, whose interests were adversely
                            affected by practices for which we had a legal remedy, to take their
                            comfort from the general prosperity of Canadian-American trade. (<hi rend="italic">This should be followed up to press for the

                        <p>I pressed Mr. Martin on trade with Cuba but he retreated behind the wheat
                            deal with the Soviet Union and referred to certain steps of cooperation,
                            such as reducing airplane flights, and I got no impression that he was
                            considering additional specific steps. I told him that I thought that a
                            recent resolution of hemisphere Foreign Ministers had the indirect
                            effect of deferring indefinitely Canadian membership in the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> because it would be unlikely that the

                            concluded by saying that he thought it probable that the matter was now

                        <p>I told him about our attitude on Malaysia and emphasized that our problem
                            was not the policy problem as to whether at some stage the United States
                            might not become involved but rather the practical problem that we could
                            not become involved unless those who had direct commitments evidenced a
                            substantial commitment of their own to provide the forces to deal with
                            Indonesian aggression against Malaysia. I told him that the time was
                            finished when the United States could act as the residual of
                            responsibility in such matters if others approached it on the basis of
                            meeting responsibility. He indicated that Canada had sent a survey team
                            to Malaysia to inquire into what assistance Canada might give but
                            clearly indicated that this would not take the form of military forces.
                            They may assist Malaysia with aircraft and other equipment if the
                            Malaysian mission now in Washington indicates an interest in such help
                            on its projected visit to Canada.</p>

                            expressed our appreciation for Canada's important

                        </list>
                        <p>I have read Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>'s memorandum of September 15<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> recommending that the
                            decision whether to impose countervailing duties on imports of
                            automotive products from Canada be reached on legal, <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0726"/>rather than on economic or political
                            considerations. I agree with this conclusion. I believe, however, that
                            we should be fully aware of the economic and political considerations
                            and that in view of the potential effects of the decision made, the
                            legal aspects of the matter should be as clear as possible.</p>
                        <p>Canada is our largest trading partner. In 1963, our trade with Canada
                            exceeded $8 billion, or 20% of our total foreign trade. Our exports to
                            Canada exceeded our imports by over $400 million. In the automotive
                            sector alone our exports during 1963 totalled $550 million whereas our
                            imports amounted to $22 million. In 1964 the figures are expected to
                            reach $700 million and $60 million respectively.</p>
                        <p>If the decision is reached to impose countervailing duties on automotive
                            imports from Canada, it will mean the failure of the Canadian automotive
                            plan. The duty would be at the flat rate of 21-1/4% (in addition to the
                            normal duty of 8-1/2%) based on Treasury's estimate of the
                            benefits accruing to Canadian manufacturers from the duty remission
                            plan. Since the <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>
                            Government is deeply committed to the objectives of this plan, it is
                            expected that the Canadian Government will adopt an alternative plan,
                            probably involving an increase in “Canadian
                            content” (the percentage of production which must be
                            performed in Canada). The major United States automobile manufacturers
                            have told us that such a decision by Canada would require them to make
                            additional investments in Canada of several hundred million dollars, in
                            order to protect the $600 million investment they already have there.
                            For this reason, Ford, GM and Chrysler have stated that they would be
                            placed in serious difficulty by the imposition of countervailing
                            duties.</p>
                        <p>Politically, we must expect that the imposition of countervailing duties
                            would put a severe strain on our relations with Canada. The position of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> Government will be
                            damaged and as a matter of political preservation it would be likely to
                            issue furious anti-American statements to protect itself against
                            anticipated taunts from the Diefenbaker forces. I therefore do not agree
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that the
                            imposition of countervailing duties will improve our negotiating
                            position with Canada. Moreover, the dispute could affect Canadian
                            cooperation with us in other fields.</p>
                        <p>The legal aspects of this matter are technical and properly within the
                            responsibility of the Treasury Department. I note, however, in Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>'s
                            memorandum that a respectable case has been made that the Canadian plan
                            involves no subsidy and that the issue is likely to be tested in the
                            courts at any event. I wonder, in the circumstances, whether it would
                            not be prudent to ask the Department of Justice to render an opinion on
                            the question. This would, of course, involve a delay beyond the November
                            1 date proposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, but it <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0727"/>is my understanding that the significance of this date is primarily
                            one of administrative convenience rather than of legal necessity.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to my talk with <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul
                                Martin</persName> last Monday,<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">See <ref target="#d322">Document 322</ref>.</note> the Canadian Embassy
                            has now informed us that the Canadians have developed some new proposals
                            for an alternative to the Canadian remission plan based on a freer flow
                            of trade. While the Embassy was not at liberty to discuss the new
                            Canadian proposals, they indicated that they followed the lines of
                            suggestions by United States representatives last summer. We propose to
                            meet with the Canadians in Ottawa on September 24 and 25. These talks
                            should indicate whether there exists a basis for an acceptable agreement
                            with Canada which would result in termination of the remission plan and
                            avoid the necessity to impose countervailing duties. In the
                            circumstances I strongly recommend that the decision regarding
                            countervailing duties be deferred until the results of the next talks
                            are known.<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">In a September 22 memorandum to
                                President Johnson, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that he had the authority to issue a
                                countervailing decision without reference to the Department of
                                Justice and that November was the latest date such an order could be
                                issued without impact on U.S. production. He suggested that issuance
                                of the order be delayed to on or about November 10 to allow further

                                Wilbur Mills</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>As you may remember, the Canadian auto parts row has been one of the most
                            troublesome issues between us and Pearson's Government for
                            about a year. The Canadians put on a tariff scheme, designed to <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0728"/>stimulate production in Canada,
                            which sharply penalized independent American auto suppliers. In response
                            to their spurs, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Doug Dillon</persName> has
                            been urging us to apply a countervailing duty against Canada; this is
                            what the letter of the law seems to him to require, but the trouble is
                            that it would start a major trade fracas with the Canadians and do no
                            one any good.</p>
                        <p>Common sense has now prevailed, and a possible bargain is shaping up
                            which has the support of all departments of your Government, most of the
                            auto industry, and—we are confident—the Canadians.
                            It is as follows:</p>
                        <p>—Both Canada and the United States would eliminate tariffs on
                            automobiles and most automobile parts originating in the other
                            country.</p>
                        <p>—The Canadian Government would make a side deal with the major
                            automobile producers who operate on both sides of the border; the
                            producers would commit themselves to increase somewhat the fraction of
                            their output originating in Canada. The shift is to take place over four
                            years and would be made easy by the rising market for automobiles both
                            here and there; it should cause us very little trouble. (Justice has
                            some anti-trust worries about this, but nothing very serious.)</p>
                        <p>The big companies are all in line (Ford and Chrysler with gusto). The
                            only negative reaction has come from some independent parts producers.
                            One company, Modine, with parts—plants employing a total of
                            about 1,250 workers in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and California, is
                            openly hostile. The bulk of the parts industry, however, is either in
                            favor or neutral.</p>
                        <p>The UAW would be prepared to support the proposal if they can be assured
                            that there will be adequate provision for dislocated workers. Labor
                            believes we can work this out with Reuther and his people.</p>
                        <p>The immediate problem is to get Wilbur Mills to agree to push the
                            necessary implementing legislation. You do not now have authority to
                            reduce U.S. tariffs to zero on goods from a particular country. The plan
                            is to tack an appropriate amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>
                        <p>From a preliminary check by the Ford people, it appears that Mills would
                            be receptive to pushing this through quickly, right after Medicare. If
                            you instruct us to proceed, Dillon will talk with Mills and try to get a
                            clear commitment on this point. This particular matter should take only
                            3-4 days of hearings. So it will delay other items very little. Henry
                            Wilson in O'Brien's office concurs in this
                            tactic.</p>
                        <p>The matter is fairly urgent. Doug claims that if the Canadians do not
                            rescind their current tariff scheme he must impose countervailing
                            tariffs by January 1 or face jail. The Canadians would be prepared to
                            rescind in return for an agreement which would commit us to go to the
                            Congress for the necessary legislation during the winter. If you <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0729"/>agree, and if Mills is
                            agreeable, we can probably close the deal with Pearson's
                            people well before January 1. This will be a major achievement, and one
                            with some news value too.</p>

                        <p>We have consistently stressed that Canadian proposals create vital
                            security problem for us and Free World generally; we are convinced that
                            less friendly nations (e.g. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            Indonesia, etc.) could use Canadian precedent to close off vast areas

                            allies. While we thus cannot accept Canadian proposals we have tried
                            through many months of discussion to take forthcoming attitude, seeking
                            arrangements that would accommodate Canadian needs without creating

                        <p>On April 2, 1965, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, in an address at Temple University in
                            Philadelphia, suggested changes in U.S. policy in the Vietnam conflict.
                            President Johnson invited Pearson to meet with him the following day at
                            Camp David, Maryland. According to the President's Daily
                            Diary, the meeting was held between 12:30 and 2:45 p.m. (Johnson
                            Library) No U.S. record of the discussions between the two men was
                            found. At an April 22 press conference in Ottawa, <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> confirmed reports that the
                            meeting with the President centered on the question of Vietnam and had
                            been acrimonious but insisted that they had parted on good terms.

                                U.S. policy of restraint and reaffirmed his statements to Parliament
                                of July 26 of support for the “purposes and
                                objectives” of U.S. policy in Vietnam, reaffirming
                                Canada's willingness to provide economic assistance to
                                South Vietnam. He concluded by stressing the need to bring the
                                United Nations more fully into the search for a peaceful solution to
                                the war. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Special Heads of
                                State Correspondence, Canada-Pearson, Vol. 1)</note> He said that
                            the members of the Cabinet are scattered now but he would discuss the
                            problem as soon as the Cabinet could be called together. He added that
                            this might have to be sooner than later if the postal strike did not
                            take a turn for the better for in that case he would be left no option
                            but to recall Parliament and legislate the postal workers back to their
                            jobs. A move which he certainly did not wish to take.</p>
                        <p>I have the feeling, based on several conversations, that <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> has now had a change of mind
                            and has come to the view he would prefer an election this fall for a
                            number of reasons including the fact that he would not like to fight
                            through Parliament his medical insurance plan without a majority behind
                            him. But knowing him as I do, I <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0733"/>am sure that the final decision will be made not far in advance. Be
                            this as it may, the increase in our military commitment in Vietnam and
                            any further notable increases in Canada's civil benefactions
                            will be regarded by his party as politically disadvantageous
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally the Embassy's information is that the additional
                            $500,000 of aid to Vietnam which the Canadian Govt publicly announced at

                        <p>Mr. Martin asked if the Secretary had been briefed on the auto parts
                            agreement now before the Congress. He pointed out that this issue was
                            significant in the coming Canadian elections and that his party was
                            concerned about it. It has gone through the House without problems but
                            in the Senate it has been amended to provide for a Congressional review
                            in 1968. While Martin said that he has been told that this problem will
                            be ironed out in the Senate-House Conference, it would be a great
                            disappointment if it were not. The Canadians feel that the agreement as
                            negotiated provides adequately for automatic review, since the President
                            would have to report on its implementation to the Congress after 1968.
                            In any case it would be impossible to judge how the agreement is working
                            by the beginning of 1968 and thus Congressional review could serve no
                            useful purpose.</p>
                        <p>Martin pointed out that, if the Senate provision for review stands, there
                            will be considerable political uproar in Canada. It would be claimed
                            that the United States had repudiated the agreement and the Liberal
                            Party would have to pay a price for this politically.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin said that he hoped that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and the administration would throw their weight
                            behind the agreement as reported out by the House. He has already been
                            maintaining in his political statements that this is an agreement which
                            serves both American and Canadian interests, and that, had relations
                            between Canada and the US not been very good, it could not have been
                            negotiated. Martin said the Liberals have been trying to avoid
                            anti-American attacks by the Conservatives in the campaign and this
                            would be most difficult to achieve if the Senate amendment was
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he would
                            look into the matter and get a report by the following day. The
                            Administration also hopes that the agreement will not be altered by
                            Congress, he said. But he cautioned that under the United States
                            constitutional system if Congress turned down an administration
                            proposal, there is no recourse.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the meeting the Secretary asked Martin what line should
                            be taken with the Press. If Martin desired, the Secretary said, he could
                            report that he had made the strongest representations on the auto parts
                                agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">The Automotive Products Trade

                            “if there is anything constructive that we can do in relation
                            to Canada at the present time.” While there are several which
                            I will list below, I believe there is no one thing which would be more
                            constructive or work more good for US-Canadian understanding at this
                            time than a visit here by the President. I will recommend certain
                            specifics about this in Part II of this telegram.</p>
                        <p>I. The political and psychological climate in Canada suggests that a
                            visit by the President could have a tremendous impact in focussing the
                            attention of Canadians upon enduring common interests between our
                            countries and in redirecting their fixation away from such problem
                            issues between us as Vietnam and China which they persistently view so
                            astigmatically. Canadians need and would welcome new definitions and new
                            challenges. Never in their hundred years of federation has there been
                            less accommodation between French Canadian and English Canadian citizens
                            or a less tenable division of power between the central government and
                            the provinces. The political system is without reliable bearings or
                            direction and is scarred by internal bickering and vituperation that has
                            resulted in no major party's meriting enough popular
                            confidence to hold an electoral majority. In these circumstances, it is
                            truly remarkable that as Canada's only neighbor and potential
                            scapegoat we are the recipients of less captious criticism or hostility
                            than we might expect. Alongside the U.S. and its strong central guidance
                            and purpose, Canadians feel an inferiority that is displayed in envy,
                            resentment, and, particularly in foreign affairs, in sanctimoniousness.
                            We have to recognize that against this backdrop of internal tensions and
                            immaturity there are limits to what we can do. On such problem issues
                            between us as Vietnam and China on which feeling is general and not
                            merely regional, only peace in Vietnam or the success of a two-China
                            policy (or its failure with Canada's getting badly burned in
                            the process) would exorcise these diversionary subjects.</p>
                        <p>On most foreign issues, however, we are not far apart, and strictly
                            bilateral problems usually yield to satisfactory settlement. Since the
                                <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0736"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> government came to power in 1963, we have
                            accomplished a number of things as described in my 1964 and 1965 annual
                            reviews (A-581 and A-638)<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">Neither printed.
                                (Both ibid.)</note> such as: Canada's acceptance of
                            nuclear weapons, the Columbia River Treaty, the auto parts agreement,
                            the civil air accord, elimination of lead and zinc quotas, a balance of
                            payments agreement, etc. We have staved off but not yet dissuaded Canada
                            from pursuing its Law of the Sea statute which provides for enclosure of
                            waters, now part of the high seas, by new baselines. Since for good
                            reason our opposition is implacable, we should seek to avoid a future
                            public confrontation by making our position unmistakably clear.</p>
                        <p>II. Of the constructive things that we can do, I want to single out one
                            from the following list as uniquely appropriate should the President be
                            able to visit Ottawa. This is the St. John River project now nearing the
                            end of negotiations. The President could expect to address a joint
                            session of the two Houses of Parliament, and the announcement of a St.
                            John River agreement on that occasion would accent our continental
                            partnership and dramatize for Canadians our common interest and
                            advantage in close cooperation. A Presidential visit customarily takes
                            place when Parliament is in session so that he can address a joint
                            session of both Houses. Parliament is expected to remain in session
                            until about mid-July, and a visit in early July would be feasible.
                            Parliament is not expected to resume its session until sometime in
                            September, and in addition the President will no doubt wish to consider
                            a brief trip to Montreal to visit the American Pavilion at the
                            Exposition in the late spring or early summer of 1967. Therefore, the
                            spacing of these visits is a consideration.</p>
                        <p>Other constructive things, no one of which by itself is calculated to
                            change very much the tenor of U.S.-Canadian relations, but together are
                            of cumulative importance, are as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) Official designation of the NORAD regional headquarters at North Bay,
                            Ontario, as alternate command post to CINCNORAD's main
                            headquarters at Colorado Springs. Canadians would regard this
                            designation as a matter of gratifying prestige and closer military
                            partnership.</p>
                        <p>(2) Clarification by the U.S. Department of Defense of the desideratum
                            for Canada's future military role and contribution to <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> and Western defense. Canada is
                            preparing itself increasingly and all but irrevocably for a small power
                            capability and for restrictively peacekeeping
                            operations—without nuclear weapons (see pp. 17 et seq. of
                            A-638).</p>
                        <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0737"/>
                        <p>(3) Further reduction of trade barriers on both a multilateral and
                            bilateral basis. Currently the US is rightly emphasizing negotiations in
                            the Kennedy Round in connection with the efforts of both Canada and the
                            US to achieve a liberalization of trade in multilateral context.
                            Following the Kennedy Round we should examine with Canada prospects for
                            further liberalization bilaterally such as was achieved by the
                            US-Canadian automotive agreement.</p>
                        <p>(4) An explicit decision to exempt Canada from present and future U.S.
                            balance-of-payments corrective measures, in return for a continuing
                            Canadian commitment to hold down and even to reduce Canadian gold and
                            foreign exchange reserves. The existing agreement with Canada, whereby
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has agreed to reduce reserves in
                            1966 by $300 million to the advantage of the U.S., assures the U.S. that
                            any Canadian <gloss target="#t_BP1">B/P</gloss> gains this year will in
                            fact accrue to our benefit. U.S. direct investment capital outflow to
                            Canada is nevertheless limited by the U.S. guidelines. Any restrictions
                            applied against travel to Canada would gravely disturb our relationship
                            particularly in view upcoming Expo 67 whereas situation in fact offers
                            opportunity for cooperative action by US and Canada to promote tourism
                            to North America given reserves agreement.</p>
                        <p>(5) Elimination or amelioration of extra-territorial effects of U.S.
                            legislation on U.S. subsidiaries in Canada, e.g. such as section 5 (b)
                            of the Trading With the Enemy Act.</p>
                        <p>(6) Definitive liberalization or elimination of the cheddar cheese quota,
                            particularly on aged cheddar.</p>
                        <p>(7) It would be useful now to clarify authoritatively for the Canadian
                            Government the amendments to our 1965 Immigration Act insofar as they
                            apply to Canada. This act [garble] long-term meaning, for example,
                            especially in relation to the mobility of managerial, professional, and
                            technical personnel in North America. Also, it is highly desirable that
                            there be an authoritative clarification of our Selective Service Act in
                            its application to legal alien residents in the US, persons with dual
                            US-Canadian citizenship, and other persons resident in Canada who may be
                            subject to it. Problems arising from ambiguities in this field are
                            increasing and are getting into the political arena here.</p>
                        <p>(8) Establishment of an international park on Point Roberts, a small US
                            appendage to British Columbia accessible to Americans only via
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>(9) Opening of a <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> office with a
                            library in the Consulate General in Montreal manned by a young
                            French-speaking officer for the counter—Gaullist and other
                            reasons I have enumerated ad nauseum.</p>

                        <p>At Ambassador Johnson's invitation, Ambassador Ritchie called
                            on him the afternoon of June 1 to receive the US response to the
                            suggestion that Foreign Minister Martin had made to Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> in February<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2"> Martin made the suggestion February 18 during his
                                visit to Washington. No U.S. record of the conversation was found.
                                Ritchie supplied a copy of the Canadian record of conversation to
                                Johnson on June 3. (Ibid., POL 33-4 CAN-US)</note> that a way be
                            found so that Canada could declare certain large bodies of
                            water—e.g., the Gulf of the St. Lawrence—to be
                            Canadian fishing seas. Ambassador Johnson gave Ambassador Ritchie an
                            Aide-Mémoire, a copy of which is attached to this
                                memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">Not printed.</note> and said
                            that while the US, after very careful consideration, could find no
                            support in international law for the conversion of high seas into
                            fishing seas, it was the intention of the US to be as helpful as
                            possible in aiding Canada to achieve a solution to the problems its
                            fishermen face or fear they will someday face.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Ritchie expressed great disappointment that Mr.
                            Martin's proposal had not received US assent and noted that
                            not only did the proposal represent a retreat from the original Canadian
                            intention of declaring the bodies of water in question to be internal
                            Canadian waters but that, further, the proposal had been suggested by
                            the US in the first place. Ambassador Ritchie said that
                            Canada's retreat from its initial position had resulted from
                            Canada's recognition of the security problem any diminution
                            of the high seas would present to the US and expressed doubt that any
                            international conservation scheme would meet Canada's
                            needs.</p>
                        <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0739"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Ritchie added that it was Canada's wish to deny the
                            areas in question to foreign fishermen, except for those with treaty
                            rights, and had expected from the conversation in February that the US
                            would help them do that. Ambassador Ritchie ended his remarks by saying
                            that the US response seemed completely to ignore Mr. Martin's
                            talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> and that he
                            was certain Mr. Martin would be disappointed at the US decision because
                            he had been “counting on it”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Johnson said that it was most regrettable if the Canadian
                            Government had been misled and volunteered to review the record. He
                            added, however, that his willingness to review the record ought not to
                            be interpreted as detracting in any way from the
                            Aide-Mémoire.</p>

                        <p>During March and June 1966 the Government of Canada sent Chester Ronning,
                            a retired diplomat and Sinologist, to Hanoi to conduct soundings
                            regarding the willingness of the Government of North Vietnam to enter
                            into negotiations with the United States to terminate hostilities in
                            South Vietnam. At the conclusion of his second trip June 14-17, Ronning
                            flew to Washington accompanied by Foreign Minister Martin, for a meeting
                            with U.S. officials at which he outlined North Vietnamese positions. A

                        <p>Mr. Martin took the initiative to raise the subject of the Law of the
                            Sea. He recalled that he had first discussed the matter with Ambassador
                            Johnson two and one-half years ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">See <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> Since then Canada had
                            established a 12-mile fishing zone, and the Canadian Parliament had
                            passed legislation authorizing the drawing of baselines in a manner
                            which would incorporate certain bodies of water as Canadian territorial
                            waters. The matter had now reached a stage where the Canadian Government
                            would have to move further. He recalled that then-Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> had made a personal
                            suggestion that the US could accept the Canadian action if it involved
                            only fishing, but Canada had not accepted the suggestion.<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3">Apparent reference to the June 7, 1964, meeting of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Cadieux</persName>; see <ref target="#d321">Document 321</ref>.</note> Later, Mr. Martin had discussed the
                            matter with then-Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d334fn4">See <ref target="#d332fn2">footnote 2, Document 332</ref>.</note> He had
                            told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTC1">Mann</persName> that while Canada
                            would be unhappy that no further progress had been made, the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> was now proposing to move only with
                            regard <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0741"/>to fishing and not to
                            the extent of claiming ownership of the waters, although on this latter
                            point Canada would explicitly reserve its position.</p>
                        <p>(During this discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> intervened to stress that the <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> proposal had not been official,
                            and the Secretary remarked with a smile that this had been what the
                            lawyers call “a frolic of his own”.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin went on to say that he hoped the US would now reconsider the
                            fishing proposal. If the US cannot do so, Canada will have to go back to
                            its original position, i.e. to claim the waters as exclusively Canadian
                            for all purposes. This, he said, is what the Canadian legislation calls
                            for, and he just could not face Parliament when it reconvenes this fall
                            without being able to report progress. (“We have reached
                            dead-end. There is no other course.”) Under such
                            circumstances his plea to the US would be that we limit our action to a
                            protest.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded initially by pointing out that our major concern
                            is the question of general applicability. If Canada can do what it
                            proposes, others can close off the Java Sea and other bodies of water,
                            the free access to which is of vital importance to us. The Secretary
                            also commented that to refer, as Mr. Martin had done, to bodies of water
                            such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence as “internal
                            waters” was begging the question. Surely this very question
                            was what was at issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin responded that in his view the Canadian action would not
                            prejudice the US case elsewhere in the world. Surely there were unique
                            circumstances involved in the Canadian case which any court would
                            recognize are not paralleled elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>There followed a general discussion of possible action by the
                            International Court of Justice. Mr. Martin doubted that Canada would
                            agree that the US could take Canada to court on the matter, although he
                            said he recognized clearly that the US could instigate court action by
                            another party. If Canada were faced with a suit before the Court, he
                            would simply turn the proposal over to the Canadian Department of
                            Justice to be dealt with by the best lawyers they could find, and he
                            thought the US would be wrong to assume that the Canadian case could not
                            prevail.</p>
                        <p>Commenting that he saw real trouble ahead on this issue, the Secretary
                            pressed Mr. Martin for a clear statement of what the real Canadian
                            interest was. Was it fishing? The flag? Security? Mr. Martin responded
                            emphatically that the interest was fishing.</p>
                        <p>At another point in the conversation, Mr. Martin recalled that the matter
                            had also been discussed between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> and President Kennedy at their
                            Hyannis Port meeting, but Ambassador Johnson pointed out that this was
                            the one issue discussed at Hyannis Port on which President Kennedy had
                            made clear, as indeed was indicated <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0742"/>in the communiqué,<note n="5" xml:id="d334fn5">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of
                                    the Presidents of the United States: John F. Kennedy, 1963</hi>,
                                pp. 371-374.</note> that the US did not accept the Canadian
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin added that fishing is not a legal matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Johnson at one point recalled that the US had offered to
                            accept one portion of the Canadian fishing proposal, that which had to
                            do with Hudson Bay. Mr. Martin responded that, of course, this was the
                            least important part of the proposal and therefore the offer was not
                            acceptable to Canada.</p>
                        <p>At one point in the discussion, Mr. Martin pointed out that the Canadian
                            fishing proposal concerned only the East Coast, and he argued that in
                            preparing its proposal Canada had taken great care not to harm US
                            fishing interests in any way whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated his concern about the general applicability of a
                            Canadian move to close off the waters in question. We cannot acquiesce
                            in one area and still insist that it cannot be done elsewhere in the
                            world. The Secretary at one point suggested that perhaps we ought to
                            appoint people on either side to take a hard look at the matter, but
                            nothing specific was agreed upon and this part of the conversation ended
                                inconclusively.<note n="6" xml:id="d334fn6">On August 15 Ambassador
                                Ritchie presented Johnson with a letter from Martin to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> restating the decision to

                            the Prime Minister at Rossmount Inn in the little town of Chamcook, N.B.
                            The lunch was preceded by approximately an hour and a half of serious
                            conversation in a parlor of the Inn set aside for the purpose.)</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said there was one bilateral problem which he wanted
                            to raise. He briefly reviewed the history of discussions between Canada
                            and the US on the Law of the Sea, and he referred to the proposal
                            recently set forth by his Foreign Minister in a letter to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> regarding
                            Canada's proposal to establish fishing rights over the Bay of
                            Fundy, the Gulf of the St. Lawrence, and parts of the west coast.<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">See <ref target="#d334fn6">footnote 6,
                                    Document 334</ref>.</note> He noted there had been some
                            discussion of the legal problems involved, but he supposed these were
                            not things that could be settled by the World Court because of the US
                            problem with the Connally Amendment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWW1">Butterworth</persName> interjected
                            that in view of this aspect of the legal question, the US had a long
                            time ago proposed that the two governments join in a friendly suit
                            before the International Court of Justice to seek a determination prior
                            to any action by Canada. He <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0744"/>pointed out that Canada had turned down the proposal. The Prime
                            Minister appeared not to have heard of this aspect of the matter and
                            remarked, “That's something we shall have to look
                            into.” It was noted, in closing, that the Canadians had not
                            yet received a reply to the Foreign Minister's letter to the
                            Secretary.</p>

                            handed Canadian Ambassador by Deputy Under Secy Johnson at 5:30 pm
                            today:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Secretary: I regret my absence from Washington
                            delayed for a time a reply to your letter of August 10 on the Law of the
                                Sea.<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">See <ref target="#d334fn6">footnote

                            matter was raised by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> with President Johnson during their August 21
                            Campobello meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d336fn3">See <ref target="#d335">Document 335</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I agree completely with you that this is a matter of great importance. We
                            have again thoroughly reviewed your proposal in the light of
                            international law, the general interests of the Free World as we see
                            them, and our own fishing interests. We have concluded that we cannot
                            accept, even tacitly, the establishment of the waters in question as
                            Canadian fishing seas.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I want to state again our willingness to give vigorous support
                            to a Canadian effort to establish a fisheries conservation regime in the
                            waters of concern to you.</p>
                        <p>During his meeting with the President, the Prime Minister indicated he
                            wanted to look into our suggestion of a friendly suit between the two
                            countries, prior to any action by your Government, before the
                            International Court of Justice. Should a less public proceeding seem <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0745"/>desirable to Canada, we would
                            also be willing to engage in a suitable arbitration.</p>
                        <p>I would very much regret it if your Government were unable to see its way
                            clear to pursuing any of the alternatives we have suggested and were to
                            proceed with the action your letter contemplates. I do not know
                            precisely how we would be obliged to respond to the assertion of your
                            claim that certain portions of the high seas have become internal
                            Canadian waters. It seems clear, however, that we would be forced to
                            protest it directly and publicly, to avail ourselves of the legal
                            remedies open to us, and to instruct our vessels and aircraft to
                            disregard it. If such a situation were to develop, we should, of course,
                            be faced with detailed inquiries from the Congress and from our press to
                            which we would be obliged to respond. Among the aspects of the matter
                            which it seems to me inevitably would thus become a matter of public
                            record would be that we had made clear our strong opposition prior to
                            the introduction of your legislation in Parliament and that we had
                            suggested means by which in our judgment the problem could be resolved
                            equitably.</p>
                        <p>This subject, like others that have troubled us in the past, will
                            eventually be, no matter what the outcome, a part of history. In the
                            meantime, I trust that the officials of both countries will do all
                            possible to ensure that it does not adversely affect any of the other
                            myriad subjects that concern our two countries.</p>

                        <p>1. In hour-long friendly but essentially unproductive conversation with
                            Secretary, Canadian FonMin Martin made lengthy plea to let Chicoms in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, stating that “if we miss this session, we
                            create tragic situation for world. Right course politically is to get it
                            over with now.” Martin repeatedly indicated he seriously
                            considering parting company with US this issue during current <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session, but he also reaffirmed that
                            Canada would not act without prior consultation. Martin stated he would
                            like have another chat before ChiRep issue voted in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary refuted Martin point by point, arguing that Chicoms
                            constitute major obstacle to ending Viet-Nam war; that to reward Chicoms
                            for misbehavior would prolong this war; that to have Chicoms in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would destroy its effectiveness for
                            peacekeeping. Secretary also suggested that Martin give more weight to
                            views of Asian nations on firing line in Far East; invited him to
                            consider question from purely Canadian national interest, and asked if
                            Martin's alleged problems vis-á-vishis own public
                            could not be solved by enlightening Canadian opinion on Chicom adamancy.
                            Secretary appeared make no dent on Martin except for grudging admission
                            that ChiRep issue is indeed “important” (from
                            context, however, it was not even clear if Martin views ChiRep as
                            “important question” in technical sense in context
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> rules).</p>
                        <p>3. Discussion of Law of the Sea likewise tended underscore basic
                            US-Canadian differences, though it did not completely slam door on
                            further negotiation. Martin took line that it would be politically
                            impossible for Canadian Govt to retreat from public position taken by
                            Canadian parliament. Martin argued that contemplated Canadian action
                            would not hurt US fisheries or security; would for present not be
                            extended West Coast; would not—as Secretary
                            suggested—set legal precedent for claims by other, notably,
                                <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> nations.</p>
                        <p>4. Martin appeared reject all suggestions made by Secretary and Legal
                            Adviser Meeker for litigation before <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>
                            or arbitration and even claimed to see little practical value in further
                            bilateral discussion. Martin did suggest the possibility of amending the
                            law so that it would apply only to fishing, “for parliament
                            only knows about fishing.” But when Secretary suggested he go
                            back and amend the act in this sense, Martin indicated he would only
                            consider doing this in return for US acceptance of Canadian position. In
                            final aside with Meeker, Martin evinced willingness to continue
                            bilateral discussion of the issue.<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2">On
                                October 17 U.S. and Canadian officials met for further discussions
                                of Canada's plan to extend its exclusive fishing rights.
                                After intensive discussions, the two sides failed to make progress
                                on their disagreements. A memorandum of conversation is ibid.,

                        <p>5. On removal of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> from Paris, Martin
                            seemed somewhat less intractable. When Secretary suggested that 14
                            PermReps be allowed take decision quietly without referral to FonMins,
                            Martin commented: “that is way it is developing.”
                            Martin seemed, however, want suspend judgment until he had talked with
                            Couve Sept 26.</p>

                        <p>Martin said that the problem of Canada “and other small
                            countries” vis-á-visthe United States is that they
                            are forced to talk so much on the periphery of things. All of them are
                            very concerned as to what they say to Uncle Sam and they do not speak
                            frankly, nor do they feel that the United States is completely frank in
                            return.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary disagreed, saying that he had always felt in his talks with
                            Martin that both were being very frank, and that the exchanges they had
                            had were often very lively. Saying that he would take advantage of
                            Martin's emphasis on the desirability of frankness, the
                            Secretary said that he had the impression that Canadian foreign policy
                            did not evolve from a systematic calculation of the kind of world Canada
                            would like to see in its own interest. He thought Canada reacted to
                            situations and tried to find a middle point, but it had no over-all
                            framework within which to make its judgments. The Secretary suggested
                            that it might be useful if discussions could be held between the two <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0748"/>governments at the policy
                            planning level. For example, Canada obviously has interests in Southeast
                            Asia and the outcome of the situation there; likewise Canada has
                            interests in Africa and other areas of the world. A thorough discussion
                            of such things from the standpoint of Canadian interests might lead to
                            conclusions which would be different from what we have seen out of
                            Ottawa so far.</p>
                        <p>Martin noted that he is three-fourths French and that the French are
                            always sensitive about the persons with whom they deal. He had profound
                            respect for the Secretary, and the Secretary should know that the last
                            week, in which Canada seemed to be taking a different line from that of
                            the US, had caused him real agony. However, Martin continued, the
                            Canadians feel that they do not really know the actual plans of the US.
                            Canada is the neighbor of the US and Canadians have a similar origin to
                            Americans; if this were not the case, Canada would probably take a very
                            strong stand against the US. Martin said that the Canadian Government is
                            always under great pressure from the public for being a satellite of the
                            United States. This is a difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he appreciated this, but he asked again what Canadian
                            policy would be if it were enunciated only in Canadian national terms.
                            Martin said that, for one thing, Canada wanted a world where the US and
                            the Soviet Union would be on better relations than is now the case. He
                            felt that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, in the interests of
                            such relations, should take a chance and stop the bombing in North
                            Viet-Nam. Martin said that, in general, the Soviets are developing in
                            the right direction in their society. He cited his talk with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> as being reassuring on this
                            score. Martin continued that the United States could not expect Canada
                            to say “yes” to US policy in every situation. He
                            said that Canada believes in the Commonwealth and believes very strongly
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if this included Article I of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter, providing for collective
                            security. Martin responded affirmatively, although he said that the
                            Canadian people were divided on Viet-Nam, just as the American people.
                            So far as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was concerned, the
                            French population of Canada had nothing to do with Canada's
                            stand on the relocation of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. At the
                            same time, Canada feels close to France, and believes that no steps
                            should be taken which could be interpreted as being against the French
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it is fundamental to the kind of world we want
                            that the US should meet its commitments. The Soviets and the Chinese
                            must see that we mean business; otherwise we could have war.</p>
                        <p>Martin said he understood our policy in Europe and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and he felt this was important. The
                            Secretary commented that what we did in Asia was equally important; we
                            cannot be a virgin in Europe and a whore in the Pacific.</p>
                        <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by stressing again his desire for frank
                            understanding with Canada, and he urged Martin to query us if he had any
                            questions concerning our policies.</p>

                        <p>The Canadian Ambassador called at the Department at the invitation of the
                            Acting Secretary, who handed him an Aide-Mémoire<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Not printed.</note> setting forth, he pointed out,
                            the views of the United States fisheries experts in the form of a
                            proposal for a multilateral agreement which, from our point of view,
                            would provide a rather happier solution to Canada's fisheries
                            problems than would the Canadian proposal for unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired whether the document contained the full draft of
                            a possible agreement. The Acting Secretary responded that there were
                            some interstices but he thought the gaps were not large ones and could
                            be easily worked out. He stressed that he was hopeful the draft would
                            provide a viable alternative solution to the problem. He thought the
                            Aide-Mémoire was a self-contained paper and he only wanted to
                            underline his great hope that it can provide a way out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> also remarked that he
                            understood the matter had been discussed in the last day or so with
                            Foreign Minister Martin in Paris<note n="3" xml:id="d339fn3">Documentation on these discussions is in the National Archives and
                                Records Administration, RG 59, Conference Files: Lot 67 D 586, CF
                                108.</note> but, of course, he did not yet have a full account of
                            that conversation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McKernan commented that there was one other point he hoped the
                            Ambassador would bear in mind. The fisheries experts in Canada and the
                            United States have worked together most successfully for years and he
                            thought he was correct in saying there is a high degree of respect on
                            both sides.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had not had a full account of the most recent
                            technical discussions between the experts of the two countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d339fn4">No record of the meeting, held December 5 in
                                Ottawa, was found.</note> He asked how specific they had been. Had
                            there been a discussion of an actual draft text?</p>
                        <p>Mr. McKernan responded that they had not gotten down to a draft but they
                            had considered cases. They had talked of specific areas and had
                            proceeded to the point where there was reason to believe that our
                            proposal would contribute more to the interests of Canadian fishing than
                            would the Canadian plan since it would deal with greater areas. He noted
                            that the Canadian experts had raised questions of time and plausibility
                            and, in this connection, he said the US experts had made a genuine
                            effort to approach these questions realistically in drawing up the
                            present draft.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed some doubt on the question of time, noting that
                            the draft spoke of 1968 whereas the Canadian intent had been to aim for
                            July 1, 1967. He did not know how Canadian ministers would react to this
                            aspect. The Acting Secretary replied to the effect that, after all, time
                            passes very quickly when one is attempting to achieve major goals. He
                            believed it was better to be conservative than to set an unrealistic
                            date which could not be met. Mr. McKernan added that the US experts had
                            tried hard to be conservative. He was aware, in any event, that the
                            Canadian experts know as much about these problems as we do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Ritchie concluded this part of the conversation by saying he
                            appreciated the effort which had been made and would promptly forward
                            the text to Ottawa where, he was sure, it would receive full
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p>After indicating, in response to a query by Secretary Martin, that he and
                            the President had talked of Vietnam when they were alone, the Prime
                            Minister asked the President about the prospects for shipping Canadian
                            oil in through Chicago. He said, with a smile, that the situation in the
                            Middle East, about which they had been talking at lunch, shows how
                            important it is not to be dependent on Middle East sources of oil.</p>
                        <p>The President responded that he had been talking along these lines only
                            the night before with a group of Texas oilmen.<note n="4" xml:id="d340fn4">According to the President's Daily

                        <p>The Prime Minister remarked jokingly that after all, Canadian oil is all
                            Texas-owned anyway and therefore the money all flows back into the
                            United States in one form or another.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the Executive Branch of the Government was
                            generally more sympathetic than the Congress on matters of this kind.
                            For example, there is considerable pressure right now from the Congress
                            on dairy products; next week it might be meat. In his judgment, this
                            also raised the possibility of not being able to rely on voluntary
                            restraints.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Kennedy Round</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked what effect pressures of this kind would have on
                            the prospects for implementation of the Kennedy Round.</p>
                        <p>The President responded that he thought it was manageable. He recalled
                            that President Franklin Roosevelt had once remarked to him just after
                            his election for a third term that when you get a mandate you ought to
                            execute it within six months.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then wryly asked, “Have you ever had a
                            minority?“</p>
                        <p>The President replied by citing his own experience some years ago when he
                            had encountered a 13-0 vote against him in a committee with a Democratic
                            majority and reminisced about some of his legislative experiences.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated he had been having his own Parliamentary
                            difficulties. He referred to a major debate on Vietnam which had just
                            taken place in the House of Commons. The situation had been difficult
                            for him since there were many, even some in his own party, who were
                            pressing for the Government to oppose U.S. policy. It seemed to him that
                            the bombing of North Vietnam had somehow become a symbol in Canada and
                            in other countries.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, saying that it had become a symbol because of very
                            skillful propaganda. There were, in fact, very superior people in the
                            U.S., too, who were always chanting “stop the
                            bombing.” But one had to remember there are real problems
                            involved. In the first place, we don't want to tie our own
                            hands. In the second place, we have pride too. Why should we always make
                            the unrequited move?</p>
                        <p>The President deplored the one-sided demands which are always made on the
                            United States, particularly since we had already stopped the bombing six
                            times. The only result every time was increased casualties for the U.S.
                            We even tried a cessation of 37 days and nothing came of it. It is
                            always the same. Most recently, we have said we would stop the bombing
                            “if you, Ho Chi Minh, will stop infiltrating.” We
                            had <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0753"/>said we will also stop
                            augmenting, but Ho Chi Minh rejected any such proposal.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated that every time we stop bombing we lose
                            men's lives, our own men's lives, and the blood is
                            on his hands. He said he had recently been taken to task by his
                            daughter's date, a young man who had suffered a severe head
                            wound in Vietnam, for agreeing to pauses in the bombing. These men hold
                            him responsible for the casualties accruing during such pauses.</p>
                        <p>The President went on about the futility of unilateral moves. He said
                            that every time he accedes to such a suggestion he ends up behind his
                            own goal line. Yet, every week we say in some way to the Communist camp
                            that we are willing to stop if we can see the slightest indication of a
                            response from their side.</p>
                        <p>The real trouble is, the President went on, that the enemy
                            won't stop. What they want is Thailand, Laos, and the rest of
                            Southeast Asia. This is a fundamental fact which has to be understood.
                            For that matter, Communist mortars kill more people than our own
                            bombing.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked about the chances of a cease-fire proposal.</p>
                        <p>The President thought the proposal had about as much appeal as a proposal
                            to become a Yankee would have had to his Confederate grandmother.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister admitted that the President was right, but he said
                            that was one of the disadvantages. He could talk this way to the
                            President but he couldn't do so to Ho Chi Minh.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated that last week we had said we were prepared to
                            give up the bombing. But the question always is, what will the other
                            side do? We never get an answer to this question. He thought it perhaps
                            ought to be the price of making a suggestion that it be multilateral, or
                            at least two-sided.</p>
                        <p>The President cited recent reports to the effect that the Middle East now
                            confronts us with a dilemma, i.e., to choose between the Middle East and
                            Vietnam. These were dangerous in both Cairo and Moscow. We could deal
                            with both. He thought there ought to be no misunderstanding whatsoever
                            of our determination regarding Vietnam. We will do what we have to do
                            and we will pay what we have to pay in terms of money, men, and
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that we have fought a limited war with limited
                            objectives. He had maintained this course against the advice of all his
                            military advisers. Our aims are limited. All we want is
                            self-determination. We have over 40 other countries in alliances with us
                            and we will keep our word. We don't want to imperialize or
                            colonize anybody. We are willing to stop, but it has to be both
                            sides.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister interjected that he was not suggesting cessation for a
                            short period. He understood that the President's military
                            advisers would argue as they do. That's their job. But
                            others, he thought, more clearly see that what the U.S. is after is a
                            political and not a military objective.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, but stressed again that cessation can't
                            be unilateral. The North Vietnamese won't even say to their
                            best friends what they might do. He thought it ought also to be
                            recognized that if we offered such a unilateral move and it failed, the
                            situation might be worse.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Martin then asked, “But don't you
                            stand to lose more by perhaps inevitable escalation?” The
                            President responded simply that unilateral appeals carry no weight with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin noted that the Canadian Government's public
                            position was not that there should be a unilateral move on the part of
                            the U.S., and he cited his own four-point proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said his Government was under great pressure in Canada
                            on Vietnam and was trying to stand up to it because they thought they
                            were right in doing so. He asked, however, what about the public stance
                            of the North Vietnamese that they will talk if the United States ceases
                            bombing.</p>
                        <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0754"/>
                        <p>The President responded that he understood the Prime Minister was under
                            pressure and he appreciated his support. He went on to say, however,
                            that he would trade conversation for conversation, but he would not
                            trade bombing for conversation. The U.S. simply cannot stop
                            unilaterally. If he tried to do so he would have a revolution on his
                            hands.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Middle East<note n="5" xml:id="d340fn5">On May 16

                                closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and on May 24 it

                        </p>
                        <p>With apparent reference to the earlier conversation at lunch, the Prime
                            Minister said he thought the best course was to seek quadripartite
                            agreement in the Security Council and that the U.S. should be most
                            careful not to reject efforts toward this end. We must also be careful
                            to avoid a tripartite position opposed by the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. If necessary, the U.S. and U.K. should
                            accept quadripartite talks outside the U.N. French interests parallel
                            those of the U.S. and the U.K. in the Near East. We must seek to
                            strengthen French feeling on this and through them seek the
                            quadripartite position.</p>

                        <p>The President responded that he would consider quadripartite talks only

                        <p>(2) Israeli Foreign Minister Eban told the British that any Israeli
                            “first strike” would be withheld until he returned
                            from his talks in Washington. If nothing had been worked out by then,
                            Israel will have to strike first.</p>

                        <p>Walt:</p>
                        <p>Here is a recap of my side of our telephone conversation this morning in
                            case it may be of any use to you:</p>
                        <p>1. Neither of them can really afford to leave things where they now are.
                            It would be a pity to lose any of the value of the good talk which they
                            had at Harrington Lake.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">See <ref target="#d340">Document 340</ref>.</note> It would be a tragedy
                            if anything were to stand in the way of fully effective collaboration
                            between them. There may not be much time to try to set things
                            straight.</p>
                        <p>—The press is beginning to detect some difference between them
                            as evidenced by stories in the paper this morning.</p>
                        <p>—The President and the Prime Minister may have to collaborate
                            very soon, even before this weekend is out.</p>
                        <p>2. So far as the record is concerned</p>
                        <p>(A) We were not the ones who made the visit so rushed that some loose
                            ends were inevitably left which could give rise to misunderstanding. The
                            unavoidable rushed nature of the visit also meant that press
                            arrangements were less than ideal and in particular that there was
                            little time to prepare any joint communiqué.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of

                        </p>
                        <p>(B) On the night before the visit</p>
                        <p>—The first leak did not come from us. (Apart from anything
                            else we knew nothing of the helicopters mentioned in that first
                            story.)</p>
                        <p>—When a story appeared which you thought should be qualified
                            by some indication from us that the visit was not definite</p>
                        <p>—We got in touch with <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> and
                            other bureaus. This was not without considerable embarrassment for us
                            since the press were bound to think the next day that we had misled them
                            when they were summoned hastily to get to the airport.</p>
                        <p>—During the night we got a message back to the White House
                            Situation Room for you and the President.</p>
                        <p>(C) After the visit, when the first troublesome story came out about the
                            President's alleged intention to propose a Quadripartite
                            meeting, the Prime Minister's office issued a denial which, I
                            understand, was checked out with the White House press office. (Even the
                            first stories out of Ottawa emphasized that no decisions had been
                            made.)</p>
                        <p>(D) In the Prime Minister's statement to the House<note n="4" xml:id="d341fn4">May 25.</note> he answered questions and he seemed
                            to me to confine himself pretty well to either <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0757"/>what the President had said publicly a
                            few days before (right of innocent passage) or what seemed most natural
                            in the Middle East situation (U.N. aspect). (When the Prime Minister
                            spoke about “agreement” he seems pretty clearly to
                            have meant simply agreement of views and not of course any formal
                            agreement.)</p>
                        <p>3. It might be hoped that in view of all that's involved the
                            President might find that after reading the actual text of the exchange
                            in the House of Commons things now look rather different.</p>

                        <p>504. 1. There has been a steady accumulation of evidence in the past few
                            months that the Pearson govt has been working out more policies, at
                            variance with US views and harmful to US interests, which spell a
                            general outlook which, if not anti-American in inspiration, is certainly
                            anti-American in result. Some of these policies have some realistic
                            relationship to Canadian interests; others reflect little more than a
                            yen to yank Uncle Sam's beard, to strike a theatrical and
                            supposedly popular pose at US expense in the leadership race and to
                            embarrass the US by highlighting embarrassing problems, partly with the
                            view to papering over controversy with Quebec.<note n="2" xml:id="d342fn2">Reference is to the Quebec separatist

                        </p>
                        <p>2. On the political side, there is supporting evidence in
                            Canada's recent actions regarding Vietnam, abandonment of
                            private diplomacy, <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0758"/>China, and
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. The <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> govt's failure to
                            make <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> as cooperative a military
                            arrangement as it could have been and its notification it would
                            nationalize certain international waters even over our objections are
                            long-time irritants and will not be further noted.</p>
                        <p>A. Vietnam. For the first time, FonMin Martin called for unilateral
                            cessation of bombing of North Vietnam by US in his speech at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Sept 27.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">For text, see <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> doc. A/PV
                                1569.</note> He even twisted the stiletto, once inserted, by saying
                            in Parliament in response to question that he had advised us beforehand.
                            In fact, he had only given preview of his speech to US officials in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in “general
                            terms.” To add insult to injury, he said in speech on Oct. 13
                            when questioned about Secretary's remarks, expressing concern
                            over what might happen if bombing stopped and Hanoi did nothing, that he
                            could not discuss a hypothetical situation. Of course he had no
                            hesitancy in calling on us to create a hypothetical situation,
                            consequences of which would not be forecast and which Martin has already
                            advised Secretary he would do nothing to meet. In <gloss target="#t_CBC1">CBC</gloss> TV interview Oct. 11, he even fixed
                            blame on US in Vietnam by saying “if the bombing stops, I
                            think then the onus will be on the North. Now the onus is on the US to
                            explain its position to the people of the world.”</p>
                        <p>B. Public diplomacy. In the same TV interview, FonMin Martin also stated
                            that he was, in effect, abandoning his advertised policy of private
                            diplomacy about Vietnam vis-á-vis US. He said Canada had been
                            mistaken in thinking it should not “speak up” to
                            US on subject. Canada had responsibility for action in its capacity as
                            member of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. China. In connection with abortive centennial visit to Ottawa of
                            China's VP Yen, FonMin Martin, even while <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> was trying to put visit by some
                            substitute (eventually Deputy Premier Huang) back on rails, made
                            embarrassing comments to press in Halifax Oct. 1 and 2 on
                            Formosa's not having been Chinese for hundred years and
                            reiterating his one China-one Taiwan policy. This was symptomatic of his
                            present penchant raise embarrassing subject to capitalize upon
                            neutralist public opinion he exploits and encourages.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. After Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> announced US
                            decision to establish thin <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense

                            PriMin Pearson in Parliament whether <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            was advised in advance. Despite agreement between <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> officialdom and Emb that official line
                            would be that US had “consulted” with <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> (as it had, indeed, throughout previous
                            year), PriMin <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said only
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> had been
                            “notified.” This eased him out of any necessity to
                            explain <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> rationale for participation
                            or nonparticipation in system, but gave US cold comfort in permitting
                            belief it had acted somewhat cavalierly in so vital a matter.</p>
                        <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0759"/>
                        <p>3. There are number of indications in economic area which may represent a
                            reinforcing trend toward more divergence between US and Canadian
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>A. The insistence of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> that it would,
                            despite compelling nature of evidence gathered to prove that passage of
                            Bank Act would retroactively discriminate against small American bank in
                            Canada, proceed to limit bank's growth notwithstanding is one
                            example of this trend.</p>
                        <p>B. Similarly, the leftist-oriented economic nationalists of Canada have
                            also placed significant restrictions on advertising of US sources in
                            publications circulated in Canada in effort to weaken bonds of cultural
                            affinity.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> now seems bent on introducing
                            discriminatory postal rates against Time and Reader's Digest
                            to same end.</p>
                        <p>D. Proposed changes in regulation of radio and television in Canada
                            follow similar course, further strengthening Canadian content
                            requirements and regulating cable vision facilities.</p>
                        <p>E. The Carter Commission report<note n="5" xml:id="d342fn5">The report,
                                presented on February 24, called for a complete overhaul of the
                                Canadian taxation system.</note> (on which <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has yet to take a stand), which would revolutionize
                            Canadian tax policy and practice, may also be seen as attempt to stem
                            rising tide of integration of US-Canadian capital markets by
                            establishing disincentives to both US capital investment in Canada and
                            Canadian capital investment in US. Report also urges elimination special
                            incentives to mining and petroleum industries controlled largely by US
                            corporations and points out that this move will shift burden taxation
                            from Canadian to foreign taxpayers.</p>
                        <p>F. Canada's foreign trade policy has for considerable period
                            of time been at substantial variance with that of US as regards trading
                            with Communist countries and particularly with Castro's
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>G. Another evidence of thrust of Canadian economic nationalists appeared
                            in Oct. 14 column of well-informed journalist Peter Newman under title
                            “A Test for English Canadians Nationalist Urges.”
                            According to Newman, the special task force under <persName corresp="#p_GWL1">Walter Gordon</persName>'s chairmanship
                            set up to look into the problems of foreign investment (particularly
                            American), “may become the basis both for a tough new era in
                            Canadian-American relations and a major plank in the Liberal
                            govt's next election platform.” The
                            “senior liberal politicians” cited by Newman as
                            his sources, “see economic nationalism as the kind of issue
                            which might give this country a post-centennial set of objectives on
                            which both French and English politicians could agree.” While
                            Emb <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0760"/>has reported that Newman
                            article contains inaccuracies and is discounted by some officials,
                            article is at least representative of views of economic nationalists in
                            govt.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: There is then this recent record of

                            most visible evidence of this development is in govt Crown Corporation

                            program Sunday night (formerly <hi rend="italic">This Hour Has Seven

                            venomous attacks on US policy and US society. Recent shocker was

                            society as welter of fear, hate, depravity, rot, and disintegration.
                            Individual Canadians are still expressing their concern to Emb over this

                        <p>(The Secretary had on November 2 at a reception mentioned to Ambassador
                            Ritchie that he was troubled by the current state of Canadian-American
                                relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">No record of this
                                conversation was found.</note> As a result of this conversation
                            Ambassador Ritchie had requested an appointment with the Secretary which
                            was granted for November 16.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that he had not had an opportunity to think as
                            much about the state of Canadian relations as he had hoped to in
                            preparation for the Ambassador's call. Ambassador Ritchie
                            asked whether the Secretary thought that US-Canadian relations were
                            still troubled or headed for trouble. The Secretary, with a tone of
                            humor, asked Ambassador Ritchie whether anti-Americanism was good
                            politics in Canada these days. Ambassador Ritchie responded with a
                            strong negative. He indicated that with the exception of Viet-Nam, where
                            there appeared to be a definite difference of opinion over American
                            bombing policy, he saw no real evidence of a deterioration of relations.
                            Indeed he believed that following shortly after the successful
                            conclusion <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0762"/>of the Kennedy

                            relations were indeed good. Many positive steps in this direction were
                            being taken. Among these was the statement in favor of continued
                            cooperation in <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> which had just
                            been made by Mr. Martin.<note n="4" xml:id="d344fn4">In a November 11

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was familiar with Canadian cooperation in the
                            Kennedy Round, Canadian activities in the field of foreign aid, with the
                            value of the auto agreement and with Canadian efforts in the field of
                            foreign exchange reserves. He was also aware of Canadian activities in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping and of a closer
                            relationship with the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries in arriving at a consensus of the 14. There were, however,
                            some specific irritants. The US had thought, for instance, that Canada
                            had been fully consulted on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>; yet
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>'s
                            indication seemed to have been that he had only been informed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Ritchie claimed that the word
                            “consultation” had a special meaning to Canadians,
                            a sort of “folklore” dating to the Mackenzie King
                            days and his relationship with Britain when
                            “consultation” began to mean the equivalent of
                            commitment. He thought the Liberal Government had deliberately shied
                            away from using this expression because of this tradition. Certainly,
                            Canada had been fully informed of US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            plans and the discussions that had been held were much appreciated.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>. The Secretary said he found a difference
                            between public statements and private statements on Viet-Nam. While we
                            had had very good relationships in private, some of the Canadian public
                            statements seemed to him somewhat unnecessary. He particularly referred
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> which he said had been
                            created as a sort of “troika” with one Communist
                            member (Poland), one neutral member (India) and one Western member
                            (Canada). It now seemed to him on occasion that what we had were two
                            neutrals and Poland.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Ritchie would not be drawn into a discussion of Canadian
                            public attitudes on this question. He forcefully stated that in the
                            Commission proceedings themselves, Canada was far from neutral, that
                            Canada had made great efforts at presenting a point of view different
                            from that of the other two but had been thwarted because of Indian
                            intransigence. The Secretary said that when sentiments opposing the
                            American action in Viet-Nam are made in Canada he was particularly
                            concerned because Canada was such a close neighbor.</p>
                        <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0763"/>
                        <p>He felt that with Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand,
                            Australia and New Zealand openly supporting the American point of view
                            and more sub rosa support coming from Laos, Burma and Indonesia, he
                            would hope that this vast interest of friendly Asian countries might be
                            reflected in the public attitudes taken by the Canadian Government. He
                            recalled that he had been startled when Foreign Minister Martin said to
                            him in private during his last visit that if there were a resolution in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> calling on the US unilaterally to
                            halt its bombing, Mr. Martin would have to vote for it.<note n="5" xml:id="d344fn5">Apparently a reference to Martin's

                            that Mr. Martin had reflected what he believed was Canadian public
                            opinion and what he thought might bring about genuine negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether anyone in the Canadian Government had
                            commented on the President's San Antonio formula.<note n="6" xml:id="d344fn6">For text of President Johnson's

                                876-881.</note> Ambassador Ritchie asked what might have been a
                            useful comment on the part of the Canadian Government. The Secretary
                            responded that a call to Hanoi to respond affirmatively to the
                            President's offer might have been appropriate. Ambassador
                            Ritchie thought that this type of statement had been made on many
                            occasions. He said Canadian opinion was very strong on this subject and
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, contrary to
                            some of the European leaders, was associated in some Canadian minds with
                            the President as demonstrated by the fact that he had been picketed when
                            he recently spoke at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Aeroflot</hi>. The Secretary then mentioned that he had
                            not known of the outcome of the Aeroflot negotiations between Canada and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> when he last spoke to
                            Ambassador Ritchie. He had been troubled by the possibility that so
                            shortly after the OAS had passed its resolution asking the friends of
                            Latin America to help it in containing Castro, the Canadian Government
                            was about to give a refueling stop at Gander to the Soviet Union. He
                            didn't think that Cuba was that important to Canada.
                            Ambassador Ritchie said that this had not been a matter of
                            Cuba's importance to Canada, rather that what had motivated
                            Canada was the desire to obtain a substantial quid-pro-quo in
                            hard-headed civil aviation negotiations. Canada would only have given
                            the rights at Gander if it had obtained access to some remote airport in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in return. This question was
                            on the shelf for the time being and would not be re-raised unless some
                            new elements were thrown into the pot.</p>

                                up a committee chaired by <persName corresp="#p_GWP1">Gordon

                                Canadian industry.</note> The Secretary asked when the Gordon study
                            would be completed. Ambassador Ritchie thought that while the study
                            might be completed in the next few weeks it should not be viewed as an
                            anti-American document. While Minister <persName corresp="#p_GWL1">Gordon</persName> might have his own attitudes there were others in
                            the Canadian Government, notably Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName>, who disagreed with him and in any case the Gordon
                            study was not necessarily government policy.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Restrictions on Turkey Imports</hi>. The Secretary then
                            mentioned the restrictions on the imports of American turkeys.
                            Ambassador Ritchie said that there had been consultations on the subject
                            and that a statement was about to be issued. Mr. Straus indicated that
                            while there had been consultations they had not led to any agreement and
                            it was perhaps the circumstances under which the negotiations were
                            initiated as much as anything else that had proved to be an irritant.
                            Ambassador Ritchie readily agreed and said that he thought that there
                            would be problems because, as the Secretary smilingly pointed out, the
                            Chairman of the Appropriations Committee as well as the Leader of the
                            Opposition were representatives of turkey producing states.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Postal Rate Discrimination</hi>. Speaking of the
                            question of postal rate restrictions against the American magazines Time
                            and Reader's Digest, the Secretary asked Ambassador Ritchie
                            whether the contemplated postal rate action was not another example of
                            protectionism. Ambassador Ritchie indicated that postal rates for Time
                            and Reader's Digest would be increased and that this was
                            being done to protect Canadian periodicals which would otherwise go down
                            the drain. He said that the proportion of Canadian periodicals to
                            non-Canadian periodicals circulating in Canada was already so
                            disproportionate that there was practically no possibility for an
                            expression of a Canadian point of view and that it was, therefore,
                            necessary to take some action to prevent the possibility of the Canadian
                            periodicals being driven off the market altogether. There had to be some
                            room for the expression of Canadian views even on a subject such as
                            Viet-Nam where some Canadian views might well differ with those
                            expressed in US publications.</p>
                        <p>In summary, however, Ambassador Ritchie felt that we were doing more
                            together these days than we had ever done before and that Canada would
                            not be in the business of building dams in western Canada as a
                            cooperative venture with the US if US-Canadian relationships were really
                            headed for trouble.</p>

                            role, the Secretary wondered whether the Canadians had a man in Phnom
                            Penh. Ambassador Ritchie <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0765"/>replied in the affirmative but indicated that a Canadian
                            representative had been most frustrated in seeking to inspect
                            infiltration into Viet-Nam through Cambodia because of the Indian
                            refusal to accept anything except a unanimous decision by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. He wondered whether the
                            Secretary's question was based on the fact that current
                            attacks on American troops in Viet-Nam seemed to be based in Cambodia.
                            He also asked whether the US was thinking of following through on its
                            theory of hot pursuit. The Secretary said that the situation was very
                            difficult, that the troops attacking Dak To obviously came from Cambodia
                            and would probably return there but that proof was difficult to obtain.
                            Ambassador Ritchie offered to have the Canadian representative in Phnom
                            Penh be of any assistance that he could possibly be and invited the
                            Secretary to call him in this regard.</p>

                            Ritchie what he thought of its current status. Ambassador Ritchie
                            thought that US-Canadian cooperation on this study had been quite good,
                            that the 14 seemed to be working well together. The Secretary thought
                            that it was important that the study itself not be watered down. While
                            we might be flexible as to procedure and not confront the French with a
                            vote, it seemed to him that it was important to have made the study and
                            it was important not to dissipate the work that had been done. In this
                            connection he asked Ambassador Ritchie whether there were continued
                            pressures in Canada for Canada to reduce its commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Ambassador Ritchie indicated that
                            while the pressures were still present, Minister Martin had in his
                            speech in Toronto sought to restate the Canadian commitment and had done
                            so effectively. Ambassador Ritchie added that Mr. Martin had also said
                            in that speech that no power had the right to intervene in the affairs
                            of another country without the authorization of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and had been misquoted as having directed
                            this statement at US policy in Viet-Nam. He had officially denied this.
                            The Secretary indicated that he had received Mr. Martin's
                            personal denial to our Embassy at Ottawa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that he would see Foreign Minister Martin in
                                Brussels<note n="9" xml:id="d344fn9">November 12-16.</note> and talk
                            with him there and that he might follow-up with Ambassador Ritchie when

                        <p>Subject of Vietnam occupied major part of Secretary's talk
                            with Martin December 11. Referring to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            possibilities, Secretary emphasized uncertainties of resort to Security
                            Council. For example, he would prefer that Canada vote against
                            inscription at beginning rather than find itself in position of having
                            to vote in favor of resolution on unilateral bombing pause, but
                            Secretary agreed that US could accept simple resolution on return to
                            1954 agreements.<note n="2" xml:id="d345fn2">Efforts to engage the

                                a result of lack of support for discussion of the issue in the
                                Security Council. The National Liberation Front rejected the use of
                                the Security Council as a forum.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Martin said Belgian Foreign Minister Harmel had suggested to him December
                            11, that UNSC might discuss matter and then recommend mediator or
                            representative of UNSYG be appointed. Secretary said US would not
                            necessarily object; there are so many people active that one more would
                            probably not get in the way. Martin thought Communist countries would
                            probably not accept Harmel suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Martin then raised suggestion by Japanese Foreign Minister Miki. Although
                            Canada had little confidence in Miki approach, Martin wondered if US
                            would object to Canada raising subject with Poles. Secretary replied
                            that US attitude is not to discourage anyone. Martin said Canada would
                            continue to consult other countries before raising with Poles, and in
                            any event wished to show a willingness to examine the Japanese idea.</p>
                        <p>Martin then referred to letter from Bebler who wished to stimulate
                            meeting of Co-Chairmen and three <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            countries. Canada and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> accepted, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and Mrs. Gandhi
                            refused on grounds that there could be no negotiations while bombing of
                            North continues. Bebler then tried to get around this obstacle by
                            proposing an agreement that hostilities would “begin to
                            stop” on a given date. Martin and <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> thought it worth asking us whether such approach
                            had any merit, i.e. that US would agree to stop bombing on such a given
                            date.</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied that President's San Antonio formulation
                            gave US minimum position: Assurance of prompt and productive talks, US
                                <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0767"/>means something like three
                            days and not three to six weeks. Hanoi reply was flat
                            “no,” without even exploring meaning of US
                            position. Secretary noted Hanoi in process of moving two new divisions
                            south, and said Hanoi understands clearly what US means by not taking a
                            military advantage. Communist “fight and
                            negotiate” strategy means they seek to obtain cessation of
                            bombing and then continue their military action.</p>
                        <p>When Martin inquired about possibility of bombing pause between Christmas
                            and Tet, Secretary doubted that even if possibility existed, South
                            Vietnam would wish to announce in advance. This would merely give Hanoi
                            opportunity to make [illegible] preparations for intensive reinforcement
                            and supply of units in South.</p>
                        <p>Martin then suggested that such a pause just before UNSC consideration
                            could be meaningful; those opposing bombing would be faced with fact
                            that bombing had stopped. This would force alteration of strategy for
                            some countries, including Canada. Secretary replied that any pause would
                            bring immediate question from Hanoi as to whether it has permanent and
                            unconditional cessation. Since US would not answer this question, Hanoi
                            would label the cessation “an ultimatum.”</p>
                        <p>Martin then discussed possibility of trying to keep Sihanouk quiet.
                            Secretary pointed out that there is over one Communist division in
                            Cambodia, and at least one major facility in northeast corner of
                            country. We have provided information on Communist military activities
                            out of Cambodia to Sihanouk, and he has been more quiet since.</p>
                        <p>Martin then raised question of safety of Canadian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> personnel in Hanoi. Seaborn has become greatly
                            concerned in recent days and also fears for Canadian courier plane.
                            Seaborn reported that “it may be necessary to reassess our
                            situation.” Secretary pointed out that US does not bomb Gia
                            Lam Airport; that we use great care in bombing; and that some problems
                            may be caused by “trigger-happy” people on the
                            ground. Nevertheless, he asked Martin to provide detailed information as
                            to location of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Canadians in
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>On subject of Eastern European states' relations with Hanoi,
                            Secretary noted that Yugoslavia is not particularly good channel, and
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that none
                            of Eastern Europeans are effective.</p>

                            specific measures which are of direct concern to us.</p>
                        <p>The strength of the United States economy and the stability of its
                            currency are of fundamental importance to us in Canada as indeed to the
                            whole world. We have regarded participation with you and others in
                            international efforts to assure a healthy framework for the world
                            economy as one of the most constructive endeavours of the past few
                            years. As you know, our bilateral trade and payment relationship has
                            been a net source of strength to you. We have also tried to pursue
                            policies contributing to easing current problems, for example, by the
                            gold sales we have made to you over the past couple of years.</p>
                        <p>For our part, I would like to express my appreciation of the very evident
                            efforts which have been made in your new programme to take account of
                            the special position of Canada. Your programme will of course have to be
                            carefully examined, as it evolves, before a full assessment of its
                            implications for Canada can be made. Some direct limitation on the
                            freedom of action of Canadian companies appears inevitable and this is
                            bound to cause great concern. The Minister of Finance is in touch with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> on some of the
                            more immediate problems. In this letter, I limit my comments to a rather
                            different issue of great international importance, the question of
                            border taxes. Should the United States feel it must take action to
                            establish a system of import taxes and export rebates, or similar
                            measures of a kind which I understand you may be considering, Canada
                            would be obliged to take parallel measures in order to leave our
                            competitive position in world trade unchanged. In the face of some
                            public uneasiness here this has been publicly stated by members of the
                            Canadian government and our position is understood by your officials;
                            just as we understand yours.</p>
                        <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0769"/>
                        <p>It seems to me, however, that it would be preferable to submit this
                            general subject for international consideration and, in particular, that
                            some re-examination of the international rules would be timely and would
                            avoid the danger of misunderstanding leading to competitive action. I
                            know that you now have this matter under consideration and I hope that,
                            if you determine that some action by the United States is required, you
                            will place proposals before the appropriate international bodies for
                            consideration before taking such action. I believe that in this way we
                            can avoid a cumulative process of action and counter-action whose
                            consequences would be very damaging not only to the gains achieved
                            through the Kennedy Round but also to the whole system of international
                            trade and payments created under United States leadership since the

                            to go over the problems facing the Canadian dollar. (His visit to

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> said the Canadian dollar had
                            come under pressure because of:</p>
                        <p>—the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> devaluation;</p>
                        <p>—the anticipated effects of the U.S. balance of payments

                        <p>—misinterpretation of the U.S. program.</p>
                        <p>Pressure was heavy in January; it quieted down after issuance of the
                            Treasury statement explaining the limited impact of the U.S. program on
                                Canada;<note n="2" xml:id="d347fn2">Not found.</note> and it flared
                            up again during the Canadian Government crisis last week.<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">On December 14, 1967, <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> announced that he would retire as soon as
                                the Liberal Party chose a successor. The party called a meeting for
                                April 4-6 to elect a new leader.</note> Since January 1, the
                            Government used up $900 million, or 1/3 of its reserves, to support the
                            Canadian dollar.</p>
                        <p>U.S. consideration of balance of payments trade measures posed an
                            additional problem:</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> said that if we
                            imposed an import surcharge, the Canadians would have to devalue since
                            they had no feasible way to offset it.</p>
                        <p>—If we imposed a border tax (export subsidy and import
                            surcharge), the effect on their exchange market would probably be
                            manageable, since they have already announced publicly that they would
                            match whatever we did. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> believes that any measure in this area would not
                            be in our interest. It could not benefit our balance of payments very
                            much, and could set off a wave of retaliatory measures whose ultimate
                            effect on trade and confidence no one could accurately foresee.</p>
                        <p>In appraising the general situation confronting the Canadian dollar,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> said that
                            Canada's cost and price problems were manageable and the
                            Government wanted to avoid devaluation. To maintain the rate, however,
                            it was essential to reverse the growing belief that the Canadian dollar
                            could not hold. He asked <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>
                            to consider two measures:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">exemption of Canadian investment from the
                                balance of payments program</hi>. Even though the program does not
                            bear heavily on Canada, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> said
                            that an exemption would have an important psychological effect.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">an ExIm Bank line of credit of $1
                                billion</hi>—he said they would not intend to use it but
                            its existence would be strong evidence of Canadian determination to hold
                            the rate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> said that whatever we could
                            do to help would not be a balance of payments drain for us because of
                            our bilateral reserve arrangement. <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0771"/>He argued that the U.S. can neither gain nor lose
                            reserves in dealing with Canada.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> explained our
                            problems with an outright exemption of Canada from the investment
                            program, asked <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> to consider
                            what we could do together in the border tax area, and said we would go
                            over their requests and give them an early answer.</p>
                        <p>We have begun to explore the possibilities of:</p>
                        <p>—an ExIm standby credit as part of a multilateral support
                            operation with the Europeans;</p>
                        <p>—a statement of intent that we would re-examine our investment
                            guidelines for Canada if they were proving to be a serious problem for
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>We will have firm recommendations for you after looking into these
                            possibilities.</p>

                            measures.</p>
                        <p>1. In considering possible US import surcharge Embassy suggests following
                            factors relating US-Canadian trade might usefully be taken into
                            account:</p>
                        <p>A. While exclusion of duty-free trade very helpful in limiting impact any
                            US measure on Canadian exports, flat rate surcharge applying only
                            dutiable items would still strike heavily and unfairly at Canada. Based
                            on limited statistics available Embassy, US average rate on dutiable
                            imports from Canada 6 percent (1964) compared to 13 percent <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0772"/>for <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>,
                            15 percent for <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> and higher for
                            Japan. Flat surcharge of, say, 6 percent would double tariff for Canada
                            but be only two-fifths increase for <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. Result could well lead to charges of inequitable
                            burden sharing.</p>
                        <p>B. Surcharge related to underlying tariff rate would obviate this
                            difficulty to some extent. To have equivalent import dampening effect, a
                            surcharge would have to be steep, perhaps 50 percent increase in basic
                            rate. Result would average 9 percent on Canada and 22-1/2 percent on
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss>. Case can be made that trade
                            disruption might nevertheless be more serious for Canada than for
                            Europe; dutiable imports from Canada contain relatively larger share
                            semi-manufactures and raw materials as result North American economic
                            integration. This trade generally operates on low margins through
                            established trade channel and competes with US production. Thus any
                            trade diversion could produce lasting injury. Moreover, in calculating
                            protective effect of surcharge on value added in manufacturing,
                            protection derived from rate relationships remains unchanged and
                            excessive protection on semi-manufactures avoided under this formula.
                            Such “tariff rate surcharge” would also have
                            economic advantage for us in limiting inflationary impact on US
                            manufacturing costs.</p>
                        <p>2. Embassy suggests: as equitable burden for Canada in possible surcharge
                            situation, rate related to underlying tariff on dutiable imports but
                            with exemption for rates scheduled for duty elimination under Kennedy
                            Round. Consequently surcharge coverage for Canada would be reduced by
                            $480 million (1964) to $1.2 billion out of total $4 billion of US
                            imports from Canada. Of this, the substantial petroleum imports from
                            Canada (just under $400 million in 1967) would not be significantly
                            affected since trade not regulated by tariffs. Thus we could reasonably
                            claim that although nearly 70 percent of Canada's exports go
                            to US, the burden of the US tariff increase would not be greater on its
                            economy than for other countries. For example, Japan would face this
                            surcharge on approximately 25 percent of its total exports while for
                            Canada it would be less than 20 percent, taking petroleum into account.
                            While Embassy would not predict that this approach would persuade <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> not to take reciprocal offsetting
                            measures against US, it might be helpful to this end. Additionally, such
                            a formula would provide “non-discriminatory” means
                            of reducing scope of action for <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s in light our significant use TEA<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">For text of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, P.L.

                        <p>3. Still another alternative would be to invoke principle of TEA Section
                            202 to exempt from surcharge all rates below 5 percent. This <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0773"/>might prove more difficult
                            presentationally with third countries however.</p>
                        <p>4. If tariff rate surcharge along lines (2) above likely provoke protests
                            as increasing tariff disparities, combination could be considered. This
                            might be in form of flat rate surcharge of, say 8 percent, but only up
                            to maximum of 50 percent of underlying tariff rate. Effect is to ease
                            burden on both very high and low rates.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Sharp</persName> noted that in the course
                            of the foreign policy review which his government is undertaking,<note n="2" xml:id="d349fn2">On April 6 the Liberal Party elected Pierre

                            China question would be re-examined. The Canadian public, he observed,
                            thinks its government should look very hard at the question of whether
                            there is a way of getting <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0774"/>China
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without forcing Taiwan out.
                            The question of Canadian recognition would also arise. He inquired
                            whether the Secretary saw any change in the US position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that we had
                            made a number of efforts to increase contacts with the Chinese
                            Communists in a variety of fields. Peking, however, always takes the
                            position that before any progress can be made we must abandon Formosa.
                            He wondered, therefore, if this did not provide the answer to Mr.
