                <p>The Department of State released August 8, 2001 <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations of the United States</hi>, 1964–1968, Volume XXVI, Indonesia;
                    Malaysia-Singapore; Philippines. This volume, part of the ongoing official
                    record of American foreign policy, presents the record of the policy of the
                    administration of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> toward these three nations during a period of transition
                    in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>The largest compilation, on U.S. relations with Indonesia, presents documents on
                    one of the most turbulent eras of Indonesia's history since it gained its
                    independence from the Netherlands. During 1964 and much of 1965, Indonesian
                    President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> continued his
                    policy of confrontation against the Federation of Malaysia. The United States
                    sought to mediate this territorial dispute, which had flared into low-level
                    guerrilla warfare, while at the same time the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration grappled with the question of continuing U.S. economic aid to
                    Indonesia. The Partai Komus Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>), the
                    Indonesian Communist Party, became increasingly powerful under <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and its anti-American
                    demonstrations and attacks on U.S. facilities severely strained U.S.-Indonesia
                    relations.</p>
                <p>After some initial confusion, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration
                    concluded in early October 1965 that an attack led by junior military officers
                    against key anti-Communist members of the Indonesian military leadership was
                    aided and encouraged by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and constituted
                    an attempt to overthrow the government and establish a <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>-dominated regime. This short-lived coup, known as “Gestapu” —
                    the Indonesian contraction of the term, “30th of September Movement” — set off a
                    counter reaction by the military, which over a period of months resulted in the
                    deaths of large numbers of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> members,
                    eliminated <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence in Indonesia, and
                    resulted in the replacement of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Indonesia's policy of international non-alignment, coupled
                    with close association with the Sino-Soviet bloc, changed to one of
                    non-alignment with close contacts with the West. The documents printed in the
                    volume reveal the role that the United States played in encouraging the
                    anti-Communist elements in Indonesia during the difficult transition from
                        <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. The final portion of the compilation
                    highlights the improvement in U.S. relations with the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government and U.S. and international efforts to
                    stabilize the Indonesian economy after the dislocation of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> years.</p>
                <p>Singapore's August 1965 withdrawal from the Malaysian Federation caused a
                    temporary problem for U.S. policy. The <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration believed that it had to maintain good relations with Malaysia and
                    establish a new relationship with the city-state of Singapore and its dynamic
                    leader, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee Kwan Yew</persName>. The volume's
                    documents show that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    worked hard at being even-handed with Malaysia, but he developed a close
                    personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee Kwan Yew</persName>,
                    a staunch supporter of <persName>Johnson</persName>'s policy in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The compilation on the Philippines covers the beginning of the era of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Ferdinand Marcos</persName>, with his victory over Diosado
                    Macapagal in the Philippine presidential elections in November 1965. For almost
                    the first time, the United States had no clear preference in the contest,
                    considering both men to be capable and pro-American. After his impressive
                    victory, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was hailed as a potential
                    political force in Asia by some <persName>Johnson</persName> advisers, but it
                    became increasingly clear that economic problems, ineffective reforms,
                    corruption, and the growing strength of the nation's Communists were taking
                    their toll on his administration. By the end of 1968, U.S. intelligence analysts
                    and the U.S. Embassy were quite pessimistic about Marcos and the future of U.S.
                    relations with his government.</p>

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is responsible for the preparation of the Foreign
                    Relations series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, under the direction
                    of the General Editor of the Foreign Relations series, plans, researches,
                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State Frank B.
                    Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26, 1925. These
                    regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the Foreign Relations series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the Foreign Relations series be
                    published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of the subseries of the Foreign Relations series that
                    documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the last five years
                    of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34 print volumes a documentary
                    record of the major foreign policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. This volume presents
                    the documentary record of U.S. policy toward and relations with Indonesia,
                    Malaysia-Singapore, and the Philippines. Other volumes in the 1964–1968
                    subseries with related material are Volumes I–VII, all on Vietnam; Volume
                    XXVIII, Laos; and Volume XXVII, Mainland Southeast Asia; Regional Affairs.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign
                    Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XXVI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume of the Foreign Relations series the editor, in
                    consultation with the General Editor, determined the particular issues and
                    topics to be documented either in detail, in brief, or in summary. The editor of
                    the volume focused on selecting documentation that illuminated responsibility
                    for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. Government, with primary emphasis
                    on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and his key
                    advisers. The result is a selection of documents which includes memoranda and
                    records of discussion that set forth policy issues and options and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution, rather than on the
                    details of implementation.</p>
                <p>The Department of State, the staff of the White House, as well as the Department
                    of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency also played key roles in formulating
                    and shaping U.S. policy, and their roles are also documented. Their advice and
                    recommendations are found in telegrams from the Embassies, from the Military
                    Advisory Groups, and in intelligence assessments. The dialogue between the
                    Embassies and the Department of State comprises the core of this volume. Most of
                    the finished intelligence included in this volume relates to Indonesia during
                    the transition of power from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                    to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and on the Philippines under
                    President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. Finally, the volume
                    covers covert political action policy in general, especially in the Indonesia
                    compilation.</p>
                <p>Research and compilation of this volume was completed in 1997. The compilation on
                    Indonesia is divided into four sections which define the focus of the coverage.
                    The first, entitled,” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                    Confrontation with Malaysia, January–November 1964,” documents U.S. efforts to
                    mediate and encourage a settlement of the dispute between Indonesia and the
                    Federation of Malaysia over Indonesian claims to North Borneo and to convince
                    Indonesia to desist from its policy of confrontation (confrontasi). Above all,
                    the United States sought to prevent the sporadic low-level guerrilla war
                    Indonesia was waging against Malaysia from escalating into more serious
                    conflict. In addition, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and his advisers grappled with the related problem of whether to use U.S. aid to
                    Indonesia to try to moderate <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s campaign of confrontasi. The next section,” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s Confrontation With the United
                    States, December 1964–September 1965,” documents the deterioration of
                    U.S.-Indonesia relations and the rise of the influence of the Communist Party of
                    Indonesia (Partai Komus Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>)) within
                    the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> government. The third
                    section, “Coup and Counter Reaction, October 1965–March 1966,” is the heart of
                    the compilation and documents in more detail the problems faced by the United
                    States during a period of great transition in Indonesia. The final section, “The
                        <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>United States and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, April 1966–December 1968,” documents
                    the return of U.S.-Indonesia relations to a more conventional state and the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration's primary consideration of
                    strengthening Indonesia economically.</p>
                <p>The small compilation on Malaysia-Singapore is initially an account of the U.S.
                    reaction to the separation of Malaysia and Singapore, which took the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration by surprise. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was careful to maintain good relations
                    with both states, and he visited Kuala Lumpur in 1966. It was Singapore
                    President <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee Kwan Yew</persName>, however, with
                    whom <persName>Johnson</persName> identified most closely, and he (and Vice
                    President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> as well) developed a
                    close personal relationship with President <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>. This special bond is reflected in the selected
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>The Philippines and the United States had a special relationship. The
                    long-standing bilateral issues left over from World War II are covered only when
                    they required a Presidential decision. The question of Philippines claims to the
                    Malaysian territories of Sabah was a complicating factor for the United States,
                    but it never reached a point of actual conflict. It is handled only as a
                    secondary issue. The primary focus of the compilation is on a number of themes
                    that are not exclusive to the Philippines, but which dominated the thinking of
                    U.S. policymakers. The first is the fate of democracy, especially during the
                    Presidential elections of November 1965. The related question of corruption and
                    reform also dominated U.S. efforts in the Philippines. The Philippines
                    contribution of an engineering battalion to the war effort in Vietnam is
                    documented in detail because the policy of “more flags in Vietnam” became
                    increasingly important to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. The selection of documentation also reveals an initial
                    enthusiasm for the newly-elected President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Ferdinand
                        Marcos</persName> and the growing concern over his and the Philippines
                    economic performance. A final theme is the realization that the Communist
                    insurgency in the Philippines was on the rise and <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> seemed unwilling or unable to combat it.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General
                    Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editor for each document included
                    in the <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>volume. Spelling, capitalization,
                    and punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in
                    the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                    monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises
                    on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. Although
                    the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual
                    volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall process and makes
                    recommendations on particular problems that come to its attention.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review, which began in
                    1996, was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive
                    Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws. The
                    principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject
                    only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law and
                    regulation. Declassification decisions entailed the concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, completed in 2000, resulted in
                    the decision to withhold 2.5 percent of the material selected for publication; 7
                    documents were denied in full. The decision on key intelligence issues was
                    appealed to a High-Level Panel consisting of senior representatives from the
                    Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, established in 1997 to determine whether or not a covert activity could
                    be acknowledged by the United States. The Panel arrived at a determination that
                    resulted in the release of some but not all of the appealed documentation.</p>
                <p>In the Indonesia compilation three documents were denied in full (180, 182, and
                    221) and three documents were released with major excisions (167, 175, and 181).
                    These denials and excisions were made on the grounds that release of the
                    information would reveal intelligence sources or methods, disclosure of which
                    would “clearly and demonstrably” damage U.S. national security interests, as
                    allowed in Executive Order 12958. Despite these denials and excisions of
                    specific sources and methods as well as details of implementation, the broad
                    outline of the limited U.S. covert policy in Indonesia is documented in the
                    compilation. Two documents in the compilation on Malaysia-Singapore (269 and
                    286) were also denied to protect intelligence sources and methods. In the
                    Philippines compilation, two documents were denied in full, again on the grounds
                    of intelligence sources and methods. Despite the withheld information, the
                    editor, the General Editor, and the Historian believe that the documentation and
                    editorial notes printed in the volume comprise a thorough, accurate, and
                    reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant
                    diplomatic activity.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the Foreign
                    Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S.
                    Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments, and other
                    entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with the Department of State Historian
                    by providing full access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and
                    actions and by providing copies of selected records. This access is further
                    defined in formal agreements concluded between the Historian and the various
                    relevant agencies. The editors believe that in terms of access this volume was
                    prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of this statute and the
                    implementing agreements.</p>
                <p>The editor had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; the files of overseas diplomatic posts; and the sensitive
                    intelligence files of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. All the
                    Department's indexed central files for these years have been permanently
                    transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at
                    College Park, Maryland. Most of the Department's decentralized office (or lot)
                    files covering this period, which the National Archives deems worthy of
                    permanent retention, have also been transferred from the Department's custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series have had full access to the papers of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and other White House
                    foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have full access to records of the Department
                    of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanding access to
                    Department of State historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records in the custody of that Agency. This access is arranged and facilitated
                    by the History Staff of the Center for the <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0014"/>Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to
                    a May 1992 memorandum of understanding. The Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians work together to identify the key
                    portions of the Agency's intelligence records that had an impact on U.S. foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the Foreign
                    Relations series thanks to the consent of these agencies, the assistance of
                    their staffs, and especially the cooperation and support of the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XXVI</p>
                <p>While different files from specific sources proved useful for the compilations in
                    this volume, some general observations can be made. For all compilations, the
                    subject-numeric Department of State Central files were most important single
                    source, followed closely by records from the Johnson Library. Of the Department
                    of State Central Files, the primary file for the U.S. concern about Indonesian
                    confrontation against Malaysia is <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–1
                    INDON–MALAYSIA. An important file, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> INDON–US
                    (and its variant <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 INDON–US), is useful for
                    the full range of the U.S.-Indonesian relationship. During the period of
                    transition from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, from late October 1965 to March 1966,
                        <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–9 is an important file. The
                    Department of State material on Malaysia and Singapore comes from a number of
                    files, but <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 MALAYSIA (the visits files) is
                    the most cited. The best overall Central file for the Philippines is <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> US–PHIL (and its variant <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 US–PHIL). Documentation on the Philippines'
                    contribution to the war effort in Vietnam is in <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET S, but many documents are misfiled in the far larger
                    general file on the Vietnam war, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S.
                    These are only the most widely cited files from the Department of State. The
                    list at the end of this note includes all other Department of State files cited
                    in the volume.</p>
                <p>The Johnson Library contains the single best set of materials relating to
                    Presidential and White House interest in the area, especially the Country Files
                    in the National Security File: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the
                    Philippines. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert Komer</persName> was the White
                    House staffer most concerned with the area and his files in the National
                    Security File are an important collection. The Memos to the President file in
                    the National Security File is also of value, especially for the Philippines.
                    Documentation on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                    interest in “More Flags in Vietnam” is in a subsection of the Vietnam Country
                    File (5 (D) 9, Allied Troop Commitments and Other Aid) in the National Security
                    File. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>'s telephone
                    conversation files, a separate private collection at the Johnson Library, reveal
                    much about U.S. confusion during and just after the Gestapu coup in Indonesia.
                    The list at the end of this note includes these and all other Johnson Library
                    files cited in the volume.</p>
                <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0015"/>
                <p>Because of the strong Department of Defense interest and presence in the
                    Philippines and Indonesia, the records of the Secretary of Defense (various OSD
                    files) and the records of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
                    Security Affairs (various <gloss target="#t_OASD1">OASD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> files) were particularly useful. The
                    compilation on Indonesia contains the most intelligence-related documentation
                    because of the challenge that the turmoil in Indonesia presented to intelligence
                    analysts and because of the limited covert operations there.
                    Intelligence-related material in this volume comes from the files of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, including the Deputy Directorate for Operations, the
                    Directorate for Intelligence, and the Director's files; the unretired historical
                    files of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL); the retired <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> finished
                    intelligence files for East Asia and the Pacific; the 5412 and 303 Committee
                    records at the National Security Council; and the records at the Johnson
                    Library.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians had full access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations,
                    which are held in the Johnson Library. Tapes constitute only a small portion of
                    the documents, but they are a good indication of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> concerns and interests. The transcripts
                    or extracts of transcripts prepared by the editor are not a substitute for
                    listening to the tapes, where nuances of voice and inflection can be discerned.
                    The tapes provide unique insights into President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s thinking and personal relations with his advisers. The
                    Johnson Library is now in the process of releasing the entire collection of
                    tapes.</p>

                <p>In compliance with the Foreign Relations of the United States statute to include
                    in the Foreign Relations series comprehensive documentation on major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions, the editors have sought to present essential
                    documents regarding major covert actions and intelligence activities. The
                    following note will provide readers with some organizational context on how
                    covert actions and special intelligence operations in support of U.S. foreign
                    policy were planned and approved within the U.S. Government. It describes, on
                    the basis of previously-declassified documents, the changing and developing
                    procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower, <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, and <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidencies.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Management of Covert Actions in the Truman Presidency</p>
                <p>The Truman administration's concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A of December 1947, the launching of peacetime covert action
                    operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A made the Director of Central
                    Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the same
                    time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>)
                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could
                    be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="actionsstatementfn1">

                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s early use of its new covert action mandate
                    dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The Department
                    of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone and concerned that the military might
                    create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen the
                    issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    directive, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, superseded <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A.</p>
                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any
                    US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and
                    that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility
                    for them.”</p>
                <pb n="XXXIV" xml:id="pg_XXXIV" facs="0034"/>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
                    demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
                    assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [sic] groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in
                    threatened countries of the free world. Such operations should not include armed
                    conflict by recognized military forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover
                    and deception for military operations.”<note n="2" xml:id="actionsstatementfn2">

                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on September 1, 1948, in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, assumed responsibility for organizing and
                    managing covert actions. OPC, which was to take its guidance from the Department
                    of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime, initially had direct
                    access to the State Department and to the military without having to proceed
                    through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s administrative hierarchy, provided
                    the Director of Central Intelligence (<gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>) was
                    informed of all important projects and decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="actionsstatementfn3">Memorandum of conversation by Frank G. Wisner,

                    this arrangement was modified to ensure that policy guidance came to OPC through

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s activities. Concerned about
                    this situation, <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> Walter Bedell Smith in early
                    1951 asked the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for enhanced policy guidance
                    and a ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations. The White House responded with two initiatives. In
                    April 1951 President Truman created the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under
                    the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to coordinate government-wide
                    psychological warfare strategy. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5, issued
                    in October 1951, reaffirmed the covert action mandate given in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 and expanded <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s authority over guerrilla warfare.<note n="4" xml:id="actionsstatementfn4">

                    abolished by the incoming Eisenhower administration, but the expansion of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s covert action writ in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/5 helped ensure that covert action would remain a major
                    function of the Agency.</p>
                <p>As the Truman administration ended, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was near

                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s latitude in 1954. In accordance with a series of National
                    Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of Central
                    Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.

                    15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency's responsibility for
                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> was made responsible for coordinating
                    with designated representatives of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of

                    consistent with U.S. foreign and military policies; and the Operations

                    for covert operations among State, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
                    Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance of major covert action

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s request and submitted a report in June which
                    recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert operations. As a result
                    of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the President's Special
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                        Bundy</persName>, and including Deputy Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>, Deputy Secretary of Defense
                    Roswell Gilpatric, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, and Chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater
                    responsibility for planning and reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the
                        <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> determined whether a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-originated project was submitted to the Special
                    Group. In 1963 the Special Group developed general but informal criteria,
                    including risk, possibility of success, potential for exposure, political
                    sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>), for determining whether covert action
                    projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8" xml:id="actionsstatementfn8">Ibid., p. 82.</note>

                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> and General Taylor (as
                    Chairman), exercised responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a major covert
                    action program aimed at overthrowing the Castro regime in Cuba. When President
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> authorized the program in
                    November, he designated Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale, Assistant for
                    Special Operations to the Secretary of Defense, to act as chief of operations,
                    and Lansdale coordinated the Mongoose activities among the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Departments of State and Defense.
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> units in Washington and Miami had
                    primary responsibility for implementing Mongoose operations, which included
                    military, sabotage, and political propaganda programs.<note n="9" xml:id="actionsstatementfn9">See <ref target="frus1961-63v10#d270">

                    Final Report of the Church Committee, however, estimated that of the several

                    1961, only 14 percent were considered on a case-by-case basis by the 303
                    Committee and its predecessors (and successors). Those not reviewed by the 303
                    Committee were low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a
                    February 1967 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum that included a
                    description of the mode of policy arbitration of decisions on covert actions

                            for the security of Southeast Asia can be of decisive importance in the
                            dangerous situation between Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United States has from the start wanted Indonesia to
                            become a free and prosperous nation, able to handle its own destinies
                            without outside interference, and on good terms with its neighbors and
                            the free world. We participated actively in helping Indonesia to gain
                            its independence. We helped Indonesia reach an honorable settlement of
                            the West Irian dispute. For many years we have provided a variety of
                            forms of assistance to Indonesia, all designed to help the Indonesians
                            reach their objectives as a free people controlling their <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0042"/>own destiny. I believe that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the
                            Indonesian people understand our good will toward them.</p>
                        <p>Yet I have been greatly concerned about the already serious tension
                            between Indonesia and Malaysia, which now seems to be entering a new and
                            more dangerous phase. In recent months the Indonesian Government has
                            seemed to be embarked on a course which can only lead to a major,
                            perhaps catastrophic, disruption of Southeast Asia. Indonesia has made
                            no secret of the fact that it is training guerrillas to be introduced
                            into Malaysian territory. Indonesia's most recent acceleration of
                            military confrontation, as exemplified by the major guerrilla raid on
                            Kalabakan and a new resurgence of verbal violence against both Malaysian
                            Borneo and the Government of Malaysia, has reached a point at which open
                            violence, with irretrievable consequences, seems possible. This mounting
                            danger has resulted in extremely powerful resistance to continued United
                            States support for Indonesia on the part of the American Congress and
                            public. I very much doubt that, if Indonesia continues on its present
                            course, we will have legislative freedom to do anything significant in
                            helping the Indonesians develop the full potential of their great
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that your forthcoming meeting will take place at a moment
                            of crisis in Southeast Asia. From our talk in Washington,<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">See <ref target="frus1961-63v23#d392">

                            of the importance of what happens in the next weeks. I remember well
                            that your initiative turned the course of events away from disaster in
                            similar circumstances last summer. The Manila meetings developed an
                            Asian solution through the Maphilindo concept. I believe that what is
                            needed now is another imaginative plan designed to halt all military
                            confrontation immediately, and to lead the Maphilindo powers toward a
                            new attempt at reconciliation through negotiation. In this task, which I
                            know you plan to undertake, I wish to assure you of my fullest support
                            and gratitude.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will avoid
                            open warfare, he continues his policy of “confrontation” aimed at
                            “crushing” Malaysia and makes no secret of his intention to support a
                            guerrilla insurrection in North Borneo.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the Indonesians continue to explore with the Thais and
                            the Filipinos the possibilities of negotiations to end the dispute,
                            including a meeting planned for early January between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Up to the period of full “confrontation”, the United States maintained a
                            minimal aid program in Indonesia designed, first, to strengthen
                            anti-Communist elements for the battle that will follow <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s departure, and, second,
                            to give us a foot-in-the-door influence on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies and for such
                            benefits as the recent oil agreements.</p>
                        <p>With the advent of full “confrontation”, however, we have strongly
                            opposed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies—by
                            warning the Indonesians that a direct attack on Malaysia would bring

                        <p>Our recommendation is against completely cutting off aid at this time.
                            Doing so would not, in our judgment, change <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s behavior, but would wreck
                            the Thai and Filipino efforts at reconciliation. It would also trigger a
                            violent reaction. In all probability, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would seize the $500 million American oil
                            properties, encourage Communist hoodlums to burn our Embassy, and break
                            diplomatic relations—all of which could well be followed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action involving the United States or
                            even our obligations under the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            treaty. These violent actions may eventually come in any case, since we
                            continue to oppose <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            “confrontation” policies. But we should see that it is <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that gets the full
                            onus.</p>
                        <p>What we do recommend is a policy of very tight control over all aspects
                            of both aid and trade with Indonesia, with progressive cuts in our aid
                            programs as the situation and Indonesian behavior warrant.</p>
                        <p>The primary disadvantage of this policy is the risk of domestic criticism
                            of continuing aid and friendly relations with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at this time. In addition,
                            any aid to Indonesia will produce continuing resentment from the United
                            Kingdom and from Malaysia, and continuing pressure on us by them. It is
                            also possible, though not probable, that even the very limited aid we
                            propose may lead some Indonesians to believe that we are not firm in our
                            opposition to their policy of confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The advantages, in ascending order of importance, are that we (1)
                            preserve our foreign business investments in Indonesia, (2) continue
                            strengthening anti-Communist elements within Indonesia as long as
                            possible, (3) maintain for the time being US presence and foot-in-the-
                            door influence, which exercises at least some restraint on the
                            Indonesians and puts us in a position to take advantage of any
                            opportunities for steering their policies into more constructive
                            channels, and (4) avoid <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0045"/>the onus of
                            triggering a break and putting the responsibility for any violent action
                            directly on the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>Under this policy, we would for the time being:</p>
                        <p>1. permit 40,000 tons of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice,
                            which you recently approved, plus small Title II and III programs, to

                            program;</p>
                        <p>4. delay decision on other aid, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480,
                            and related matters as long as possible, making decisions in the light

                            relates only to new obligations. With respect to assistance now in the

                            prior years), we propose the following actions.</p>
                        <p>In the case of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, we have already
                            suspended deliveries of aircraft, ships, and all weapons and ammunition.
                            Up to now, however, we have continued deliveries of other items such as,
                            trucks, electronics equipment, and various spare parts and consumable
                            items (uniforms, tires, etc.) for the Indonesian armed forces, less one
                            major long-standing project for communications in Java and Sumatra only
                            (i.e., possibly not contributing to Indonesian capabilities against
                            Malaysia in the foreseeable future). Preliminary analysis is that about
                            7.5 million dollars of such items remain for delivery at the present
                            time, of which only a small fraction of the items directly used by the
                            armed forces would be likely to be delivered in the near future.
                            Weighing the impact of cut-off on Indonesia versus the consequences of
                            delivering items that do in some degree contribute significantly to
                            Indonesian military capability, the Secretary of Defense, in
                            consultation with the Secretary of State, will examine the list in
                            detail and suspend deliveries that could in any way so contribute. The
                            Secretary of Defense will then report to you the action taken, noting
                            any items that may in his judgment be deliverable under this
                            criteria.</p>

                            of Defense, will examine continually the desirability of continuing
                            deliveries of equipment to the Mobile Brigade in the light of its
                            geographic dispositions, leadership and other considerations and will
                            suspend other deliveries they judge likely to contribute substantially
                            to Indonesian military capability. Approximately $5 million in equipment
                            for the Mobile Brigade is in the pipeline; of this, approximately $2.5
                            million in arms and ammunition already has been suspended. Other
                            elements of the economic assistance pipeline, deliverable over the next
                            two years, consisting of approximately $10 million for technical
                            assistance, $5 million for industrial supplies and equipment, and $7
                            million outstanding on capital project loans, will be discharged in

                            provisional assistance to Indonesia is essential to the national
                            interest of the United States. I have directed that the furnishing of
                            such assistance shall be only for such selective purposes and in such
                            amounts as I may personally from time to time authorize.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the provisions of Section 620(j), the Foreign
                            Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee of the Senate and
                            the Speaker of the House of Representatives will be kept fully and
                            currently informed of any assistance furnished to Indonesia under the
                            Foreign Assistance Act.</p>

                        <p>I have reviewed a memorandum from the Secretary of State to the
                                President<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">
                                <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> which will, presumably,
                            be discussed at this meeting. I offer the following comments to you for
                            what they are worth.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the principal recommendation in this memorandum would
                            constitute an abandonment by the Secretary of State and the President of
                            the opportunity to make the critical judgment on whether the United
                            States should embark upon a policy which involves an eventual risk of
                            U.S. involvement in military operations against Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The last two sentences of the second full paragraph on Page 5 of the
                            Secretary of State's memorandum read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Weighing the impact of cut-off on Indonesia versus the consequences of
                            delivering items that do in some degree contribute significantly to
                            Indonesian military capability, the Secretary of Defense, in
                            consultation with the Secretary of State, will examine the list in
                            detail and suspend deliveries that could in any way so contribute. The
                            Secretary of Defense will then report to you the action taken, noting
                            any items that may in his judgment be deliverable under this
                            criteria.”</p>
                        <p>What is contemplated is that the Secretary of Defense will review all
                            items currently scheduled for delivery to Indonesia with a view to
                            suspending such shipments as may contribute to Indonesian military
                            capability. The Secretary of Defense will “consult” with State and
                            report after the fact to the President. This looks innocent enough on
                            the surface, but it overlooks the basic political fact that a seemingly
                            innocuous decision to suspend a scheduled delivery of a particular item
                            may well be construed by the Indonesians at some point to be a signal of
                            a basic change in U.S. policy toward that country. Consider, for
                            example, the shipment of trucks to the Indonesian army for civil action
                            projects. I understand that the Secretary of Defense is inclined to view
                            some of these shipments as a contribution to Indonesian military
                            capability. This of course may be so; but to the extent that such
                            shipments have been promised to the Indonesians and are subsequently cut
                            off, it seems to me that we may be giving Nasution an unintended
                            indication that the U.S. is abandoning its political support of the
                            Indonesian armed forces. If the Indonesians construed our action in such
                            a way, there would be every incentive to them to take maximum political
                            advantage of such a situation by anticipating further cuts in U.S.
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The example of Cambodia should be kept in mind. When a politically
                            sensitive and popular Asian leader comes to the conclusion, rightly or
                            wrongly, that the United States has become unsympathetic <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0050"/>to his national aims and ambitions, his
                            first reaction will be to prove his independence of U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Indonesia, this could mean that the army and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would unite even more closely behind
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his efforts
                            to “crush” Malaysia. He could be expected to escalate his efforts,
                            appealing to his people for a total national effort against the forces
                            of colonialism led by the United States and its principal European ally.
                            At some point in this process our obligations under the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> Treaty would be called into play;
                            and in any event, we would find it hard domestically to sit idly by
                            while the British got themselves heavily engaged in a guerrilla battle
                            against a vituperative <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Of course, all this may happen in any event; but it seems imperative to
                            me that a decision to risk such a chain of events should be taken at the
                            highest level of the Government and only after full investigation of the
                            possible consequences.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that the Secretaries of State and Defense be assigned
                            the task of reviewing the “pipe line” items, presenting their
                            recommendations to the President (separately if they cannot agree)
                            before any action is taken. In the meantime, I think we must mount a
                            renewed and more intense diplomatic effort to turn <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> off, using whatever
                            leverage that remains to us in our present aid programs in Indonesia.
                            For this purpose I certainly think it is essential that a personal,
                            tough-talking representative of the President visit <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> before the Ramadan month of
                            fasting begins in late January.</p>

                        <p>We face two questions—one broad and one narrow:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Broadly</hi>, it is agreed that we should have a
                            cool and firm policy of increasing opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, if he goes on lifting the
                            level of force used against Malaysia. This policy has already led to a
                            reduction of 80% in our planned assistance to Indonesia for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964. Further reductions should be made
                            in this assistance, in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, and in
                            Pipeline deliveries if Sukarno does not cool off. All this has been made
                            very plain to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and is
                            agreed throughout the Executive Branch.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Narrowly</hi>, we have a question whether all
                            assistance to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> except
                            goods in Pipeline and some <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 should
                            now be cut off because of certain amendments to the Foreign Aid Act.
                            Pros and cons are:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">For</hi> the cut-off:</p>
                        <p>(1) Nobody likes <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and
                            with good reason.</p>
                        <p>(2) Congress has expressed itself strongly.</p>
                        <p>(3) A cut-off might show Sukarno consequences of “confrontation” with
                            Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>(4) Cut-off protects the President from having to determine that
                            assistance to Indonesia is “essential to the interest of the United
                            States.”</p>
                        <p>(5) Adverse consequences in Indonesia could be mitigated by “wind-up”
                            assistance, by continued <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, and by
                            continuing parts of Pipeline deliveries (all outside the reach of the
                            amendment).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Against the cut-off:</p>
                        <p>(1) The programs we have planned are there now because we think them
                            “essential to our national interest.” They are there not because we like
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, but because we
                            are contending for the long-range future of a country of 100 million
                            with great resources in a strategic location. The odds may be long, but
                            the stakes are high, and our investment is small. A cut-off now could
                            end our hopes by our own act. “Wind-up” assistance, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, and Pipeline deliveries would
                            probably not reverse the political effects of the cut-off in
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>(2) The right way to cut or increase these programs is by continuous
                            Presidential judgment in a swiftly moving diplomatic situation. <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0052"/>The President can control all the
                            programs all the time. To let the amendment take effect now would be to
                            cut out one part of the program at a quite arbitrary moment.</p>
                        <p>(3) Such a cut-off today could trigger a violent reaction from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and block efforts to settle
                            dispute by Filipinos and Thais. It could also cost us half a billion of
                            private investment. It could hand Indonesia's future to Communists.
                            Aswan Dam case should remind us that neutrals are ready to seize on our
                            acts to justify their outrages—and to some extent they get away with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Presidential Determination can be reasonably explained to the
                            American people. A draft statement is attached at Tab A.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">Tab A was not attached. (Ibid., National Security

                        <p>1. For new aid obligations, Section 620(j) of the Foreign Assistance Act
                            of 1963<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">See <ref target="#d4fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 4</ref>.</note> provides: “No assistance under this Act
                            shall be furnished to Indonesia <hi rend="italic">unless the President
                                determines that the furnishing of such assistance is essential to
                                the national interest of the United States</hi>.”</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regards Malaysia as
                            neo-colonialist and a threat to his security. He advocates “crushing”
                            Malaysia and supports guerrilla activity in North Borneo. At the same
                            time he continues to explore with the Thais and the Filipinos
                            possibilities for ending the Malaysia dispute. The situation, while
                            dangerous, is not hopeless.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe an aid cutoff would (1) risk a break of diplomatic
                            relations by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            possible violent actions against U.S. personnel and interests; (2)
                            endanger our foreign business investments there, including $500 million
                            American oil properties; and (3) deprive the West of the crucial
                            moderating influence which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> has been able to exercise on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. The Presidential determination we suggest would make possible a $15
                            million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Program for Technical Assistance, Civic Action, malaria
                            eradication, training, and engineering and communications equipment. In
                            the pipeline, not affected by your determination, are $29.5 million

                        <p>5. I will advise you when aid should be stopped, under the terms of
                            Section 620(i), because Indonesia is “engaged in or preparing for
                            aggressive military efforts.”</p>

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> gave a briefing
                            on current developments in Southeast Asia, with special attention to the
                            situation in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the
                            discussion as to whether the President should determine that U.S.
                            economic and military assistance to Indonesia is in the U.S. national
                            interest. In an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, Congress
                            required the President to make such a determination (see attached State
                            Department paper).<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Apparent reference to <ref target="#d7">Document 7</ref>.</note>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said it was not a
                            good time for the President to sign a determination because of the
                            situation existing in the area, i.e., <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> actively seeking to “confront” Malaysia by
                            training and using guerrilla forces on islands now controlled by
                            Malaysia. However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            continued, the President cannot delay indefinitely taking the action
                            required by the Congressional amendment. The Foreign Assistance Act was
                            signed December 18 and Congress will expect Presidential action on the
                            determination shortly. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is coming up to the watershed where he will have
                            to decide either</p>
                        <p>(a) to pull back from his “confrontation.” We have no confidence that he
                            will do so, but it would be possible for him to retreat via a decision
                            to carry on his confrontation policy in an Asian context, i.e., not
                            frontal opposition to the British as sponsors of Malaysia, or;</p>
                        <p>(b) to go ahead with his present policy. If he chooses the latter course,
                            he might resort to open aggression against Malaysia. In such an event,
                            our obligations under the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">Anzus</gloss> Pact
                            would be involved.</p>
                        <p>If we oppose <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> by
                            cutting off all U.S. aid, he might react by confiscating extensive U.S.
                            investments in Indonesia. In the case of a showdown, he might ask help
                            from China and even Russia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said Philippine
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will be
                            talking to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Manila
                            this week. If he so chooses, he might be able to persuade <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to hold back. Therefore, we
                            should take no action today or this week which could have the effect of
                            pushing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0055"/>into all-out aggression against
                            Indonesia. If the law requires action, a temporary determination should
                            be signed. Timing is an important part of the problem. We want to keep
                            the U.S. in a position to influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, but we must keep our good relations with
                            Congress and not allow Congressmen to think we are disregarding the
                            legal requirement they imposed upon us when the Foreign Assistance Act
                            was amended. A determination restricting the scope of the assistance and
                            limited in time would be one way to deal with the present situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said a decision would be required within a few
                            days. After citing the law, which was signed December 18, he said a
                            determination must be made in a reasonable time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                            that the President sign the determination today and instruct all
                            agencies to monitor closely the assistance now in the pipeline which
                            would continue to be sent to Indonesia. He said he understood it was
                            agreed that we would hold up aid amounting to approximately $140
                            million. In the pipeline, there is $50 million of aid, plus an
                            additional $25 million which is to be put into the pipeline. We should
                            try to hold down this $70 million of assistance but we should avoid the
                            consequences to us of action terminating all aid immediately.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's request for his views, Speaker McCormack
                            said he had no confidence in Sihanouk. [<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>?] He recalled an address which Sihanouk made
                            several years ago to a Joint Session of Congress as being the most
                            supercilious speech ever made by a foreigner to the Congress. We must
                            have supreme regard for our friends, i.e., the British, who have primary
                            responsibility in the Malaysian situation. He admitted that the decision
                            was a very close one, but he could not disagree with the reasoning
                            contained in the State Department paper.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said no one in
                            Washington disagreed with the Speaker's description of the unsavory
                            character of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> who is
                            the least responsible leader of any modern State. He said allied
                            solidarity in this situation is very important. He noted that neither
                            the British nor the Australians are ready to break relations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Australia is
                            continuing its aid to Indonesia in an effort to influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to give up his
                            confrontation with Malaysia. Our allies are agreed that the time has not
                            yet come to break with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and conclude the situation is hopeless.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's request, the Attorney General said that as
                            long as the Indonesians are carrying on an active guerrilla campaign
                            against Malaysia, any announcement that the U.S. was continuing aid to
                            Indonesia would be a big boost to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. It would be interpreted as action in support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> despite <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s present unacceptable
                            behavior. If we must act, we should do so in such a way as to make clear
                            that our action is not a vote of confidence in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0056"/>The effect in the U.S. of continuing aid to Indonesia
                            without a change in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            policy would result in confusing domestic opinion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> has already told
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that the U.S.
                            will provide no more aid unless the Indonesians turn away from the
                            policy of confrontation. <persName>Jones</persName> has also said that
                            if Indonesia is blamed as an aggressor, our obligations under the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">Anzus</gloss> Treaty will come into play. He said
                            he agreed with the Attorney General on the U.S. domestic reaction if we
                            continue to give aid to Indonesia. However, it would be bad to act now
                            before the situation is ripe. The stakes are very high. More is involved
                            in Indonesia, with its 100 million people, than is at stake in Viet Nam.
                            We will know much more about the situation and be in a better position
                            to decide what to do in two weeks.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether it was absolutely necessary for the
                            President to make a determination now.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said it was so far
                            as approving any new obligations. A determination cannot be put off much
                            longer even if the assistance we continue to give involves no new
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General asked whether we could continue as we were now doing
                            for two more weeks.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said that we could
                            with some difficulty. He suggested that the determination be phrased in
                            such a way as to permit the continuance of aid for a limited period of
                            time. At the end of that period, a new determination could be made or
                            aid could be halted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said that
                            Congress would be asking very soon what the President was going to do
                            about aid to Indonesia. In addition, there would be press inquiries. At
                            stake were the Administration's relations with Congress. In response to
                            the President's question, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said he would
                            recommend signing the determination but sending to Djakarta a tough man
                            who would tell <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that
                            the President did not intend to continue assistance unless <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> halted the confrontation
                            effort. He suggested the Attorney General as a Presidential emissary
                            noting that the Attorney General had a reservoir of good will which was
                            built up during a visit to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General demurred and said he did not look forward to a trip
                            to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> noted that in his
                            view cessation of U.S. aid would not induce <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to give up his effort to
                            destroy Malaysia. He thought that a cutoff of aid would have very
                            serious consequences for us, but would not alter <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s opposition to Malaysia.
                            Possibly there may be a solution in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> in Manila. We should not write off the
                            possibility of something coming out of Manila by making a decision now,
                            even though further delay will probably cause criticism in the U.S. He
                            recalled that in his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0057"/>recently, he urged the Philippine
                            President to meet with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He agreed that a Presidential emissary should
                            be sent to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> but this
                            should be done in such a way as not to impair the relationship which
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> now has with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He recommended
                            that if action is necessary, a determination for a limited period of
                            time should be signed.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> recommended that a limited determination be
                            signed, i.e., limited in scope. He believed that if a determination
                            limited as to time were signed, then every thirty days we would have to
                            go through the exercise all over again. He believed we should get the
                            decision behind us now to avoid the issue coming up in Congress every
                            time a fixed period ended. He predicted that some months would pass
                            before we know exactly where we are in Indonesia. He favored continuing
                            a limited program for keeping a foot in the door. If the Indonesians
                            turn against us and seize U.S. investments, the Chinese Communists might
                            get the U.S. oil companies, thereby altering the strategic balance in
                            the area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said the question
                            was whether we decide to stay at the table and play a little longer
                            rather than leave the table now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> noted that if
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> steps up his
                            guerrilla warfare against Malaysia, we can charge him in the UN with
                            aggression. Other political pressures are available to us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the
                            picture was indeed dark, but the U.S. should not force the issue now
                            because this is the wrong time to act. We should continue the smallest
                            amount of aid possible. This aid would serve as a protection to the U.S.
                            investments in Indonesia. The determination should not be friendly and
                            should make clear that our assistance was being continued for the time
                            being, but not for a fixed period.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that if a
                            determination were signed, this would not mean that at a later time we
                            could not cut off aid if, for example, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was charged by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with aggression.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sorensen asked whether the U.S. was giving aid to Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> replied that no U.S.
                            aid was now being given to Malaysia. The British are giving assistance.
                            We decided that we did not have to start a program in Malaysia which,
                            for an underdeveloped country, is comparatively well off.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName>, as acting
                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, favored the State-proposed
                            program. He believed the U.S. should keep its foot in the door. He
                            recommended that a decision be held off until after the Manila
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            whether a decision had to be made now. He suggested that we could
                            describe the current situation <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0058"/>to
                            the Congressional leaders, telling them that no new aid was being
                            provided, that aid in the pipeline would continue, and that the
                            determination that this aid was in the national interest would be a
                            temporary determination. We should inform <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> of our position and following
                            the Manila meeting, and in the light of circumstances then existing, we
                            could decide what to do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed that it would
                            be useful for us to take a reading following the Manila meeting. He said
                            the problem had been brought to the President because the Department was
                            aware of Congressional pressure on the President to make a decision. He
                            agreed that we could inform the appropriate Congressional committees
                            that we are holding off making a decision.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should talk to the appropriate Congressional
                            committees, explaining our hope that a solution to the immediate problem
                            caused by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            confrontation policy would be found. We should consider sending a
                            Presidential emissary to talk to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and we should tell the British and the
                            Australians what we are doing. As soon as we are able to take a new
                            reading, and if the Congressional committees' reaction is satisfactory,
                            we would be in a position to decide. Both the Secretary of State and the
                            Secretary of Defense should talk to the Congressional committees in an
                            effort to find out what they think. He said it would be a mistake to
                            decide to cut off aid before we knew the outcome of the Manila
                            conference. But, on the other hand, it was very difficult to say that
                            aid to Indonesia under present circumstances is in the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought we
                            could avoid a determination for some weeks. He suggested that the
                            Attorney General ask one of his lawyers to decide whether a Presidential
                            determination is required now. If there is a difference among the
                            lawyers, as appears to be the case, the Attorney General could decide
                            which lawyer had the best case.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Attorney General to take on this task. He said he
                            did not want to be in the position of acting with lack of faith toward
                                Congress.<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">The decisions taken at this

                        </p>
                        <p>We have carefully reviewed the points made in your letter regarding
                            Western economic aid and credits to Indonesia. It seems to me that we
                            are in full agreement concerning the aid programs of our respective
                            countries and are, in fact, following parallel courses. As you know, our
                            economic aid to Indonesia is currently confined to on-going programs of
                            technical assistance, training, etc., and to shipments of surplus
                            agricultural commodities under our existing three-year Public Law 480
                            agreement with Indonesia. We are also continuing a modest program of
                            military aid, although we have stopped all shipments of arms and
                            ammunition and intend to concentrate the program almost entirely on
                            training and on support for the Indonesian civic action program. We have
                            no plans to expand any of our aid programs unless there is a significant
                            change in Indonesia's confrontation policy against Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>We, too, have been watching with interest the current Indonesian search
                            for aid, credits and new entrepot facilities to help them overcome the
                            effect of confrontation on their already shaky economy. As far as we can
                            determine, their search has not been successful to date in attracting
                            resources sufficient to have an appreciable impact in easing their
                            economic problems. I understand that they have found a few sources of
                            credit, and are working on various arrangements to by-pass Singapore
                            with their foreign trade. No major foreign aid from Western Europe or
                            Japan seems to be in prospect at present, however.</p>
                        <p>I agree fully that it is essential to disabuse <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of any thought that the
                            West will inevitably bail him out of his difficulties no matter how
                            intolerable his actions. Certainly this is no time to consider, or to

                            to consider, actions in the economic field which would tend to give him
                            that impression. At the same time, I must admit to a lack of optimism
                            that the pressures of economic deterioration, however severe they may
                            become, will necessarily force Sukarno to moderate his policies. Based
                            on his past performance, such pressures might instead goad him into even
                            greater irrationality unless carefully applied.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean to imply that we should refrain from adding economic
                            pressures and inducements to the other tools we are using in our efforts
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. We are
                            employing these tools, of course, and will continue to do so. In this
                            connection, you probably know that we recently responded to urgent
                            Indonesian requests for additional surplus rice by offering to provide
                            them with the amount (roughly 40,000 tons) to which they were already
                            entitled under our existing agreement with them. This move has had the
                            effect of completing all rice deliveries to which we are committed under
                            the agreement. We took advantage of the occasion to make entirely clear
                            to the Indonesians that the supply of any further surplus rice next year
                            will be contingent upon an easing of their policy of confrontation
                            regarding Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>While I believe we should use economic pressures and inducements
                            actively, I would hesitate to suggest that they be applied to the point
                            of isolating Indonesia economically from the West. To the contrary, it
                            seems to me that Indonesia's mounting difficulties offer us an
                            opportunity to obtain the long term advantages of an expanded Western
                            equity in the Indonesian economy without either significantly
                            strengthening Indonesia's ability to withstand the effects of
                            confrontation or encouraging <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to believe that the West is willing to bail him
                            out. For this reason, I would not object to modest moves by Japan and by
                            Germany, the Netherlands, France and other Western nations to expand
                            their economic and commercial relations with Indonesia. As long as those
                            activities remain within the limits now foreseen—short and medium term
                            credits, commercial arrangements for the marketing of Indonesia's
                            exports, and an increase in private investment in Indonesia—I feel that
                            we should interpret them as essentially beneficial to our mutual
                            interests. They provide an alternative to an all-out turn to the Bloc
                            for aid, a constant reminder to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of his country's continuing economic reliance on
                            the West, and a certain restraint on his actions. Over the longer term,
                            particularly in the post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era, the lodgments gained in the Indonesian
                            economy could well become an important factor in reorienting the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>As we see the problems raised by Indonesia's confrontation policy, they
                            fall into two essentially different spheres. On the one hand there is
                            the aggressive and dangerous paramilitary activity in Borneo, the
                            subversion in West Malaysia, the virulent propaganda campaign, the <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0061"/>break in transportation and
                            communications with Malaysia, and the cessation of bilateral trade
                            between them. This aspect of confrontation is the one we are trying to
                            modify and eventually to eliminate. On the other hand, there is the
                            Indonesian effort to divert its trade from Singapore and eliminate the
                            country's economic dependence on the Singapore entrepot. Even if we
                            succeed in ending the political-military confrontation, I doubt that the
                            Indonesian drive to by-pass the Singapore entrepot will ever be
                            reversed. Rather than attempting fruitlessly to force a reversal, our
                            best course may be simply to recognize it as a fact of life and take
                            what steps we can to insure that the new trade relationships the
                            Indonesians will inevitably establish are those best calculated to serve
                            the interests of the West.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that the foregoing is incompatible in any major sense
                            with the views expressed in your letter. The difference, if any, would
                            seem to be one of emphasis. You can be sure that we do not intend to use
                            our resources, or encourage the use of our friends' resources, in such a
                            way as to aid or abet <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            in his policy of confrontation.</p>
                        <p>I might conclude by saying that I fully understand the anxieties which
                            are felt by your Government and among your people about trade and aid to
                            a country which seems to be creating a dangerous situation in your part
                            of the world. We ourselves are taking casualties every week in South
                            Viet-Nam and we are quite clear that Peiping and Hanoi are the moving
                            forces behind aggression against that country. Just before Christmas,
                            for example, seven tons of Chinese-made arms and ammunition were
                            captured in a Viet Cong depot in the delta. We have here, therefore,
                            both in the Congress and among the public, real sensitivity about trade
                            and aid as they affect Peiping and Hanoi in the absence of a peaceful
                            policy by those two capitals.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards,</p>

                            <persName>Johnson</persName> [hereafter LBJ]: <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doesn't act to me like he
                            goes much with these State Department policies. He is the only one that
                            stayed with me on Indonesia. Now we got it down from 35 million to 15
                            million, and I refused to go under 15 million, and they say, well, I'm
                            going to pull out and break away, and cause us not to have any relations
                            at all, and we can't move away from the table if we expect to bid on the
                            pot, and so now I have turned it all down though, and concluded that
                            Bobby Kennedy would have to give us a legal opinion on whether this
                            stuff is in the pipeline.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Russell</persName> [hereafter RR]: Let that
                            thing cool for a while. The Russians can't get in there to help
                            them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">LBJ</persName>: Whether this money in the
                            pipeline constituted a violation of the act of Congress, I don't think
                            it does. You see this damn Republican put a prohibition in there unless
                            I made a finding it was in the national interest. So they want me to
                            make a finding, and I put it off on the theory that I haven't made any
                            new allocations. And that all that is going to them [the Indonesians]
                            was in the pipeline. And I couldn't stop that without going out there
                            and sinking the ships. And now I am going to send Bobby Kennedy to
                            Indonesia and just let them put it right in his lap.</p>

                            took it [West New Guinea] away from the Dutch and gave it to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, didn't he?</p>

                            the Indonesia thing,<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">At 4:50 p.m. on January
                                9, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and the
                                President discussed the “Indonesia thing.”
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> informed the President that he did
                                not believe the situation was as urgent as originally thought and
                                suggested that they should not “make a major step until we know
                                exactly what <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had done.”
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> informed the President that John
                                Richardson would visit <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>. <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested
                                delaying the matter for two or three weeks. The President was not
                                convinced and insisted that <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert
                                    Kennedy</persName> see <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as soon as possible.
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> demurred and suggested that he would
                                try to “get it cranking.” (Ibid.)</note> or have you already called
                            him?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGB</persName>: I've talked to him, Mr.
                            President, and told him you wanted him to go, but before he goes, Mr.
                            President, he has got to talk to you. We're generating various bits of
                            paper and instructions. I think there ought to be a meeting
                                tomorrow<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">No record of such a meeting has

                            it'll be grand if you would, but I think we can do half of it before you
                            join us, and I think we can probably get it into final paper where Bobby
                            could come and call on you before he goes, which I think is the right
                            way to do it. I just hung up from talking to him, I was talking to him
                            when you called.</p>

                            your proposal is that the Attorney General whom he knows come out and do

                            tomorrow, and then we'll let you know where we are after that, if that's

                        <p>Further analysis of the problems involved in your making the
                            determination required under the Broomfield Amendment to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act of 1961<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">Section 620(j) of the
                                Foreign Assistance Act of 1963, see <ref target="#d4fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 4</ref>.</note> suggests that you have two major
                            alternative courses of action:</p>
                        <p>1. You can make a determination now which legally would stand for an
                            indefinite period until you decided formally or informally to review it.
                            Such a determination would explain that you were keeping in close and
                            personal touch with the assistance programs and were instructing all
                            agencies of government to keep you fully informed. The advantage of this
                            procedure is that it relieves you once and for all of the necessity of
                            having to make another formal determination at a later date (i.e., after
                            the Attorney General's return) when the political impact might be
                            greater. It would also have the advantage of being blanketed by your
                            separate announcement of the Attorney General's trip and the Manila
                            communique. It also somewhat improves the Attorney General's bargaining
                            position, since otherwise <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may well take the position that we are using the
                            determination as a lever, which of course is “unacceptable” to proud
                            neutralists.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantage of this course would be that you are making this
                            decision before the Indonesians have given any concrete evidence that
                            they are prepared to dampen down their military confrontation in North
                            Borneo.</p>
                        <p>2. You can decide to defer this whole matter until some time after the
                            Attorney General returns, perhaps for as long as two months from now.
                            You could continue existing programs under an opinion which you have
                            received from the Attorney General to the effect that you have a
                            “reasonable” time in which to review the situation in light of <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0066"/>the new Congressional policy.
                            Aside from giving you more time to consider the issues, the advantage of
                            this procedure would be to show that you have taken the Congressional
                            mandate so seriously that you have dispatched a special emissary of
                            Cabinet rank for discussions with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and that you are deferring your final decision
                            until his return. The disadvantage is that the making of such a
                            determination at that time will attract greater political attention,
                            since it will reflect an informed decision reached by you after two
                            months' review of the facts and a report from the Attorney General on
                            his mission. It would not be possible to argue that a quick
                            determination was required in order to continue the reduced assistance
                            programs that are now in progress. This second course is also somewhat
                            more open to political attack as an evasion of the legal requirements of
                            the amendment.</p>
                        <p>The possibilities of a temporary determination at this time, or a flat
                            determination to continue assistance without explanation have been
                            rejected as having most of the disadvantages and few of the advantages
                            of the two courses set forth above. The majority of your principal
                            officers seem now to favor course No. 1. A draft memorandum from you to
                            the Secretary of State making such a determination is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">There is no indication on the memorandum which
                                course of action the President decided upon, but the attached

                        </p>
                        <p>The President has instructed the Attorney General to meet <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Tokyo. The purpose of
                            the trip is two-fold. The first purpose is to make completely clear the
                            consequences for United States-Indonesian relationships<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">A copy of this memorandum was sent to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. At this point <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added the following
                                handwritten note: “What consequences should he [illegible—hit?]
                                to—inevitably Aus[tralian?] forces and we will have a serious prob
                                under <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> treaty; <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will be drawn in [,] aid must stop—we
                                would be forced to support anti-Indo forces [illegible—North?]”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also put the
                                following comment at the top of the memorandum: “lack bite[,] stick
                                and carrot.” (Washington National Records Center, RG 330, OSD Files:
                                FRC 69 A 7425, Indonesia)</note> if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> continues his present policies toward Malaysia.
                            The second is to further the over-all United States objective of getting
                            the Indonesians, Malaysians and Filipinos to sit down together for talks
                            looking toward an “Asian solution” of the dispute. Depending on the
                            progress made with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            the Attorney General may be asked to continue on to Manila, Kuala Lumpur
                            and London—the latter being particularly important if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is at all forthcoming.</p>
                        <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0068"/>
                        <p>There are a number of ways in which a satisfactory solution might come
                            about, and it is unnecessary—perhaps even useless—to try at this stage
                            to be precise about how events might move toward such a solution.
                            However, for purposes of illustration, it might be helpful to set down
                            the following as one way in which a satisfactory solution might
                            eventuate:</p>
                        <p>1. Since it is unreasonable to expect <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to negotiate with a pistol at his head, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> agrees to call off all
                            military “confrontation” entirely. If this cannot be done he agrees to
                            at least a cease-fire during which talks can begin.</p>
                        <p>2. In exchange for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            abandoning military “confrontation”, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> agrees to talks without pre-conditions—i.e. the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> drops his present
                            condition that talks shall constitute recognition of Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>3. The British agree to the above and also to some lessening of their
                            military “presence” on the Borneo border.</p>
                        <p>4. It is highly desirable that the solution coming out of the tripartite
                            talks be one that the participants themselves develop. But one form that
                            this might take but which we should not mention to any of the
                            participants is for the Malaysians to guarantee to do in North Borneo
                            exactly what the Indonesians do in fulfillment of their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> pledge for a “plebiscite” in West New
                            Guinea—but only if there is no subversive or guerrilla warfare in the
                            intervening five years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has refused to accept
                            the existence of Malaysia. Although he had given us assurance he will
                            not engage in open attack, he has mounted guerrilla action and a
                            political and economic campaign to destroy the state or alter its
                            nature. His precise objectives are unclear to us—and probably to him as
                            well,—but they probably are to: 1) as a maximum, detach the Borneo
                            states from Malaysia and establish a more sympathetic regime in Kuala
                            Lumpur; 2) as a minimum, implement a formula that would allow the Borneo
                            states to remain within Malaysia but permit <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to claim a public victory
                            over his opponents and give him an opening for future attempts to assert
                            domination over Malaysia; 3) eliminate British influence in the area;
                            and 4) prevent possible Chinese take-over on Indonesia's borders.</p>
                        <p>Whatever his actual purpose, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s campaign of confrontation has led to an
                            increasingly serious threat to the peace of the region. The British: 1)
                            have assumed responsibility for Malaysia's defense against Indonesia; 2)
                            are suffering losses from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s guerrillas; 3) are being forced to move in
                            more military resources than is convenient; 4) have consistently been
                            trying to get us involved in order to share the burden with them; and 5)
                            are fast losing both patience and objectivity. The Australians, also
                            committed to defend Malaysia, are holding back, as they do not want to
                            come into direct conflict with their large and close neighbor. They hope
                            that some sort of modus vivendi can be worked out with the Indonesians.
                            Under growing British pressure to commit <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0069"/>troops to Borneo, however, they will find it
                            increasingly hard to stay out if the guerrilla attacks continue.</p>
                        <p>The implications for us are two-fold. In terms of our general interests,
                            the outbreak of open hostilities between Britain and Indonesia would
                            have a potentially disastrous effect on the security of the area, on
                            relations between the West and the neutralist Afro-Asians, and on the
                            future orientation of Indonesia. In terms of our specific commitments,
                            hostilities between Australian and Indonesian forces in Borneo would
                            enable the Australians to invoke the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> pact and call upon us for direct intervention against
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Purpose of the Meeting</p>
                        <p>The danger in the situation has primarily arisen from Indonesian military
                            guerrilla action, although mishandling, blunders, inflexibility and
                            cupidity on part of various of the other parties—the British, Malaysians
                            and Filipinos—have contributed substantially. If the dangerous
                            deterioration is to be reversed, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> must be induced to take the first step. That
                            step must be the cessation of military activity against Malaysia. This
                            by itself would leave the dispute far from resolved, but it would create
                            an atmosphere in which further initiative could eventually bring about a
                            tolerable solution.</p>
                        <p>The task of inducing Sukarno to abandon military confrontation will be
                            difficult, since it will require him to give up not only his most potent
                            weapon against Malaysia but also by implication, his maximum objectives
                            toward it. Abandoning military confrontation will also force him to
                            reverse a policy to which he has publicly pledged himself, which will be
                            excruciatingly difficult for one with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s ego. There are, however, factors already
                            pushing him toward an easing of tensions. Indonesia's economy is under
                            severe strain and worse is in sight. The foreign aid on which Indonesia
                            has relied for a decade is drying up, largely because of
                            “confrontation”, and no major injections from either East or West are in
                            the offing. Aside from lukewarm Philippine support and the propaganda
                            backing of the Bloc, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            has attracted no outside support for his campaign and a great deal of
                            international censure. With a few exceptions (confiscation of British
                            property in Indonesia, severance of relations with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>), he has already committed virtually all
                            the weapons at his disposal without bringing down Malaysia, and seems to
                            be at somewhat of a loss as to his next move. Although willing to run
                            very high risks, he knows that the British-Australians are far too
                            strong for him and that he cannot deliberately provoke an open
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>Our basic leverage with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is the fact that, however cavalier he is with
                            American sensibilities, he is demonstrably anxious to retain <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0070"/>United States friendship. He wants and
                            needs our aid; he relishes the prestige of dealing with us as an
                            “equal”; and he certainly senses the manifold disadvantages to Indonesia
                            of a serious breach with the world's most powerful nation. But if given
                            no alternative other than a humiliating public defeat, he would probably
                            be willing to break with us. Our leverage thus is substantial but
                            limited.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The State Department's instructions describe the purpose of the meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and can be
                            summarized briefly as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The main purpose of the trip is to get across as forcefully as
                            possible to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that the
                            policy of military confrontation which he is pursuing against Malaysia
                            will have disastrous consequences for our relations with his country.
                            This is not the case of West New Guinea. The reaction among the American
                            people against Indonesia is already so strong that the possibility of
                            maintaining any of the cooperative programs which we have established
                            over the years is becoming remote. If hostilities should escalate and
                            the Australians become involved, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will find us and the rest of the civilized world
                            necessarily aligned against him.</p>
                        <p>In short, the Attorney General will use every possible argument to
                            persuade <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to abandon
                            his military activities in Borneo completely, or, at least, agree to a
                            cease-fire.</p>

                        <p>2. The second objective of the visit is to bring <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> back to the negotiating table. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> gives reasonable assurance
                            that he will abandon or suspend his military activities, then the
                            Attorney General will proceed to Manila and Kuala Lumpur in an effort to
                            encourage the leaders in these two capitals to meet as quickly as
                            possible. The Attorney General will not himself attempt to negotiate
                            their difficulties; his job is to help clear away obstacles to the three
                            of them getting together and coming up with an Asian solution.</p>
                        <p>3. If the talks have gone well this far, the Attorney General will go on
                            to London. His purpose there is to tell the British the results of his
                            talks in the Far East and to persuade them to support whatever
                            arrangements for an early meeting of the three Asian leaders he has been
                            able to work out.</p>

                        <p>The central purpose of this trip is to convince <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of the inevitable
                            consequences of the policy of military confrontation which he is now
                            following toward Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>This policy will have disastrous consequences for our relations with his
                            country. Malaysia is not West Irian. The reaction here against Indonesia
                            is already so strong that it has become difficult for the President to
                            maintain any of the cooperative programs established over the years.</p>
                        <p>The recent Foreign Aid Act contains two amendments which reflect this
                            American feeling. While the President would like to be able to continue
                            certain assistance programs for Indonesia under this Act, he cannot make
                            the necessary determination that such assistance is in the interest of
                            the United States unless:</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> can give you
                            assurances that there will be a shift away from military confrontation,
                            and at a minimum by agreement to a cease-fire pending negotiation.</p>
                        <p>b. There can be an understanding that the determination will not be
                            followed by further military actions against Malaysia which would make a
                            mockery of the President's decision. </p>
                        <p>A still more serious evidence of American feeling is the Gruening
                            Amendment, under which, if there were aggression or a preparation for
                            aggression, the United States would have to cut off all assistance of
                            every sort. The President hopes that your visit may be able to produce
                            clear understandings that will avoid any need to apply this
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>In the wider sense, a policy of military confrontation with Malaysia
                            seems bound to lead Indonesia toward hostilities with neighboring
                            nations. This will certainly bring the case before the United Nations in
                            circumstances in which Indonesia would<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">At
                                this point <persName>Bundy</persName> replaced the following
                                phrases: “have very little support among members or from the

                                aligned against Indonesia;” to read “be considered the aggressor by
                                the Secretary General and most of the United Nations including the
                                United States.”</note> be considered the aggressor by the Secretary
                            General and most members of the United Nations <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0074"/>including the United States. Both our countries would
                            stand to lose everything we have invested in cooperation, and what began
                            as a confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia could end as a
                            confrontation between Indonesia and the United States.</p>
                        <p>In short, you should use every possible argument to persuade <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to abandon his military
                            activities in Borneo completely, or at least, agree to a

                                <persName>Bundy</persName> indicated that the following two

                                determination that assistance to Indonesia is in the national
                                interest. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                gives no satisfactory response, we shall have an equally clear basis

                        <p>The second object of this visit is to bring <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> back to the negotiating table. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> gives reasonable assurance
                            that he will abandon or suspend his military activities, then you should
                            proceed to Manila and Kuala Lumpur in an effort to encourage the leaders
                            in these two capitals to meet as quickly as possible. You should not
                            yourself attempt to negotiate their difficulties; your job is to help
                            clear away obstacles to getting the three of them together to work out
                            an Asian solution.</p>
                        <p>If the talks have gone well this far, you will go on to London. Your
                            purpose there is to tell the British the results of your talks in the
                            Far East and to persuade them to support whatever arrangements for an
                            early meeting of the three Asian leaders you have been able to work
                            out.</p>

                        <p>2109. President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> agreed
                            to stop military confrontation on Kalimanitan border as preparatory step
                            to holding tripartite meeting of representatives Malaysia, Indonesia,
                            Philippines. This followed hour and a half exchange of views in which
                            Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> pointed
                            out serious dangers involved in escalation military confrontation and US
                            concern that peaceful settlement be reached in this dispute.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Attorney General</persName> informed
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> he would discuss
                            arrangements for tripartite meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> when he visited Kuala Lumpur next week. He told
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> it was
                            unreasonable to expect Malaysians to come to a meeting to settle this
                            dispute so long as military confrontation continued. He agreed to notify
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> through Amb
                                <persName>Jones</persName> on Wednesday, January 22, following his
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s views.</p>
                        <p>For his part <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he
                            would return to Djakarta on Monday<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">January
                                20.</note> and at meeting of motion Tuesday would initiate
                            preparations to call off military confrontation. If reply from <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> favorable, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would issue public
                            statement on Thursday. General <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName>, who was present, said so far as regular Indonesian
                            military was concerned this could be done in matter of hours. But he
                            explained communication with guerrilla units inside Kalamantan was more
                            difficult and might take as long as a week. Attorney General emphasized
                            importance of starting immediately in order to avoid possible incidents
                            and to help him convince <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            Indos were sincere. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            pointed out that British would of course also have to agree to cessation
                            of hostilities. Attorney General concurred but emphasized that Indos
                            were responsible for [garble—situation].</p>
                        <p>In his discussion of mutual withdrawal of troops from border, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> proposed
                            inspection by representatives neutral nation. Attorney General pointed
                            out that actual cessation of hostilities was more important than a
                            supervised withdrawal. Furthermore, word of both leaders was good enough
                            and this was matter which did not require unnecessary complication by
                            formal procedures. Understanding was reached that ministerial level
                            talks would precede summit meeting.</p>

                        <p>Statement by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would be

                            meet in consultation and in order to facilitate such meeting Indonesia
                            would suspend military activities in Kalimantan.</p>

                            extremely friendly even lighthearted. This was followed by business

                        <p>At this point it would seem that Bobby has accomplished one half his
                            mission much more successfully than any of us thought possible. It is
                            quite clear that this form of personal diplomacy is the key to doing
                            business with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. We
                            have known this in theory for some time, but it has to be seen to be
                            really understood.</p>
                        <p>The other half of the job may be much more difficult and will require
                            support from Washington. Although Bobby has briefed the British
                            Ambassador in Tokyo fully both before and after meeting yesterday and
                            has given general briefing to Malaysian and Australian envoys, it seems
                            probable that three major pitfalls still remain.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> may insist on agreement
                            by Indos to recognize Malaysia before any meetings and British may
                            support him in this.</p>
                        <p>2. This morning it was not entirely clear whether <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would insist on announcing
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s agreement to meet
                            publicly at same time he announces stand-down of hostilities in
                            Kalimantan.</p>
                        <p>3. Incidents may flare up on either side during Bobby's swing.</p>
                        <p>Since Bobby is going to Djakarta after Kuala Lumpur, problems 1 and 2 can
                            still be handled in the context of the current talks. But problem 3
                            cannot. Part of difficulty will be Indos lack of complete control over
                            guerrillas inside Sarawak. Part will be natural British desire to mop up
                            during cease fires. Our job will be to try to keep both from allowing
                            unnecessary accidents to occur. In connection with all these problems we
                            might keep in mind the British have at least two plus cards to play. The
                            ships and spare parts in Hong Kong are one card. Another card is
                            approval of Maphilindo. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that British were unalterably opposed to
                            and contemptuous of Maphilindo. It should not cost Brits very much to
                            make statement in support of Maphilindo as an Asian concept at useful
                            time. We should chivvy British into willingness to hold some gesture in
                            reserve in case we need them to help break an Indo-Malaysian impasse. In
                            the meantime they must refrain from making statements or taking actions
                            which could set back progress made to date.</p>
                        <p>President should know that Bobby has done magnificent job not only with
                            Indos but also in keeping British fully informed. One thing Department
                            should consider before asking Bobby make too many stops en route London
                            is need to get Brits on board quickly.</p>

                            seemed to be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Attorney General outlined his plans as follows: will go to Philippines
                            Sunday night, Kuala Lumpur Tuesday morning and then London. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked if he could not come
                            to Djakarta and Attorney General agreed one day visit beginning
                            Wednesday. Attorney General promised to give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> further report through
                            Ambassador Jones following his visit to London. In this connection he
                            said it was most important that everybody understood our position, he
                            pointed out that we have treaty commitments in the area and that our
                            attitudes would necessarily be influenced by whether or not all accepted
                            the proposal for cease-fire followed by tripartite meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said only matter that seemed to remain undecided was
                            the question of being sure that the situation remained under control in
                            the event of an incident. He suggested that all involved should be
                            agreeable to refraining from any retaliation if there were an incident.
                            He also thought that it would be wise to get agreement of an Asian power
                            to send in an observer in the event of an incident. There was some
                            discussion of the possibility of the Thais but final decision was to ask
                            Japanese if they would be prepared to help out in this way.</p>
                        <p>As to timing, Indonesians felt preparations for a meeting should be made
                            as rapidly as possible. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he would meet with <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss> (Supreme Military Advisory Council) Tuesday and would
                            be prepared to announce cessation military confrontation as soon as he
                            was informed by Attorney General that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> was ready to meet with him. It was decided
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might make such
                            announcement on Wednesday during, or at end of, Attorney General's
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>In short discussion of timing of actual implementation of cease-fire,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName> said it would take about
                            one week to get proper control of guerrillas already inside Sarawak and
                            Sabah. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> expressed
                            the <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0079"/>hope that the British and
                            Malaysians would refrain from any “mopping up operations.” Attorney
                            General replied that British/Malaysians could hardly be expected refrain
                            from attempting capture “bandits” and that General <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName> should instruct guerrillas to take
                            care of themselves by withdrawing into jungle. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that all
                            reconnaissance flights should also stop. The Attorney General agreed
                            flights by both sides should stop.</p>
                        <p>Attorney General said we did not wish to get into technical details
                            arrangement tripartite meeting but were interested how this to be done.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said

                        <p>1071. At 2–1/2 hour breakfast meeting Malacanang this morning Attorney
                            General and President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            agreed on following time table for efforts to get tripartite meetings
                            going.</p>
                        <p>1. From Kuala Lumpur Attorney General would proceed Djakarta where
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would instruct
                            cessation military activities Kalimantan. Hope is that by January 29 all
                            such activities including guerrilla activities would have ceased.
                            Attorney General would proceed to Bangkok to fill in Thanat Khoman and
                            suggest that <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> organize
                            meeting at level of Foreign Minister in Bangkok around February 7.</p>
                        <p>2. Bangkok meeting would begin negotiations for later summit meeting and
                            would provide time during which effectiveness of cessation of military
                            action could be verified.</p>
                        <p>3. Philippines prefer Thais over Japanese both to organize tripartite
                            meeting at ministerial level and to investigate any alleged military
                            incidents which might occur by either side, although President Macapag-
                            al said he would accede to wishes of other parties if they felt
                            strongly.</p>
                        <p>4. Prior to having Attorney General's report on conversations in Tokyo
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> had already
                            made tentative plans visit <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            in Phnom Penh and asked whether in Attorney General's judgment this
                            would be useful. Attorney General replied that only good could come of
                            such meeting provided Philippines had assured themselves that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was informed and agreed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> instructed <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> confirm <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s agreement such meeting.
                            It was left that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            meeting could take place at any time without interfering with tripartite
                            ministerial negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName>
                            said that idea of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            meeting originated with British Ambassador Addis.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> asked whether Attorney
                            General should not also try persuade <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> suspend political as well as military
                            confrontation since polemics before and during period tripartite
                            meetings could be just as dangerous. Attorney General agreed and also
                            suggested that this should be on Bangkok agenda.</p>
                        <p>6. Attorney General briefed Ambassador Addis fully on the above points.
                            Addis seemed most concerned lest British be put into a box on <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0082"/>military withdrawals. Attorney General
                            assured him that no proposals had been made regarding withdrawal of
                            troops. Discussions on Tokyo and Manila concerned cessation of military
                            activities only.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> seemed interested in bringing
                            Sihanouk into Malaysia problem and at one point suggested Cambodians as
                            neutral nation to investigate border incidents. They implied Cambodian
                            involvement could be helpful in resolving misunderstandings between US
                            and Cambodia. We replied that Malaysia problem was separate and far more
                            dangerous to stability in Southeast Asia Cambodian-US relations and
                            suggested that two should not be mixed. <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> said that US-Cambodian impasse over radio
                            broadcast on verge of solution which was especially significant in view
                            of fact that Sihanouk planned to be Kuala Lumpur at same time as
                            Attorney General. Phils obviously interested in starting separate
                            diplomatic “adventure” by engaging Attorney General with Sihanouk during
                            this mission.</p>
                        <p>8. Attorney General urgently requested guidance from Department on
                            tactics in Kuala Lumpur in event Sihanouk should request meeting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> seemed genuinely pleased
                            with results of Tokyo meeting and with frankness and promptness of
                            consultation with him. Participating in the meeting for the Phils were
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RCP1">Romulo</persName> and Cayco.</p>
                        <p>Large part of meeting was devoted to explanation by Phils of their view
                            of problems in Southeast Asia and role which they wished to play. Full

                            the ointment is that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> agreed
                            to meet only at ministerial level with possible Summit later, whereas
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wanted the
                            initial bargain to include a Summit. But Bobby should be able to work
                            this out.</p>
                        <p>To tape things down and forestall each side putting out its own slanted
                            version, Bobby will probably issue a public statement (either in
                            Djakarta, where he is now, or Bangkok his next stop). From Bangkok he
                            heads direct to London, where hopefully the British will be duly
                            grateful, and then home Monday or Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>In short, it looks as though he may have gotten the Malaysia dispute “out
                            of the jungle and onto the conference table.” Subsequent negotiation of
                            a compromise settlement will be tricky, but if the parties come to the
                            table it means they want to make a deal.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> outlined results discussions in
                            Manila and <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss>, stating that procedures
                            discussed in Tokyo were acceptable in both capitals. He said both
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> believed situation was
                            deteriorating in way which involved threat to entire area and that they
                            were interested in peaceful, Asian solution. AG had told <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> that if the tripartite meeting
                            was arranged <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would
                            put out statement ordering cessation hostilities and that organized
                            military activities would take day or so to halt while guerrilla
                            activities would take perhaps seven days (<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> interjected “at least”) to
                            control.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said he had talked about dates and
                            calculated that assuming week required to call off military
                            confrontation, i.e., military activities would cease around end of
                            January, ministerial meeting could take place in Bangkok Feb 5–6. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said the arrangements for this meeting
                            would be up to Thanat Khoman who it was understood was acceptable to all
                            three parties to dispute. AG would go to Bangkok to fill him [in]
                            personally over dinner Thursday night, Jan 24; after that go to
                            London.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> discussed designation of
                            observer-investigator mentioning that there was some reluctance on part
                            both Phils and Malaysians to accept Japanese but that Thai acceptable to
                            both. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said Malaysians would like UNSYG
                            to name Thais. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            worried this matter two or three times with questions but in end
                            accepted proposal.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> mentioned Manila's thought that
                            political confrontation should also cease and discussed desirability of
                            stopping controversial radio broadcasts. Both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> indicated they were
                            interested in this aspect and agreed to stop anti-Malaysian radio
                            broadcasts and knock off political confrontation if other side would do
                            same.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> concluded this part presentation by
                            stating that as result his talks with all three parties he convinced
                            that each interested in peaceful settlement, that Malaysians and Phils
                            both feel situation deteriorating and that in his judgment all parties
                            willing to enter talks in good faith. He said he had left Jim Bell in
                                <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> and that if reports from him there
                            and from Ambs in other countries involved should indicate any change in
                            necessary atmosphere of good faith, he would tell this to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> questioned <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> closely whether <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> would come into conference as
                            “Prime Minister of Malaysia.” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s first reaction was that it would be impossible
                            for him to meet with <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> as
                            Prime Minister of Malaysia. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> explained
                            that he had discussed this issue with <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and had stressed to him that recognition could not
                            be pre-condition of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            and that each side could hold its own standpoint on this matter, i.e.,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> could come as <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> of Malaysia and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could meet with him,
                            regarding <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> in any way he
                            wanted. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> also <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0085"/>stressed that issue should be minimized by both sides
                            and not allowed to ruin chance for talks. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> finally accepted. (Indos
                            were perhaps somewhat persuaded by fact, which was spelled out to them,
                            that US reps regularly talk to ChiCom reps without involving recognition
                            question.)</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, with some assistance
                            from Gen <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName>, made strong attempt
                            revise talks in Tokyo to provide for withdrawal of troops along border
                            in Kalimantan by both Indos and British. They pressed hard on necessity
                            British issuing cease fire order at same time they would do so. “I can
                            only give order to my troops to cease fire if British give order to
                            theirs,” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said. There
                            was extended argument about this in which <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> made clear that he regarded Indos major offenders in
                            this matter and it was hardly possible to ask Malaysians or British to
                            announce cease fire. It was Indos who were making most of incursions
                            although there might have been few incidents by other side. It was Indos
                            who were out to crush Malaysia not vice versa. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said he would not be party to equating Indo military
                            activities with those defensive activities by other side.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> argued that in Tokyo
                            “two times I said 'both sides.'” Amb Zain interjected unhelpfully “We
                            Indonesians all understood there would be cease fire on both sides.” Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName>, too, said he had
                            understood that if Indonesia withdrew their troops British would also
                            withdraw theirs. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said withdrawal of
                            troops was impractical and was not what had been agreed in Tokyo.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName> said there were two
                            groups of fighters: regulars and “Kalimantan freedom fighters.” He said
                            latter would cooperate only if they thought that what Indo did would
                            benefit them. If British did not cease mopping up activities against
                            them they would defend themselves. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>
                            repeatedly reminded <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            it was Malaysians not British who required make commitments on military
                            activities in Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said arrangement would not be ideal
                            but there was no alternative. He said he would do what he could and that
                            US Ambassadors in capitals concerned would also do what they could do to
                            help keep incidents from getting out of hand. Main thing was to get
                            talks going. Surely guerrillas could protect themselves for few weeks.
                            If there were incidents they could be investigated. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> had proceeded to other capitals on basis
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s commitment to
                            him in Tokyo that he would issue cease fire order to Indo troops.
                            Without that there could be no talks.</p>
                        <p>8. After extended argument on this point, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> switched discussion to his problem of selling
                            cease fire to Indo people. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> whether
                            he would ask British “Are you willing silently or otherwise to order
                            cease fire”? <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said he had already asked
                            this of Malaysians and that their answer was affirmative. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> again stressed <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0086"/>that it was Indo military activity which was causing
                            trouble and which had to be stopped before talks could proceed. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> said it was clear to him that Malaysians
                            and those in support of them would welcome Indo cease fire.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and others finally
                            abandoned their attempts alter Tokyo agreement. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> pressed <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> earnestly, however, for general statement

                            Jan 23 that parties concerned all agreed on desirability of talks and

                            would make talks possible. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> agreed try
                            to make some general statement to this effect stressing however that he
                            wished to save most of this for announcement he would make in Bangkok.

                            meeting should be held Bangkok but insisted that venue for summit be
                            decided at ministers meeting and not beforehand. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> indicated he had promised
                            Japanese that summit might be held Tokyo but assured us there would be

                        <p>11. Min Chairul Saleh asked whether <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>
                            would talk with British about causes of tensions between them and
                            Indonesians. He referred particularly to British impounding C–130 spare
                            parts in <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> agreed consider discussing with British any thoughts on
                            Indo-British relationship which Indos could give him in memo form but
                            promised nothing. <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName> indicated
                            he would provide <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> with memo on <gloss target="#t_HK1">HK</gloss> situation prior <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>'s departure. Later, after dinner, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> raised this matter with

                            insistent that engines for C–130s which Indos had acquired from Lockheed
                            had been “confiscated” by British.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is frequently different man in Djakarta where he
                            is subject to and conscious of domestic political pressures than he is
                            outside Indonesia. This fits <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>'s
                            impression on this occasion. At times during this talk it was almost as
                            if agreement reached Tokyo didn't exist. However, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> (with some help from
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>) came around
                            at end and agreed to stand by Tokyo agreement. This was obviously
                            difficult for him in face situation here. In <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss>'s and my judgment situation is most delicate one which
                            will require utmost in effort and coordination to hold. Repeated Indo
                            reference during these talks to British “divide and rule” tactics and to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s alleged inclination
                            exploit any concessions by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for
                            domestic political purposes were two striking examples depth Indo

                            reached Tokyo. I think <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wants to resolve this matter although whether

                            words omitted):</p>
                        <p>“I have been following with great attention reports from British Reps in
                            area of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s efforts
                            secure suspension of Indonesian military confrontation against Malaysia.
                            We most grateful to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            for keeping us so fully informed. I am glad too that he seems be making
                            such good progress towards getting Indonesians stop their attacks.
                            Whatever ultimate outcome negotiations, suspension tragically
                            unnecessary fighting along Borneo border must be a clear gain.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, there is one aspect Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s otherwise helpful intervention which does
                            cause me some concern and which I shall want discuss with him when he
                            reaches London. This is emphasis he has been laying on need for “Asian
                            solution” to problem Indonesian <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0088"/>confrontation against Malaysia. I believe that what he means is that
                            next step should be meeting three Asian Governments involved: Indonesia,
                            Malaysia and Philippines. We would agree with this and, if such a
                            meeting were to open way for closer association these three countries on
                            entirely voluntary basis and without any element Indonesian coercion of
                            Malaysia, we would welcome this. We have never been opposed to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s concept of Maphilindo as
                            such, but only to its employment as pretext for isolating Malaysia from
                            Western support.</p>
                        <p>This brings me to nub of present message. Even if these three Asian
                            Governments met without any representatives Western Powers present,
                            their discussions are bound to include certain topics of direct concern
                            to Britain and West as whole. I am thinking particularly of main target
                            Indonesian hostility: the Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreement and base
                            facilities in Malaysia enjoyed by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            under this Agreement. If, as I fear they will, Indonesians make
                            abrogation these arrangements a condition for final termination
                            confrontation and restoration friendly relations with Malaysia, we think
                            Malaysia will be bound refuse and would be in Western interests that she
                            should do so. Otherwise, how can we ask Malaysia (with her population of
                            ten million) to entrust her future independence to good will of 100
                            million Indonesians? Secondly, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would
                            thereby be asked renounce all future prospects of making any effective
                            contribution to defence Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>These, I suggest, are not problems which West can afford consider in
                            isolation. They are not purely British problems and cannot be solved
                            without most far-reaching repercussions on future of Southeast Asia as a
                            whole or on unity and effectiveness Western Alliance. To take worse
                            possible case, termination Indonesian confrontation on terms likely lead
                            to neutralisation of Malaysia under Indonesian influence would have
                            profound effects in mainland Southeast Asia. Neighbouring Thailand might
                            reconsider her adhesion to Western Alliance. There would be
                            repercussions in Laos and Cambodia. Above all I think your problems in
                            South Vietnam would be greatly increased.</p>
                        <p>All this leads me to propose that, when our Prime Minister meets your
                            President in Washington next month, we should try to look at Western
                            policy in Southeast Asia as a whole rather than at individual problems
                            of Britain over Malaysia or of US over South Vietnam. When I say Western
                            policy, I am naturally also thinking of Australia and New Zealand, whose
                            interest is even more direct than that of either Britain or US. As I see
                            it, post-war extension of Communist influence in Southeast Asia has been
                            largely due to our failure achieve such a united approach to problems of
                            area as a whole. Again and again particular Western countries have
                            fought isolated and ultimately futile rear guard actions in a single
                            sector. Now, even if it is at eleventh hour, I think <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0089"/>we should attempt fresh approach. If you
                            agree, I hope you will also agree on importance of avoiding any
                            irrevocable commitment on nature of a final solution to problem
                            Indonesian confrontation until we have met and discussed this problem in
                            its wider context.”</p>

                        <p>4456. For Attorney General from Secretary. My warm congratulations on the
                            job you have done in Tokyo, Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Djakarta. It may
                            well prove to be a major turning point in the entire position in
                            Southeast Asia. As a minimum you have obtained public commitments from
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> which give us
                            powerful leverage to restrain him from rash action in the future.</p>
                        <p>In your talks in London<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">In a January 24
                                message to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, Home stated
                                that he looked forward to meeting <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert

                                continuing confrontation by other means do not encourage me to think
                                that he has in any way changed his spots or altered his aim which he
                                has just reiterated as 'crush Malaysia.' ” (Johnson Library,

                            to interfere in someone else's problem but that we were faced with a
                            major watershed in the future of our own relations with Indonesia.
                            President could not make a determination to proceed with aid in the face
                            of Indonesian guerrilla action against Malaysia. On the other hand to
                            discontinue aid would lead to complete rupture with Indonesia, seizure
                            by them of major US investments, and firm implantation of ChiCom
                            influence in Indonesia through <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. You
                            were highly successful in staying out of the details of a possible
                            solution but you did prepare an opportunity for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to back away without undue
                            loss of face and got for the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> a publicly declared suspension of military
                            confrontation which must relieve him.</p>

                            the Foreign Minister of Thailand. I want to tell you again how much I
                            appreciated the courtesy and consideration with which you received me.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> agrees with me
                            that we can all look with real satisfaction at the results of these
                            discussions which were due largely to the frank and constructive spirit
                            with which you approached them. If this spirit can be maintained through
                            the crucial weeks that lie ahead, there is no doubt that your nation and
                            its neighbors will have gone far to achieving a stable and mutually

                            agreeable to having Thailand designated by him as the disinterested

                            either side of the borders in Kalimantan during the period of the
                            conferences. The Secretary General will no doubt be getting in touch
                            with your representatives at the United Nations in New York, and I hope
                            that the appropriate arrangements can be made simply and quickly.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, it is essential in my judgment, that the spirit of our
                            discussions be maintained, that every effort be made to avoid armed
                            clashes, that political offensives, both overt and covert, be suspended,
                            and that all parties exercise the utmost restraint in responding to real
                            or imagined provocation by another.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I hope that the three countries will extend full cooperation to
                            the Secretary General and to Mr. Thanat Khoman, Foreign Minister of
                            Thailand, who are undertaking a most difficult role. They both deserve
                            our thanks.”</p>

                        <p>835. Department anticipates that within immediate future several of our
                            Embassies will be approached by principals in Indonesian- Malaysian
                            dispute concerning U.S. position on settlements to be sought <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0093"/>in forthcoming negotiations. Department
                            does not want any of our Ambassadors take initiatives to impose U.S.
                            ideas upon Asian principals themselves, but we do consider it important
                            that there be consensus among Ambassadors as well as between Ambassadors
                            and Department. Department's thoughts on optimum settlement which we
                            could foresee are set forth below:</p>
                        <p>Our over-all security interests in region are such that we obviously
                            would not welcome settlement which would seriously undermine our
                            position in region or that of our Western allies. In effect, we are
                            willing to go along with any settlement freely negotiated by principals
                            provided it falls within these limits.</p>
                        <p>Following are minimum results which we believe our interests require
                            emerge from any settlement:</p>
                        <p>1. Indonesian assaults on Malaysia in form guerrilla incursions and
                            terrorist activities must be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>2. Sovereignty and territorial integrity Malaysia must be preserved.
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> only. This does not necessarily
                            rule out some sort of pro forma testing popular will in Sabah and
                            Sarawak but does rule out any formula which casts doubt on present legal
                            status these states as part of Malaysia. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Basic orientation Malaysia and Philippines as members Free World
                            system of alliances must not be compromised in fact or by
                            implication.</p>
                        <p>4. Security of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> nations will depend on
                            presence in area of sufficient Western power to contain Communist Bloc
                            until such time as <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> nations are able
                            provide their own defense, which still in remote future. No settlement
                            which anticipates early departure U.S. or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military presence or adds to difficulties we face in
                            maintaining it would be acceptable or realistic. British military
                            establishment in Malaysia must remain until such time as British and
                            Malaysians themselves freely determine that its presence no longer
                            necessary. U.S. bases in Philippines must be recognized as bilateral
                            matter between U.S. and Philippines, not one of legitimate concerns to
                            other two parties.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing results conceivably could emerge even if forthcoming
                            negotiations failed achieve formal settlement, since they require
                            nothing more than Indonesia's renunciation force in pursuit its policies
                            toward Malaysia. Although this sort of “agreement to disagree” would be
                            preferable to all-out confrontation, it would not be satisfactory. In
                            our view, optimum settlement of dispute would require following
                            additional results:</p>
                        <p>1. Resumption diplomatic relations between Malaysia and other two.</p>
                        <p>2. Agreement on method of disposing of Philippine claim to Sabah once and
                            for all.</p>
                        <p>3. Cessation all aspects Indonesian political and propaganda
                            confrontation against Malaysia and of all Malaysian countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>4. Full restoration normal transportation and communications between
                            Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>5. Lifting of Indonesian economic boycott against Malaysia and of
                            Malaysian countermeasures. (We would not, however, expect Indonesians to
                            drop their campaign to divert export trade from Singapore, but merely to
                            rationalize it, stretch it out, and remove it from context of
                            confrontation.) </p>
                        <p>Would be unrealistic hope that all of foregoing can be included in neat
                            package worked out at Bangkok tripartite meeting for ratification
                            subsequent summit. At same time, U.S. has made major effort to bring
                            this meeting about, and that we have committed good deal our influence
                            and prestige in process. Matter has now been placed in hands Asian
                            principals—where it should be—but if they fail achieve enough progress
                            to insure that there is no return to all-out confrontation of past few
                            months, situation will inevitably deteriorate dangerously. We envisage
                            tripartite meeting as forum either to reach firm settlement or to pave
                            way for further negotiations which will result in settlement, and we
                            think it absolutely essential that meeting achieve—at very least—enough
                            success to create real, irreversible momentum toward settlement.</p>
                        <p>Request immediate reaction of Ambassadors to these views.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">In telegram 676 from Kuala Lumpur, February 3, the
                                Charge stated “I would go beyond minimum requirements set forth in

                                Malaysia, Indo military within Malaysia must be withdrawn and Indos

                                the Embassy in Djakarta replied that the Department's analysis of
                                minimum acceptable terms for a settlement was “sound.”

                            function in Eastern Malaysia despite SYG's unwillingness designate
                            Thailand. Dept has no evidence, however, that Thais have taken or
                            contemplate action to pre-position observers in Malaysia or
                            Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>2) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> seems agreeable to
                            accepting Bangkok language on disengagement Indo guerrillas (Bangkok's

                            but makes it clear he does not in fact intend withdraw them until
                            “political settlement” reached.</p>

                            centering on further supervised determination of will of people in

                            first reported—no real agreement on North Borneo claim and renewed
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> pressure for self-determination. </p>
                        <p>If foregoing is correct summary, situation may be headed toward new
                            impasse, and further efforts to head it off are necessary. Essential
                            elements in problem are presence Indo guerrillas, need for further

                        <p>In regard guerrillas, Dept's understanding is that there now about
                            150–200 Indo nationals operating in Eastern Malaysia among some 2,000
                            locals. Great majority now inactive, and some removing themselves from
                            scene by surrender or return Indonesia. This is very small number, is
                            manageable military threat, and can be substantially eliminated by
                            attrition if <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> keep up quiet pressure as suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 668 to Kuala Lumpur.<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">Dated February 13. (Ibid.)</note> Only real danger

                            Indos until guerrilla problem solved, but believes failure to meet would
                            make situation worse. Present cease fire based on assumption talks in
                            progress, and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> refusal to meet could
                            be interpreted by Indos as evidenced agreement with <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> violated by <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>, position which <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> might well support. Dept and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>'s friends well aware <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> has excellent legal and moral case, but if negotiations
                            fail because <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> has broken them off,
                            Malaysian position would undoubtedly be weakened in eyes much of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. For this reason Dept believes it
                            important <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> continue participate in
                            meetings. It can continue insist Indos withdraw guerrillas before making
                            broader settlement, but must not allow Indos get upper hand by breaking
                            off talks.</p>
                        <p>Dept does not wish to be drawn into substance of general settlement, but
                            believes <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> puts itself in no danger by
                            agreeing to further meetings and discussions. <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> not obliged accept proposals re self-determination <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0097"/>which it feels are humiliating or

                            out that next national elections in Borneo, presumably in four or five
                            years, will inevitably reflect any significant popular disaffection with
                            Malaysia. Dept continues believe that the principals can work out some
                            agreeable formula if they keep talking, while breaking off talks might
                            well cause cease fire to collapse.</p>

                            following, making clear you speaking under instructions:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s agreement with
                            Attorney General did not deal with continuing presence guerrillas on
                            Malaysian soil after Bangkok talks began, and can by no stretch of
                            imagination be construed to sanction this interpretation.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cannot expect Malaysians to
                            bargain over withdrawal guerrillas or to offer any concessions in return
                            for their withdrawal, and we would not consider asking them to do so.
                            Presence of guerrillas is not negotiating asset for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, but has become serious liability in
                            working toward peaceful settlement. Any effort reinforce or supply
                            guerrillas would, of course, violate <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> agreement and be intolerably provocative to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> fears Indonesia would lose
                            prestige by announcing withdrawal these forces, matter could be settled
                            without publicity. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could and should
                            simply inform <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> of its acceptance
                            compromise language on disengagement and then proceed withdraw
                            guerrillas without announcing fact to anyone. </p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I am getting concerned that the agreement to negotiate the difference in
                            this dispute is beginning to come unstuck. It seems to me there are two
                            problems:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is unwilling to
                            give up the bargaining power represented by the continued presence of
                            Indonesian controlled guerrillas in Malaysian territory without
                            simultaneous political concessions from the Malaysians.</p>
                        <p>2. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> is essentially
                            unwilling to continue the talks until after <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has agreed on a withdrawal.
                            His position is further complicated by the pending election in April,
                            which makes it difficult for him to devise any significant political
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>As a result, it is doubtful whether the next Ministerial meeting,
                            scheduled for February 25, will achieve any results; if indeed, it takes
                            place at all. In the meantime, we are still living under the time threat
                            of the Broomfield Amendment.</p>
                        <p>The situation suggests to me that we must take some initiative between
                            now and the 25th, designed to keep the next meeting from breaking apart,
                            and perhaps getting us through the period of the Malaysian elections.
                            Several thoughts have occurred to me:</p>
                        <p>1. We might tell <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that
                            time is running out for us for domestic reasons, and that unless there
                            is some progress in the next talks, the administration will find itself
                            in an impossible situation with respect to the Broomfield Amendment.
                            Something has to be found to save the next Foreign Ministers' meeting.
                            One possibility is an agreement by Sukarno to withdraw members of
                            regular Indonesian forces who may be in North Borneo. During the
                            Attorney General's trip we were under the impression that there were no
                            regular forces in North Kalimantan, only native guerrillas. Now it turns
                            out that the British have captured twelve Indonesian marines, although
                            they have kept this quiet. It would be to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s interest in the eyes of
                            world opinion if he agreed to withdraw his regular people.</p>
                        <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0099"/>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s visit to Djakarta
                            gives us an opportunity to use him as a way of speaking bluntly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. A draft message

                            is a step back from the understanding he had with the Attorney

                            transaction was that the parties agreed to stop the fighting and to

                            of Malaysia, and Maphilindo were to be discussed initially at the
                            Ministerial Conferences, and then at the Summit. We might suggest to the

                            demand to a withdrawal of regular Indonesian personnel. We should ask
                            the Attorney General to get some of these thoughts across either to the

                                little domestic opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s “crush Malaysia” campaign and that
                                confrontation enjoyed wide support in Indonesia. Still the
                                Indonesian military was anxious to avoid a direct clash with the
                                British and there were no indications of major military preparations
                                in Kalimantan, just stepped up paramilitary operations. The Embassy
                                suggested steps to induce Indonesia to make a 180 degree turn and
                                accept a peaceful settlement. (Ibid.)</note> On eve Bangkok meeting,
                            prospects major progress not promising in absence any signs acceptable
                            formula on guerrilla question in offing. Seems obvious Indonesians will
                            have to give at least part on this question if meeting not to break down
                            at outset. Main effort all participants obviously must be some forward
                            motion on guerrilla question and at least preliminary discussion other
                            issues to permit negotiations to continue.</p>

                                telegram 1802, the Embassy suggested a pre-conference approach to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to: 1)

                                and 3) urge that Indonesia make known its position on a political
                                settlement at Bangkok, that is “put cards on table and get
                                negotiating process started.” (Ibid.)</note> In addition these
                            points, you should also make following:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> must expect and
                            be prepared tackle guerrilla question before going into political
                            matters. Must also be prepared give some ground on this question. <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> knows that most of world will accept
                            logic their position this issue and will have to insist on some
                            rectification to protect their position.</p>
                        <p>2. Since Attorney General's mission, US has been poised at watershed in
                            relations with Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> aware our basic sympathy for Indonesia and our
                            desire to be helpful. Attorney General mission itself ample proof of
                            this. But ball now entirely in Indonesian court. We can be of no further
                            help to them, politically or otherwise, if current cease-fire and talks
                            break down. We now need from Indonesians same degree initiative in
                            moving toward settlement that we took last January. No point asserting
                            that we should put pressure on other side rather than Indonesia. We have
                            already done maximum <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0101"/>possible in
                            encouraging others to understand Indonesian position and meet GOI
                            half-way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">For Kuala Lumpur</hi>: You should let <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> know we are urging Indonesians
                            (1) to take more responsible position on guerrillas, and (2) to start
                            spelling out what they mean by “sweetening the pill.” If Indonesians
                            give any indication at Bangkok that they moving in this direction, we
                            hope he will hear them out fully, explore their proposals and not reject
                            their approaches out of hand. If Indo terms unacceptable, he should
                            either make counter offer or defer discussion to later meeting.</p>
                        <p>We see minimum objective Bangkok meeting as that of preventing further
                            deterioration and keeping negotiation process going. We recognize that
                            Malaysians, as aggrieved party and with elections coming up, find
                            current situation hard to take. Even though present cease-fire far from
                            satisfactory to Malaysians, however, it is preferable to all-out
                            resumption Indonesian military confrontation—particularly when number of
                            indications suggest time may be working in Malaysia's favor.</p>
                        <p>Re question Thai observers, we pleased have <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>'s assurance (Kuala Lumpur's 773)<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">Dated February 28. (Ibid.)</note> that question will
                            be settled prior Bangkok meeting. Leisurely pace and delicate
                            sensitivities demonstrated by Malaysians to date, however, leave
                            impression that they (and perhaps Thais as well) do not really
                            understand why prompt pre-positioning observers so important their
                            position. If you think it will help, suggest you continue express our
                            active interest in getting them moving.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, we puzzled why <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> feels observers need access Indonesian side border
                            before they can be effective. Understanding on observers was that they
                            are to investigate incidents, which presumably will only occur Malaysian
                            territory. “Seeing what Indonesians up to” is eminently not part their
                            agreed function, and any suggestion it be made part thereof almost sure
                            cause whole observer concept to collapse.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">For Bangkok</hi>: Suggest you convey to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> general outline foregoing prior
                            meeting, emphasizing that minimum objective must be to keep talks going
                            and keep cease-fire reasonably intact. Re his comment that he would
                            welcome any formulae that may occur to us (Bangkok's 1406),<note n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">Dated February 29. (Ibid.)</note> suggest you point
                            out that we feel main thing is to get Indonesians to surface their terms
                            for “sweetening the pill.” Once these in sight, we could all start
                            looking for possible formula.</p>

                                to reach a peaceful settlement with Malaysia, but was being

                                using its relationship with key army leaders to convince them to

                            foreign policy and economic problems can lead. Net impact of this

                        <p>Essence of problem seems to be that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> recognizes our refusal to support confrontation,
                            accepts our statements of support for Malaysia although annoyed by them,
                            and is willing to face possible loss of both current and potential U.S.
                            aid. He seems to discount chances that U.S.-Indo relations can
                            deteriorate to breaking point if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            presses its quarrel with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> to stage of
                            open hostility, and in general assumes that he can achieve his
                            objectives by methods including continuing guerrilla action without
                            seriously endangering his international position.</p>

                        <p>Problem is accentuated by fact, which emerges in above references, that
                            those who are in position to influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> toward rational foreign and economic policies
                            particularly military, are not doing so.</p>
                        <p>In case of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, it is obviously in
                            commies' interest to encourage present course toward mounting
                            international tension and domestic economic collapse. Department has
                            noted recent reports that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has lured
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> into agreement
                            that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will not play up current

                            will keep up active confrontation, but that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is at same time pushing campaign against foreign
                            business interests. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> undoubtedly
                            wants break with U.S. to permit takeover U.S. investments including oil.
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is thus ready to profit now from
                            confrontation and be ready with plan based on break with West if
                            economic conditions reach crisis stage.</p>
                        <p>Indo military on other hand, seems to lack understanding of where Indo
                            policy is leading, and fails to recognize that present combination of
                            confrontation and increasing coldness toward West plays only into hands
                            of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and other extremists. Since our
                            efforts influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            directly and via <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            have not succeeded in modifying Indonesian policy, Department believes
                            we should now try to build up pressures on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> from Indonesian military
                            sources in favor of rational settlement with Malaysia and decent
                            relations with free world. In view of attitudes described in references,
                            this would seem to require “educational” program aimed at military
                            leaders. Department would not suggest anything which might get back to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as U.S. campaign
                            against him, but would expect that if situation is effectively and
                            forcefully described, significant number of Indo military who have some
                            ability effect course of events would understand where present course is
                            leading and would try to change or restrain it.</p>
                        <p>Department has noted <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>'s
                            suggestion (Kuala Lumpur's 787) that time has come to draw on

                            off <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> before it too late. This should
                            be done to maximum extent possible in context this “educational”
                            campaign, since our capital with them will be completely expended in any
                            event should Indo actions force us side openly against them.</p>
                        <p>Appears to Department that Col. Benson and attaches should see <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and such other military
                            leaders as they and Ambassador think useful.</p>
                        <p>Embassy familiar with most appropriate lines to take with each group,
                            i.e., stressing that present situation playing directly into <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> hands, and will be tailoring them to
                            fit individual targets. In addition the obvious points, should try
                            impress upon them the following over-all assessment:</p>
                        <p>1. If Indo resumes all-out confrontation result can only be (1) complete
                            breach between Indo and free world, with Indo forced either <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0104"/>eke out meager existence in isolation or
                            turn as suppliant to Bloc, which would then respond, if at all, with aid
                            designed to help <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, or (2) growth of
                            internal pressures within Indo of such magnitude as to threaten both
                            present leadership and internal unity. Which- ever one materializes,
                            Indo's prestige and status as nation would be shattered.</p>
                        <p>2. Indo military must face fact that if they escalate military
                            confrontation they risk war with British, who have capacity knock out
                            Indo offensive ability quickly. Such defeat would end position of
                            control of Indo military leaders.</p>
                        <p>3. As far as U.S. concerned, we being driven to point at which we
                            recognize growing possibility parting of ways with Indo. For years U.S.
                            Govt has made sustained effort understand Indo aspirations and help
                            attain them. In West Irian case, we went to length of risking strained
                            relations with old and close allies in order encourage peaceful
                            settlement favorable to Indo. Present case bears no relation to West
                            Irian since it involves Indo campaign not against colonial territory to
                            which it has any sort of claim but against sovereign state which U.S.
                            and most of world value as friend. Despite our inability accept Indo
                            position vis-a-vis Malaysia, however, and in face strongly adverse
                            reaction both from U.S. public and from U.S. allies, U.S. Govt has made
                            continuous effort (culminating in Attorney General's mission) to
                            encourage peaceful settlement on terms not adverse to Indo's legitimate
                            interests. Despite this record, we now find U.S. singled out as target
                            by much of Indo press and leadership, and U.S. companies in Indo
                            threatened with seizure or violence. U.S. Govt and people cannot be
                            expected put up with this forever, and must react strongly if our
                            interests damaged by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Would be naive for Indos to think there are any differences or
                            conflicts in U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies toward
                            Southeast Asia which they can exploit. U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are allies. <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            Treaty obligations apply if Australian and New Zealand forces
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>5. In considering implications foregoing, Indos should not be so naive as
                            to think they can find useful alternative support among Western
                            Europeans (French, Dutch), Afro-Asians or Bloc. While certain Western
                            Europeans have pursued policy similar to ours in avoiding taking sides,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can be sure none will abandon
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Malaysia if forced make
                            choice. Nor can real support be found among AA's, most of whom recognize
                            Malaysia, have nothing against British, are preoccupied with own
                            problems and, in any event, have nothing to offer in way tangible
                            support. As far as Bloc concerned, Indos must be aware situation has
                            changed radically since early postwar days of East-West confrontation
                            when foe of one automatically taken up as friend of other.</p>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>6. By drying up sources foreign aid and disrupting trade, confrontation
                            has seriously hurt Indo economy and virtually eliminated hopes for
                            economic development in near future. Quite aside from its impact on
                            population as whole, Indo military must realize this directly affects
                            them: However large and well equipped its forces in being, Indo is not
                            and will not be significant military power—able realistically claim
                            capacity to defend country—so long as industrial-technical base to
                            sustain these forces totally absent. At best will take years or decades
                            create this base, but every day confrontation continues pushes that goal
                            farther in future.</p>
                        <p>Department realizes carrying out foregoing will be delicate task, but
                            believes that time for such an effort has arrived. Request Embassy

                                    <persName>Jones</persName> reported on an hour and 10 minute

                                on the morning of March 6. The discussion suggested to
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> that the Indonesia military were
                                determined to continue confrontation, but not to the point of large
                                scale conflict, were aware of the threat of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, and were unprepared to deal with
                                Indonesia's economic problems. <persName>Jones</persName> reported
                                that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, “avoided like

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Indonesia/Malaysia</hi>. There are reports that
                            discussions between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> have been broken
                            off. The reports may be exaggerated, but they did bring to
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s mind the question of whether we can
                            much longer put off the Presidential determination of whether Indonesia
                            should continue to receive economic assistance. He felt it was
                            inevitable that we would have to cut off aid.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> recounted the following
                                discussion at the February 24 White House staff meeting:”
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> commented that he thought it was
                                about time we took some action against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and that we should
                                initiate steps to cut off our economic aid from him. He realized
                                that this was an unpopular position, that the Attorney General
                                probably did not agree with it, and that he
                                    (<persName>Bundy</persName>) perhaps could be talked out of his
                                present thinking. Nevertheless, he felt that we could not continue
                                to support <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> if he
                                continues to behave as he now is.” (Ibid.) On February 25 <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> wrote
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> a 2-page note explaining why it was
                                the wrong time for a “showdown” with Indonesia. (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, Indonesia, Vol. I, Memos
                                11/63–4/64)</note> He raised several questions on the matter,
                            however. First, he wondered whether the Attorney General would be of the
                            same mind, or whether the Attorney General would say that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> has behaved as badly as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> affirmed that the <gloss target="#t_AG1">AG</gloss> would say the latter, and with some
                            justification. The argument was that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> could afford to be statesmanlike but wasn't. He is
                            evidently up for election and, although <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> said there is no competition,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> responded by saying that high level
                            officials running for re-election do not like to hear what “shoo-ins”
                            they were. This discussion closed with <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            commenting that the aid determination would have to be dealt with
                            soon.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, came to see me, after having
                            seen the Department, to tell us that Sir <persName corresp="#p_BSGEJ1">Garfield Barwick</persName> had told the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> he agreed that there could be no
                            meeting of the three Chiefs of State until the Indonesian guerrillas had
                            been withdrawn, and that there was at present no cease-fire. We do not
                            know what advice, if any, the British had given the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> before the meeting; but we are
                            trying to find out.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said he was prepared to
                            go along with the principle that guerrillas should be withdrawn, such
                            withdrawal to start as soon as political discussions start, and to be
                            paced according to the progress of the discussions. His position is
                            apparently unacceptable to the Malaysians.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the Malaysians issued a communique<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">The text was transmitted in telegram 1464 from Kuala Lumpur, March
                                5. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–1
                                INDON–MALAYSIA)</note> which charged Indonesia with breaking the
                            cease-fire arranged by the Attorney General. The communique ended by
                            saying, “Since the cease-fire has been repeatedly violated by the
                            Indonesians, it would be futile to regard the cease-fire as operative.”
                            As of the moment, the Malaysians have not <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0108"/>yet requested the Thais to send any observers to North
                            Borneo to observe and report on the alleged violations.</p>
                        <p>I have learned this morning that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSH1">Beale</persName> has requested an appointment with Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> for tomorrow
                                (<persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> is in Denver
                            today). We have been told very informally (and this knowledge must be
                            protected) that <persName corresp="#p_BSH1">Beale</persName> intends to
                            present an Australian paper on what should be done in the case of an
                            escalation of the dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It does not seem to me to be in the
                            interest of the United States to see a breakdown of the cease-fire
                            negotiated by the Attorney General, nor to permit our British and
                            Australian friends to believe that we will participate in planning for
                            an escalation of this conflict. I don't understand how we can fail to
                            use every lever at our command to prevent the outbreak of another ugly
                            war behind our backs while we are fighting in South Vietnam. I do not
                            see how we can avoid being drawn into such a conflict in view of our
                            relations with the parties, relations which are based both on politics
                            and, in the case of Australia, on a treaty.</p>
                        <p>We should also not forget that the Philippine attitude toward our bases
                            there would be equivocal, to say the least if such a conflict
                            started.</p>
                        <p>In the longer range, I don't see how there is any hope of maintaining a
                            Western presence in Asia if we cannot somehow avoid having one of the
                            three most powerful non-Chinese countries become actively hostile to the
                            West. The surest way to have this happen would be for us to stand idly
                            by and let events take their course. That is what we are now doing.</p>
                        <p>We should tell the Malaysians, British and Australians that in our view
                            the cease-fire must be maintained, the Thais must be asked to go to
                            North Borneo and the conference should break up in an atmosphere in
                            which another conference is still possible. We should say publicly that
                            we hope the cease-fire will remain in effect.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">In the margin next to the last paragraph <persName>Bundy</persName>

                            yet to make a definite break. I'm fascinated that Indos, though
                            continuing infiltration, seem more defensive and unsure of selves.</p>
                        <p>Talk now is about <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula:
                            (a) disengagement, i.e. gradual withdrawal; (b) simultaneous renewal
                            political discussions; (c) agreement in principle to Summit after
                            Malaysia 25 April elections. Indos boggling at withdrawal w/o clear
                            understanding Malays will talk; Malays adamant against talking w/o
                            substantial Indo withdrawals.</p>

                        <p>1. I and other members of my staff in contact with key members <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and military leaders have for past
                            several months been using most of arguments presented in first <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and we will continue use them.
                            Difficult to say what effect our argumentation has had. Our
                            representations have not perceptibly succeeded slowing down
                            confrontation. There even may be danger that, given Indo psychology, our
                            showing too much worry about their problems counter-productive.
                            Subandrio recently quipped to diplomatic group in my presence:
                            “Americans are more worried about ceasefire than we are.” Nevertheless
                            believe we should continue try deflect them through reminder several
                            adverse consequences their current policies and actions lest they tend
                            brush these under rug.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not believe that Sukarno either going down road of confrontation
                            alone with support dragging its feet or that he primarily responding to
                            pressure from military or others (although <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is of course trying its best to push him). <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is calling shots.</p>
                        <p>3. Re attitude of military, we believe following are salient aspects.
                            Military leaders:</p>
                        <p>(a) Want to stay ahead of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and assert
                            leadership on emotional national issue (remembering they nearly lost
                            leadership to <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in case West
                            Irian);</p>
                        <p>(b) Have no intention letting confrontation develop into real war. Even
                            threats resupply to guerrillas probably more for propaganda reasons than
                            otherwise. High ranking officer just last day or two told Col. Benson
                            “They can take care of themselves;”</p>
                        <p>(c) Think that in carefully muted and orchestrated guerrilla effort (not
                            “all out” confrontation) Indo has winning proposition (we believe that
                            in long run, subject of course to unpredictable actions others, they may
                            be right);</p>
                        <p>(d) Are prepared to react to <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> moves
                            which they are confident they can handle but have no other plans for
                            taking over and improving nation;</p>
                        <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>(e) Like civilian leaders, support <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> because they feel they have no choice but to
                            keep their position and wait for something to turn up;</p>
                        <p>(f) Are aware that economic situation is tough but do not believe it
                            involves political risks they cannot contain or that will seriously
                            limit their actions; besides, they themselves as privileged elite do not
                            feel effect and pinch to extent most other Indos do;</p>
                        <p>(g) Have, together with some civilian leaders, keen recollection way
                            situations have developed in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba and West Irian
                            and their reading of these situations leads them to believe that
                            advantage lies with guerrillas rather than with defenders. They regard
                            gambles of escalation and economic hardship as minimal and worth
                            taking.</p>
                        <p>4. Any promotion by us of crisis psychology here in respect to US-Indo
                            relations plays into hands <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> whose
                            objective is to cause rupture there. Granted pressures necessary to
                            attempt to keep <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> from
                            running wild, they should be calculated, low-key ones.</p>
                        <p>5. Specifically on numbered paragraphs of first <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> we offer seriatim following
                            comments;</p>
                        <p>(1) We should avoid overestimating as well as underestimating effects on
                            Indonesia (as well as on Malaysia) of confrontation. We are not
                            convinced that Indo will be entirely strapped for aid. There have been
                            reports credit offers presently in Indo hands of nearly $500 million
                            (admittedly, mostly for capital projects). Sov $250 million credit of
                            1960, although earmarked for capital projects, could if USSR agrees be
                            shifted to more pressing Indo needs. Sovs have given no recent
                            indication of any intention to permit significant shift. Japan,
                            Netherlands, Germany and France in descending order have given evidence
                            willingness extend commercial credits which will establish them in
                            potential Indo market. In recent talk here on TV, Sov Amb expanded on
                            availability Sov aid and trade. Thus far Sov aid has been intended and
                            has operated to strengthen <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and has
                            had little effect on <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> one way or
                            other. Parenthetically there have probably never been more private
                            foreign commercial representatives in Indo than at present time.</p>
                        <p>(2) Indos aware of risk escalation (which they assume, however, would
                            throw conflict onto world level). Military leaders intend keep
                            operations involving British in low gear and in jungles where they think
                            they can in time win. They think they have initiative and can make it as
                            hot or cold as they want and in this way safeguard against
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>(3) We assume these statements envisage major conflict and US
                            involvement, such as meeting <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            commitments. Otherwise we believe <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            will try avoid break with us and we think US should also try to avoid
                            break with Indo, unless provocation becomes intolerable.</p>
                        <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0112"/>
                        <p>(4) Indos probably believe and hope US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will see situation here in terms their individual
                            interests and that this will work to divide them. We have emphasized,
                            and confident they fully aware of, US commitments to <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(5) In addition comment on possible material support above, we assume
                            reluctance by <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> and others to see
                            Malaysia issue thrown into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> indicates
                            some potential A–A and Bloc support for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(6) With their theories “territorial warfare” Indo leaders probably see
                            situation differently and very likely think that major assault by major
                            power is unlikely because of fear by such power of escalation. In
                            extreme circumstances they also apparently assume that Sov Bloc would
                            come to their assistance. CAS has reports of informal offers of
                            unspecified aid from ChiComs. They aware of and apparently willing take
                            this risk, if forced into it, although will make every effort avoid
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>Additional and concluding comments and recommendations:</p>
                        <p>(a) US objective in Western Pacific of keeping Indo in free world orbit
                            or at least denying area to Bloc seems to us to be overriding
                            consideration in our approach to Malaysia problem, subject only to US
                            policy interest in creation of secure, stable and viable Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>(b) We would think that reasons which have led US <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> complete break with Cambodia despite Sihanouk's
                            provocations would apply in even more important and convincing way in
                            case of Indonesia, up to point of intolerability.</p>
                        <p>(c) US should insofar as possible avoid quarreling directly with Indo on
                            Malaysia, continue to urge ceasefire and talks seeking political
                            settlement; and preserve US presence Indo.</p>
                        <p>(d) US should at same time avoid both becoming involved militarily or in
                            being trapped into sponsoring particular compromise or being drawn
                            directly into the negotiating picture in any manner which would give
                            Indos further advantage.</p>
                        <p>(e) So long as present Malaysian crisis continues, US should, with
                            certain exceptions which are clearly in our interest, respond to Indo
                            requests for additional economic and military assistance with
                            expressions of regret that we must await settlement Malaysian problem
                            (exception to this would be US support for relief of hunger through

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Rab</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I appreciate your March 6 letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Attached,
                                but not printed. In this letter <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName> put forward three possible actions: (1) a
                                Malaysian request, backed by all the Western Powers, for an early
                                meeting of the Security Council; (2) an unmistakable warning from
                                the United States to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that failure to withdraw Indonesian
                                guerrillas and resume negotiations would entail full U.S. support
                                for Malaysia; or (3) joint representations by such Asian Powers as
                                Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and others to Indonesia.</note>
                            succinctly setting forth the dilemma we all face in trying to ease the
                            situation between Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>Prospects for a negotiated settlement certainly are not particularly
                            bright at the moment, although I do feel there is still a chance that
                            our continued efforts can eventually bridge the gap between them. The
                            second Bangkok meeting was disappointing in many respects. It did,
                            however, produce <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName>'
                            three-point formula which, if the Indonesians can be induced to accept
                            it, may still serve to keep negotiations alive and to lead to the
                            withdrawal of the Indonesian guerrillas. As you know, we have been
                            pressing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> hard to
                            accept this formula. Although the results are still inconclusive, we
                            believe—perhaps over-optimistically—that we can detect some slight
                            movement in the hitherto intransigent Indonesian position. We will
                            continue our efforts.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I am happy to see that your efforts to dissuade the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> from declaring “general
                            mobilization” have so far been successful. A gesture of this sort could
                            only have exacerbated the situation to Malaysia's disadvantage while
                            adding little to Malaysia's strength. Although the limited call up
                            actually proclaimed by the Malaysians <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0114"/>may evoke some noise from Djakarta, it should have
                            considerably less impact than would a general mobilization call.</p>
                        <p>If our current efforts to make some use of the <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula should fail, a fresh
                            initiative of some sort may be possible to maintain the hope of a
                            peaceful settlement. The precise form such initiative should take,
                            however, will probably have to be determined pretty much on an ad hoc
                            basis in the light of the precise positions of each side at the moment
                            the failure becomes apparent.</p>
                        <p>It may be, however, that we will eventually be forced to the conclusion
                            that further negotiations between the principals have no chance of
                            success. This could come about if it became certain beyond doubt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was unwilling to
                            call off his military confrontation with- out concessions that would
                            threaten Malaysia's basic interests. I do not think we have come to that
                            point yet, however, and I doubt that detailed contingency planning to
                            meet it would be profitable at this stage.</p>
                        <p>Since the need for a fresh initiative may shortly arise, I have examined
                            with interest the three specific possibilities you suggest.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we would be reluctant to see the dispute brought before the
                            Security Council at the present moment. Our delegations in New York have
                            examined this possibility and concluded that a referral to Security
                            Council at this time would not be in Malaysia's interest. We by no means
                            preclude resort to the Security Council if all prospects for direct
                            negotiations are foreclosed or if the Indonesians intensify the scale of
                            their military activities, but we doubt that the time is yet ripe for
                            this. I believe that the contingency planning carried out by our
                            delegations in New York will permit us to move into the Security Council
                            with minimum delay once the decision is taken.</p>
                        <p>As to your second suggestion, you know that we have been putting
                            sustained direct pressure on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to modify his position. In the process, we have
                            made clear to him that we have reached a watershed in our relations with
                            Indonesia and that the future course of these relations depends on his
                            actions in the dispute. Our aid has already been cut to the point at
                            which it will soon consist of little more than training—actually more
                            beneficial to us in terms of influencing the next generation than it is
                            to Sukarno. He has been put on notice that even this aid may well be cut
                            off unless the situation eases. Beyond this, we have made sure that he
                            is fully aware of the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            implications in the situation.</p>
                        <p>As you can see, we have in effect already warned <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that the friendship of the
                            United States and any prospect of future support from the United States
                            will be lost to him unless he modifies his position. We will repeat this
                            warning as often as seems useful, and if it fails to move him we will
                            implement it.</p>
                        <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0115"/>
                        <p>As to your third point, there may be merit in examining the possibility
                            of bringing other Asian powers into the scene, either individually or
                            jointly. On the other hand, two of the countries you mentioned—Thailand
                            and the Philippines—are already in the thick of it, and we would not
                            want to supersede their current efforts until they have run their
                            course.</p>
                        <p>You can be sure that, from our side, we do not wish to see things drift
                            in this dangerous situation. Our officials and yours are in close
                            contact at a number of levels, and we will continue to explore, jointly,
                            every opening we can detect.<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">On March 19

                        <p>794. Djakarta's 1920.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">In telegram 1920 from
                                Djakarta, March 17, <persName>Jones</persName> reported that after a
                                meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, they agreed
                                to accept the <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula
                                provided all parties agreed that Malaysia was prepared to commence
                                high-level talks on a political settlement when actual disengagement
                                began and would not be rigid on timing for withdrawals. For the time
                                being Indonesia would continue ambassadorial talks with the same
                                understanding on disengagement as would be applied to ministerial
                                talks. Furthermore, there could be no publicity about the <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula agreement. If the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula was made
                                public, Indonesia would deny it had agreed to it. (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s conditional
                            acceptance <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula could be
                            significant step in breaking current impasse if all parties prepared
                            follow it up. As we see situation, our immediate objectives are (a) to
                            halt further Indo guerrilla buildup in East Malaysia and to start
                            process of withdrawal, and (b) to provide forum for continuing
                            tripartite talks to fill gap until Malaysian elections and, hopefully,
                            to start preliminary discussion political settlement. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s agreement seems offer
                            hope of achieving both.</p>
                        <p>Most obvious hazards in next few days would seem include following:
                            Actual wording of conditions attached to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> acceptance could deviate so widely from that stated in
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> or could be couched in
                            such offensive language as to preclude Malaysian acceptance. Even if
                            wording follows that specified in reftel, Malaysians may still back off
                            from position stated by <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> in
                            Bangkok or insist on further clarification Indo position. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> might also yield to temptation
                            and start crowing publicly about Malaysian victory. Or <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> could decide cap his success by
                            leaking whole story to press.</p>
                        <p>We would appreciate posts' suggestions on how best exploit situation and
                            avoid hazards. Not much can be done, of course, until we see what
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> actually gets from
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>One problem to be faced if Indos accept formula is that of publicity.
                            While desirable that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s strict injunction against publicizing arrangement
                            be observed, record for secrecy in past somewhat similar circumstances
                            very poor. Formal public reference of some sort to effect discussions
                            being resumed would probably be necessary to minimize press speculation
                            when becomes known Ambassadors getting together in Bangkok. Difficult to
                            see how Malaysians could agree to any publicity on talks, however,
                            unless they could tell their people <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            had agreed <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0117"/>start withdrawals.
                            Might be possible resolve this problem if <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> would make brief non-committal public statement
                            along following lines after clearing it with all three principals: “As
                            result diplomatic conversations carried on at second Bangkok meeting,
                            Indos, Malaysians and Phils have agreed take certain measures to relieve
                            tensions in area. Further exploratory talks between Ambassadors of the
                            three countries in Bangkok will be taking place in coming weeks.” Would

                            talk reported <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and I spent hour
                            and half with him yesterday morning. Highlights of this conversation
                            follow:</p>
                        <p>1. Regardless of how Malaysian dispute develops, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is concerned with
                            preservation long range relationship with US Govt. To that end, he
                            considers it vital for US to maintain some continuing link with Indo
                            army. He recognizes current strains in relationships but armed forces
                            are strongly pro-US and anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. It is
                            of vital importance to US and to Indonesia that certain programs in
                            support of armed forces continue. Appreciating political limitations we
                            face, he said training of military officers in US and civic action
                            program in Indonesia must continue as investment in future. He felt so
                            strongly about this he asked me if I could arrange to send a personal
                            message from him to Secy <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>, Gen Maxwell Taylor and <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName>. I said I would be glad to do so and will
                            transmit message as soon as received.</p>
                        <p>2. I explained difficulties which faced US in continuing aid to Indonesia
                            and spelled out implications of amendments to aid bill. I pointed out
                            that if Indo army continues to be involved in sponsoring “aggression” in
                            Borneo, it would be next to impossible for US to help, even though we
                            too were concerned about long range relationships.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> felt that no real
                            solution to Malaysia dispute was possible within immediate future
                            because of hard positions on both sides. He wants talks to continue
                            because there is always hope that solution will be found but he is not
                            optimistic. He understands <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s position (“I have never criticized the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> even though I disagree with him,”
                            he pointed out) and his political problems. He also indicated frankly
                            that in his view <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            needed to continue confrontation policy in order to induce his people to
                            accept hardships of current economic situation. To this I retorted that
                            way to solve economic situation was to end confrontation—economic
                            situation did not have to be “accepted.”</p>
                        <p>4. Expanding on his reasons for pessimism over likelihood of settlement,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was still holding to
                            position that, pursuant <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0119"/>to
                            agreement reached in Manila, some form of plebiscite or referendum must
                            be held to confirm public opinion in Sarawak and Sabah favored joining
                            Malaysia. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> did not
                            think, even after April election that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> would consider this. Therefore, he expected talks
                            to break down, cease fire to break down. If this happened, he would do
                            his utmost to prevent escalation of struggle and believed it could be
                            kept within confines of small guerrilla action. He said he still had
                            officer friends in Malaysian army with whom he was in quiet
                            communication and that they too were anxious to avoid open conflict. I
                            pointed out seriousness of Indo position internationally if “aggression”
                            in form of insertion new guerrillas into Borneo continued, also
                            inconsistency in his expecting US to support Indo army in any way when
                            same army was responsible for these actions. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> took me up on word
                            “responsible.” He said his govt was responsible for whatever decisions
                            might be made, that army was forced to carry out decisions of govt. He
                            appeared to be saying that time would come when situation might be
                            different and meanwhile it was vital to our mutual interests not to
                            destroy confidence and communication which presently existed between
                            Indo army, particularly, and US army.</p>
                        <p>5. As to resolution of impasse over Malaysia <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> thought political changes in either Kuala
                            Lumpur or Djakarta might be required before real solution to Malaysian
                            dispute would be possible. He added caveat which I did not ask him to
                            explain “unless God intervenes.”</p>
                        <p>6. In response my question as to how much control Indo army actually had
                            over guerrillas, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            replied, “Complete control over Indo volunteers” but probably very
                            little control over remainder.</p>
                        <p>7. I asked <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> whether army
                            would take action against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> if party
                            attempted exploit current economic difficulties through strikes, riots,
                            etc. He said <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was still supporting
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and would not go
                            so far as to adopt tactics directed at <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. If <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> did,
                            however, Madiun (1948 crushing of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            attempted coup) would be mild compared with army crackdown today. He
                            said <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had personally
                            ordered <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> recently to stop aggravating
                            economic difficulties and food situation by exploiting it for propaganda
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>8. What about <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in important executive
                            posts in cabinet, I asked in recent meeting. Following <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> report on seriousness of economic and
                            food situation, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had offered
                            cabinet post to anyone who would guarantee to solve problems. There were
                            no takers. Army was still against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in
                            executive cabinet, he said. But important thing was not formal structure
                            of cabinet. Thus Justice Min and Education Min were leftists if not
                            actually <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> members, but neither were
                            in small power group which made decisions. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> implied <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s continuing tactic was to subordinate <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in ways which resulted in dilution
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence in conduct of
                            govt.</p>
                        <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0120"/>
                        <p>9. Situation in Sarawak and Sabah, according to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, could be summarized about as
                            follows: There were 1,000 trained guerrillas in area of which one-third
                            were native to area, one-third were youth volunteers from Indo army and
                            veterans. These men were trained to expand their influence so that
                            presumably six to ten times their number could be counted upon.<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                                estimated that there were 400–500 Indonesian reinforcements on the
                                Malaysian Borneo border ready to cross into Malaysia at any time.
                                They estimated that there were 800–870 guerrillas in Borneo and
                                1,600 Indonesian guerrillas committed to confrontation with
                                Malaysia. (Memorandum from McCafferty to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, March 11; Johnson Library, National

                            and half talk with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            alone this morning, at least half of time being devoted to discussion of
                            problems connected with possibility of peaceful settlement of Malaysia
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>Despite absence of <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            who was tied up with preparatory <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>
                            conference, I decided to make all points in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> as I concluded I would not have another opportunity
                            until after <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> conference. In <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0121"/>doing so, however, I told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> I hoped that he and I and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> could hold
                            meeting together in near future to clarify issues in connection this

                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> denied flatly that
                            Indos had changed their position since March 17 understanding had been
                            reached (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1920 to Dept)<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">See <ref target="#d39fn2">footnote 2, Document

                            talks at Ambassadorial instead Min level. In all other respects he
                            reconfirmed position as reported <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>—indeed I read him excerpt from <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> which he confirmed as
                            representing his attitude. He had reconsidered question of Ambassadorial
                            talks he said because he was convinced they would not get anywhere and
                            he preferred Ministerial talks, although he repeated he was quite
                            prepared to enter summit talks without preparatory talks. I pointed out
                            difficulties of this in view of fact that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> could not be expected to enter summit talks unless
                            guerrillas had been withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>I felt Ministerial talks would be necessary to accomplish dual purpose of
                            withdrawal of guerrillas and achieving progress toward political formula
                            for settlement. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            indicated he was agreeable to this, “We have not shifted our position,”
                            he repeated.</p>
                        <p>During course of discussion I bore down heavily on Yani's public
                            statement that cease fire means legalization guerrilla pockets and of
                            Indo moves to reinforce Borneo guerrillas and mount terrorist campaign
                            in mainland Malaysia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            denied flatly that Yani's statement meant what I implied. He said it was
                            simply a matter of semantics and not intention to distort cease fire
                            understanding reached with Attorney General. It was he said simply
                            another way of saying “stand- fast.” He then repeated what he understood
                            cease fire to mean: (1) no shooting; (2) standfast; (3) no mopping up;
                            (4) no withdrawal. He admitted cease fire had been only partially
                            successful, then accused British troops of “bestiality, not merely
                            atrocity” in decapitating captured guerrilla by putting rope around his
                            neck attached to a helicopter.</p>
                        <p>My comment on terrorist campaign in mainland drew fire. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> denied these were Indo
                            guerrillas, said I must remember there were many Malays on mainland
                            whose sympathies did not lie with Malaysia. Then accused
                            British-Malaysians of planning bombings and ambush in south Sulawesi.
                            When I pressed him for evidence, he said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had this week arrested two Malaysians in Djakarta who
                            confessed. He assured me with some heat that foreign support of recent
                            troubles in Sulawesi had been established.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to peaceful settlement of Malaysia dispute, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he could not
                            understand why everybody seemed to think that it was so difficult a
                            problem. “The whole mess can be cleared up by one <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0122"/>simple act” he said—then referred in
                            general terms to some method of implementing Manila agreement by
                            ascertainment of public opinion in Kalimantan. “My position is clear”
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said, “I prefer
                            Sarawak and Sabah as free nations to join other free nations within
                            framework of Maphilindo” but he insisted “if they stick to Malaysia, if
                            Kalimantan people prefer to join Malaysia, I will also recognize
                            Malaysia.” He then repeated earlier statement that said he had felt
                            “insulted and humiliated” over establishment of Malaysia on Sept 16
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> survey had been completed.
                            This was “real tearing up of Manila agreement” he said hotly.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on the Washington-Bangkok feeling that Indos had shifted
                            their position, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            revealed that Gen Yani had had frank talk with Thai General who was here
                            to discuss sending observers to Kalimantan and had outlined Indo
                            position as I had reported it.</p>
                        <p>At another point, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            revealed his intention to wage vigorous campaign to get second <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> conference to condemn Malaysia. I pointed
                            out conference was long way off, probably would not be held until next
                            fall—did he mean he had no intention to reach political settlement in
                            interim? “Tell the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to put a
                            little water in the wine,” he said in indicating clearly that he did
                            want a settlement but that as <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had put it, <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> should “sweeten the pill.”</p>

                        <p>As Department sees it, present situation approximately as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Indonesia: Re immediate situation, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> apparently either (a) believes that he has made
                            offer to Malaysians which should permit resumption negotiations and that
                            ball now in <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s court, or (b)
                            has done no such thing but wants us think he has. Thus he has just
                            reiterated to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>
                            his acceptance <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula
                            along lines he agreed to on March 17 and has ended his April 13 speech
                            with call for <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> reply to his
                            remarks. Discrepancy between his comments and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s hard line in Bangkok
                            (Bangkok's 1718)<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">In telegram 1718 from
                                Bangkok, April 8, the Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, after an extended
                                conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, was convinced that the Indonesians were
                                not prepared to withdraw prior to political talks or a summit; there
                                was no chance of progress until after the elections in Malaysia; and
                                the Indonesians were not going to be pinned down as to
                                interpretations of the <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName>
                                formula. (Ibid., Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 3 MAPHILINDO)</note> still unexplained. Basic fact
                            is that he has not communicated acceptance to <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In wider context, direction <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> now heading particularly hard to fathom, perhaps
                            because it reflects uncertainty among Indos themselves. As far as
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has coherent
                            policy, would seem be along lines suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1093 to Djakarta,<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d41fn2">footnote 2, Document 41</ref>.</note>
                            i.e. stepped up military and subversive pressure to force early
                            unconditional summit. Still open question what he hopes get from summit,
                            although his comments to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> (Djakarta's 2119)<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5">
                                <ref target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note> indicate he still
                            pushing plebiscite, possibly as “face-saver” but possibly also to permit
                            further disruptive tactics in Borneo.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, all indications are that Indo economy heading toward severe
                            crisis by next fall which could seriously shake even <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime, hitherto immune to
                            internal economic pressures.</p>
                        <p>2. Malaysia: All parties to dispute seem to agree no real progress toward
                            settlement possible prior April 25 elections. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s energetic defiance Indonesia,
                            while understandable, not making things any easier. Even after elections
                            little chance Malaysians will be prepared to budge on principle of no
                            negotiations until guerrillas start withdrawing and no summit until they
                            substantially withdrawn. They see nothing to convince them that Indos
                            not bent on implementation “crush Malaysia” policy and are reacting
                            accordingly. Presumably they deriving comfort from obvious plight Indo
                            economy and latest reports Sulawesi dissidence, which they take as
                            strengthening their hopes for removal Indo threat by breakup of
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>On military side, stepped up Indo guerrilla and terrorist activity is
                            building up pressure for active British-Malaysian retaliation despite
                            damage this could do to Malaysian position before world.</p>
                        <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0124"/>
                        <p>3. Philippines: Since his trip to Indonesia and in atmosphere of
                            increasing domestic criticism for following in wake of Indos, Macapagal
                            has made tangible moves to bring Phil position onto more truly middle
                            ground between prime disputants, establishing space between himself and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s hard line.
                            While this has had no apparent restraining influence on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, it has served to improve
                            somewhat <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> relations with Malaysia.
                            Basically, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> has kept Phil
                            policy in harmony with U.S. approach to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and will be watching for any changes in this
                            respect on our part.</p>
                        <p>4. United States: Tactics we have used to date—quiet pressure on all
                            sides toward moderation, encouraging negotiations within “Asian”
                            context, continuing but limiting aid to Indo, refraining from taking
                            sides openly despite overwhelming U.S. public sympathy for Malaysia—may
                            have prevented more serious blowup but have not yet brought settlement
                            within sight. Our current efforts revolve around <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula which, despite
                            ambiguities, is only proposal now afloat that promises channel for
                            resumption direct negotiations. Time available to us for generating
                            progress toward settlement, however, is running out. With fiscal year
                            nearing end, Presidential Determination cannot long be withheld. Unless
                            Indos stop escalating guerrilla activities and resume negotiations, will
                            be almost impossible expect decision favorable to Indo.</p>
                        <p>With foregoing analysis in mind, would be most helpful to Department if
                            Ambassadors could examine situation both from immediate tactical
                            viewpoint and in wider context broad U.S. policy.<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6">See <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note> We
                            must of course take British interests and current intentions into
                            account. Among questions in former category which you might consider are
                            following (list is by no means all-inclusive):</p>
                        <p>1. Current efforts to revive negotiations: Does <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula still hold any real
                            promise in getting negotiations resumed? If so, how can we encourage its
                            implementation? If not, are there any alternative ways of getting
                            parties together? Is this desirable objective prior elections or should
                            we sit it out until after April 25?</p>
                        <p>2. Observers: We continue think it highly desirable get Thai observers
                            deployed soonest. Do Ambassadors agree? What are present prospects
                            getting Thai observers moving, and is there anything we can do speed
                            process? If we must write off Thai observers, are there any other ways
                            by which neutral entities can be placed in position to police ceasefire
                            and build up record Indo violations for possible later use?</p>
                        <p>3. Phil-Malaysian relations: How can we speed up lagging process of
                            establishing consular relations?</p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>4. Military situation: What is most likely Indo objective in stepping up
                            guerrilla incursions and mainland terrorism, and how much farther do
                            they intend go? How close are British and Malaysians to decision on
                            border-crossing retaliation? How effective are contemplated retaliatory
                            measures likely to be and what would be Indo reaction? Assuming
                            retaliation undesirable, what alternatives have British and Malaysians
                            to discourage Indo buildup? Do we have any remaining leverage that might
                            get Indos to taper off, and if so, how do we apply it?</p>
                        <p>5. Internal dissidence in Sulawesi: How serious is it and how much will
                            it limit Indo escalation military confrontation? Any chance it spreading
                            other areas? Any indications outside encouragement and support for
                            dissidents?</p>
                        <p>6. Political settlement: Assuming (a) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> must have some sort “pill-sweetener” and (b)
                            Malaysians cannot accept formal Borneo plebiscite or similar arrangement
                            which would cast their sovereignty or prestige in doubt, is there some
                            middle ground where both could meet if they were brought together? What
                            appear to be rock-bottom Indo conditions for settlement? What are
                            maximum conditions Malaysians could be expected accept?</p>
                        <p>In addition foregoing tactical questions, we are suggesting Ambassadors
                            also take wider look at current U.S. strategy. You should consider, for
                            example, whether our present policy of active but indirect and
                            relatively disinterested involvement should be continued or whether
                            alternative might better meet our interests. Among possible alternatives
                            are (a) disengagement, tapering off our mediatory efforts, attempting
                            maintain minimum foothold in Indo, and waiting for economic attrition to
                            bring <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to knees; (b)
                            increasing scope of our mediatory efforts, calling plays from
                            quarterback slot rather than sidelines; (c) expending our remaining
                            leverage on all-out effort deflect <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, recognizing that we are out of Indonesia if we
                            fail. This by no means inclusive list. Others, or mix of several, may
                            occur to you. For example, you might consider possibility of encouraging
                            larger role in Indonesia by other countries such as Dutch.</p>

                                15.</note> evening attended by Asst. Secy.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and for a time by Secretary, and second
                            on Thursday morning. Greatly appreciated having ref <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> which gave central focus to
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>Following is summary of talks as they related to six questions set forth
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. This not cleared by all
                            participants and they may wish forward comments. Statements attributed
                            to Secretary uncleared by him.</p>
                        <p>1. Ambs concluded they really don't know at present whether <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula still holds any real
                            promise in getting negotiations resumed. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has said he would begin
                            withdrawal his troops with beginning political talks and would continue
                            withdrawal in conformity progress of such talks. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said Malaysians have had no
                            official notification of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position.
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> plans ask <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at meeting scheduled for
                            April 21 whether his March 17 position still stands and if so urge
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to inform
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> through Thais. Said
                            would be helpful if he could tell <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> still prepared accept <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> interpretation of <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> had been prepared accept it on March 18 and
                            probably still prepared do so. Outcome <persName>Jones</persName>
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on 21st
                            should give some indication whether <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> formula can be useful.</p>
                        <p>Prospect for Ministerial meeting seems dim. Best bet probably to try for
                            summit. President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> thinks
                            there some chance for summit meeting after April 25 elections in
                            Malaysia. He regards this as last chance. Appears have some reasons, not
                            fully revealed to us, for believing he can bring it about. Ambs agreed
                            that we should sit it out until after April 25.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambs not at all sure it continues be highly desirable get Thai
                            observers deployed soonest because: (1) Malaysians and Indonesians have
                            failed agree on any clear terms of reference for the observers; (2) as a
                            result Thais are fed up with the idea of their prospective observer <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0127"/>role and apprehensive their
                            friendly relationship with parties concerned could become prejudiced or
                            misunderstood; (3) if Brits are contemplating step-up of their actions
                            to include possible hot pursuit, Thais could be placed in embarrassing
                            position should Indos call upon observers to investigate a British
                            action. One reason for pushing observer idea is to build up evidence
                            against Indos for possible use in case issue brought to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Observer citations against Brits would
                            work against us. Moreover, we reluctant have issue brought into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because desire avoid getting into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter Article 19 matter.</p>
                        <p>Ambs concluded that while we might be able pressure Thais into taking up
                            observer role, it not worth the political cost in terms our relations
                            with Thais, unless some clearcut advantage to be gained, which doubtful.
                            Ambs thought careful consideration should be given to questions of what
                            would be responsibilities of observers, and what would result from
                            observer system if Brits step up level their activities.</p>
                        <p>Only possible alternative to Thai observers appeared be Japanese, who
                            have been anxious to play constructive role; but Ambs believe Japanese
                            involvement inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambs reviewed current status of process establishing consular
                            relations between Malaysians and Phils. Agreed Phils wanted to have
                            Consul General level in order carry on diplomatic communications through
                            consular relations, whereas Malaysians desire limit consuls to purely
                            consular functions in order keep pressure on Phils establish normal
                            diplomatic relations. Ambs have no specific recommendation how to speed
                            up process establishing consular relations. Believe we should stand
                            aside and problem will be resolved bilaterally.</p>
                        <p>4. Re Military Situation. Agreed there certainly is a build-up on
                            Indonesian side of border which is alarming. Some of the Indo regulars
                            are in on Malaysian side. Indos can keep this up indefinitely, and have
                            capability step up considerably. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> said he thought <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> genuinely wants some kind of settlement and that
                            he does not want to exacerbate already deteriorating relations with U.S.
                            Indonesian intention probably is to put maximum pressure on Malaysians
                            to obtain a face-saving formula for settlement, after which military
                            actions could be terminated and Indos would thereafter pursue their
                            policies in the political domain. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has said Indo objectives re Malaysia are
                            long-term proposition. Regards Malaysia as unnatural structure which
                            will ultimately collapse; but once a settlement of some kind reached,
                            the military phase presumably would be finished at least for time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>Malaysians and Australians consider very important that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> not gain benefits from
                            aggressive action. They do not believe Indos will step up the level of
                            their action much, even though they unable achieve benefits they
                            contemplate. British view is that Indos should be given “bloody nose.”
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> said Indo military
                            leaders had told <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0128"/>him they would
                            do everything possible to avoid escalation. However, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> thought Indos would react pretty
                            violently to attacks into Indo territory.</p>
                        <p>British fear situation approaching point where Communist Chinese cadres
                            will begin coming into Malaysia and taking over guerrilla operations.
                            Perhaps British would like to see military situation escalate to point
                            where would have war and <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>
                            commitments could be invoked and burden thus passed to U.S.</p>
                        <p>Ambs outlined two related conceptions of way British say they see
                            military problem. At border there are a number of main access trails.
                            Guerrillas crossing from Indonesia must use these. Once across into
                            Sarawak, the trails fairly quickly begin to bifurcate and branch out.
                            Therefore essential stop guerrillas as they come across and before they
                            get into belt where trails branch out and enable guerrillas to melt into
                            countryside. Other version is that on Indonesian side there are number
                            of military groups. They have good lateral communications. These groups
                            can carry out feints at various points, while infiltrating group is
                            pushed across elsewhere. What is required, Brits reason, is to break up
                            these bilateral communications, or attack concentrations on Indo side.
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> said if Brits did
                            that, it would probably mean real war.</p>
                        <p>5. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> convinced British are
                            involved in Sulawesi insurrection. No hard evidence of this, but there
                            has been some recent increase in intensity of uprisings there and some
                            rather sophisticated weapons being used.</p>
                        <p>6. Re political settlement, collective view was that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may well be seeking some
                            kind of face-saving settlement. “Pill sweetener” would probably have to
                            be some kind of ascertainment formula. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has said Indos want a plebiscite. Know they
                            won't win, but this would give them something. Question arose as to why,
                            if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> really wants a
                            political settlement he continues support volunteers and <gloss target="#t_CCO1">CCO</gloss> and putting in regulars. Answer may be
                            that this is pressure to get a settlement. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> fears that if he pulls
                            these out, Malaysians would say there is nothing more to talk about.</p>
                        <p>On Malaysian side, question is what could they give.</p>
                        <p>British have been against <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s
                            trying for political settlement, because they don't think there is
                            anything he could give. British think he might nonetheless give away his
                            shirt if he went to a summit. It is possible that after elections, if
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> had won by healthy
                            margin, he might feel in strong enough position domestically to give
                            something, perhaps ascertainment. However, a wide margin of victory in
                            elections might have just opposite effect on <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>, and increased <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and Australian military support might also be a factor.</p>
                        <p>Ambs concluded that important thing was to get resumption of
                            negotiations, presumably at a summit meeting in Tokyo after Malaysian
                                <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0129"/>elections. Question of just
                            what formula might possibly emerge was one which the three Asian nations
                            would have to figure out. Secretary, who was present during discussion
                            of this point, agreed. Observed that Asians might ultimately agree on a
                            “pill sweetener” which to U.S. would look more like a pickle. Secretary
                            said he thought we ought to stay out of this until end of month and see
                            how it goes.</p>
                        <p>In taking a wider look at current U.S. strategy, Ambs indicated no
                            patience with Indonesian position. However, if Indos really are looking
                            for a face-saving device to end military actions and would plan confine
                            themselves to working out their objectives politically over long term,
                            then we should continue our efforts to channel course of events so that
                            Indos will have no other choice but to adhere to some kind of peaceful
                            formula.</p>
                        <p>Best chance, perhaps last chance, lies in <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s effort to get a summit at Tokyo after April
                            25; and this is something we may have to leave pretty much to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> to bring off. We should stay
                            on sidelines and not try to call plays from quarterback slot.</p>
                        <p>To achieve settlement, it necessary for Malaysians to agree to some kind
                            of formula. Malaysians take position that it must be demonstrated to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that he can't
                            gain advantage from show of force. Question is, who is going to
                            demonstrate it? U.S. not interested in getting into this. Have hands
                            full in South Vietnam, etc. Secretary observed during first meeting that
                            he had told <persName corresp="#p_BSGEJ1">Barwick</persName> we not
                            going to put in boys from Nebraska and Kansas just because <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> won't go to a meeting. Extremely
                            important that British do not initiate any cross-border actions at this
                            time which would ruin chances for summit. They should continue exercise
                            restraint little while longer until clearly apparent there is no hope of
                            summit and settlement.</p>

                        <p>We see number of risks in early summit, particularly in absence any real
                            indications grounds for settlement exist (see separate telegram this
                            subject). If any such grounds exist we inclined favor summit, since (a)
                            as shown during Manila summit last summer, principals can display
                            unexpected flexibility on occasion and (b) summit would at least provide
                            conclusive test <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            intentions.</p>

                            direct role in promoting summit, as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has requested we do (Djakarta's 2225).<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Dated April 22. (National Archives and Records

                            eager for summit by promoting it directly. Rather than play this sort of
                            game, we believe our role should be limited to encouraging principals
                            themselves to take necessary initiative.</p>
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s case, we think
                            best tactic at this point would be to dispel any illusion that he can
                            engineer summit painlessly by having us do work for him. This could
                            bring him face to face with hard decision as to how much he prepared pay
                            for summit, with world tour plans adding to his sense of urgency.</p>
                        <p>For Djakarta: Ambassador should see <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, preferably in presence Subandrio, and draw on
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Department has considered his request <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> explore possibility convening summit meeting and has
                            decided we not in position do so. This decision based on number factors,
                            including our continuing conviction Asians themselves must take
                            initiative in solving their problems (as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself constantly proclaims in public). We
                            somewhat surprised, in fact, that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would ask us become involved in view prolonged
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-encouraged anti-US campaign
                            throughout Indo, in which alleged US interference Indo affairs has been
                            constant theme.</p>
                        <p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> truly interested
                            in resuming negotiations, we urge him consider following: Major obstacle
                            to progress in negotiations to date has been consistent Indo failure put
                            forth concrete proposals or even make clear to others what they want. As
                            one example, Subandrio April 7 offered provide Thanat with specific
                            examples of what <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> meant by
                            “pill-sweeteners” but to date we understand Thanat has received nothing.
                            Same evasiveness and lack frankness apparent in Indo reaction to Lopez
                            formula. If Sukarno now wishes determine <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0133"/>Malaysian attitude to summit, he would lose nothing and
                            gain respect by sounding out <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> openly,
                            either through regularly established channel which both he and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> have accepted, i.e., Thanat, or
                            alternately through <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>, of course, is repeatedly
                            on record that he will not attend summit while pistol pointed at head.
                            Should not be unexpected if he now insists that guerrillas be out of
                            Malaysia before agreeing to summit. Only way find out, however, is to
                            make direct offer or inquiry.</p>
                        <p>4. Whatever <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s decision in
                            matter, we would not consider urging him show greater flexibility on
                            guerrilla question. As <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> aware, we have consistently maintained that
                            continued presence guerrillas on Malaysian soil not only inexcusable on
                            legal-moral grounds but entirely contrary Indo's own interests. So far
                            these guerrillas have seriously tarnished Indo image before world;
                            poisoned <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> friendship with US,
                            Australia and other countries; cost Indo substantial foreign aid; helped
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> win elections; and
                            insured indefinite continuance British forces in area. Other side of
                            ledger empty. As <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            should realize, Malaysia is stronger, not weaker, than before
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>5. Assuming <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will
                            initiate new contacts with Malaysians, we hope he will be realistically
                            aware of extent to which April 25 election has strengthened <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s position. No question that Indo
                            confrontation was great help to <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>. He ran on strong anti-Indo platform and Malaysian
                            electorate overwhelmingly endorsed him. Any Indo attempt to assert that
                            victory resulted from British intimidation certain to fall flat before
                            world and damage Indo credibility, since election carried out in full

                        <p>For Kuala Lumpur: Whether there will be summit or other meetings depends

                            but attempt convince him that he should regard his new political

                            the President said the volunteers had been instructed to mass outside

                            Asian affairs are blamed for the continual trouble in the Far East. Said
                            foreign countries, especially the United States, oppose him, and cited
                            as proof the fact that American magazine, Whisper, printed a picture of

                            the only question is how gradually we disengage, I think. We've still
                            got that problem of that determination, hanging over us on that

                            we stood on Malaysia issue, U.S.-Indo relations, aid to Indonesia,
                            anti-American campaign and internal economic situation brought forth
                            following major points:</p>
                        <p>1. Cancellation of U.S. Aid and U.S.-Indo Relations. After we had
                            discussed new Philippine initiative re Malaysia, reported below,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said he
                            wished to direct attention to whole question of relations between our
                            two countries which he felt were approaching a new all time low. He
                            referred to <persName>Bundy</persName>'s threat to withdraw U.S. aid
                            unless Indonesia changed its policy on Malaysia,<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> made this
                                statement in a speech on May 5 to the Conference of the Advertising
                                Council in Washington, and the speech was reported in The New York
                                Times. <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that although the United
                                States would like to help Indonesia economically, it was not able to
                                do so. He continued, “We have been forced to cut back our aid
                                programs very sharply and we may have to eliminate them entirely if
                                Indonesia should continue a policy called confrontation against
                                Malaysia—if it continues or is enlarged—to something that could only
                                be characterized as aggression. That must be met.”
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>'s full remarks relating to Indonesia
                                are in telegram 1193 to Djakarta, May 5. (Ibid.) In a memorandum to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, May 8,

                            this, suggested that perhaps in interest of both parties most

                            accept any American assistance. This would relieve U.S. as well as
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of irritant. His govt was being
                            embarrassed by repeated U.S. official public statements designed to
                            bring pressure on Indonesia. I was fully aware, he noted, of how
                            sensitive Indonesians were on subject of being told what to do. If aid
                            programs could not survive unless <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            changed its policy, perhaps best thing would be to cut it off now;
                            relations between our two countries might be more harmonious without
                            present small aid program than with it.</p>

                            had been anticipating something of this sort and had tried to head it
                            off by series of moves yesterday afternoon and last night. Moves did not
                            go unnoticed; indeed <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> referred to Yani's inquiry.) I responded by
                            saying that, as I had repeatedly made clear, I recognized that time
                            might come when our aid program to Indonesia must come to a halt.
                            However, I felt that now was not the time. I pointed out patience of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in this matter in face of
                            growing Congressional pressures and public opinion in U.S., and
                            endeavored to convince them that <persName>Bundy</persName> statement
                            was not to be interpreted as a threat but merely factual statement of
                            situation which we faced. I said it would seem bad timing for either of
                            us to cancel U.S. aid program on threshold of new Philippine initiative
                            which might remove some of the difficulties we now faced. If we had any
                            hope of summit meeting and peaceful settlement of Malaysian dispute,
                            surely it was in Indo's interest to await outcome of these efforts. For
                            our part, we were not contemplating any sudden step of this kind (I
                            trust I was correct) because we sincerely desired peaceful settlement of
                            dispute by Asian nations concerned and we had no intention of
                            introducing new element which might add to current friction between
                            us.</p>

                                <persName>Bundy</persName> statement and asked me direct question as
                            to whether it represented, as they had concluded, major change of
                            direction in U.S. policy. Bundy was new appointee, this was his first
                            public statement, it had more than ordinary significance. People were
                            saying it represented a new and harder line against Indonesia on part of
                            new administration in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> added that some of his Embassy people in

                            I had said same thing time and time again. It turned out it was not so
                            much substance of <persName>Bundy</persName> remarks to which Indos
                            objected as fact that they were made publicly. They hoisted me on my own
                            petard <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0137"/>by suggesting desirability
                            of keeping comments of this sort in diplomatic channels. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> referred to
                            considerable improvement in Indo-Australian relations in past couple of
                            weeks as result of fact that case was no longer being tried in
                            newspapers. “This is a very difficult period for us,” he said. “If we
                            want to help U.S.-Indo relations on present level of friendship, it will
                            help very much if your people will not make public threats against
                            us.”</p>
                        <p>I said I would relay this message to Washington but that there were two
                            sides to this, and suggested anti-American campaign here might be tamped
                            down. But in final analysis I thought best hope for improvement in
                            relations lay in possibility of peaceful settlement of Malaysia dispute.
                            So long as Indonesia appeared in role of aggressor, things would
                            continue difficult. Many people in U.S. and elsewhere were convinced
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was engaged in a
                            drive for territorial expansion and I suggested his actions had done
                            little to dispel this suspicion. If peaceful settlement of Malaysia
                            dispute were achieved as result of summit meeting, not only would
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s image improve
                            with this and accompanying withdrawal of his guerrillas but he would be
                            able to concentrate on his increasingly serious economic problem with
                            the possibility of renewed friendly assistance from outside world.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic Situation. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> used above as springboard to charge that
                            principal reason for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> economic
                            difficulties was failure of U.S. to fulfill its promises re balance of
                            payments assistance. I took grim satisfaction in demolishing this
                            accusation in Sukarno's presence for I am confident this was first time
                            he had ever heard full story. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> beat a hasty retreat after I had made clear
                            way in which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had cut its own throat
                            by trade blockade at critical moment in implementation of stabilization
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> then asked me what I
                            meant by “increasingly serious economic problem.” I outlined economic
                            situation as we see it in simplest terms. He asked me if people were
                            going hungry. I pointed out that so far as subsistence was concerned,
                            situation was temporarily better with harvest of new rice crop. But I
                            predicted that beginning October, Indonesia would face real economic and
                            financial crisis unless steps were taken.</p>
                        <p>“Do you mean collapse” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            asked. I told him I did not mean collapse because Indonesian economy was
                            resilient and not that sophisticated—but I did mean real trouble. I
                            outlined foreign exchange position of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, unsatisfactory exports, financial requirements for
                            spare parts and raw materials, debt service and rice and demonstrated
                            how <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could not possibly make ends
                            meet without outside assistance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said Indonesians
                            had tightened their belts before and could do so again and he added that
                            Pres <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not want to
                            borrow money from outside. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> looked black as a thundercloud <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0138"/>during this exchange. He may have been
                            angry with me or possibly as result sudden realization his people had
                            never painted so dark a picture and might have been misleading him.</p>
                        <p>3. Malaysia Dispute. I opened conversation after usual pleasantries by
                            reviewing U.S. position with respect to this subject, pointed out we
                            continued (a) to favor tripartite meeting ending in summit, (b) to
                            consider peaceful settlement vital to interests of all concerned as well
                            as free world, (c) to feel strongly that any settlement to be successful
                            must be reached by Asian nations concerned. Consequently, we welcomed
                            new Philippine initiative and hoped that it would achieve success. I
                            urged <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to make every effort to
                            help bring this initiative to successful conclusion and emphasized
                            importance of keeping discussion in diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>It appeared that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had
                            not been briefed by <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> re Lopez visit because ForMin picked up ball
                            at that point and explained to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> what I was talking about. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> seemed pleased by news but
                            immediately turned to me and asked whether I thought the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> would cooperate. He had had no
                            indication from anyone, certainly not from press, that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> would come to summit. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> continued to make anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> statements. I said I
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> would come to
                            summit, provided all parties gave appearance of being reasonable and
                            approaching meeting in spirit of good will. Withdrawal of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s guerrillas was an
                            important element in establishing latter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> again repeated his
                            position had not changed. It was up to <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said they looked forward to visit of Lopez as
                            special emissary from <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked whether
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> statement meant that U.S. was now
                            defending Malaysia. I said if he meant by this militarily defending
                            Malaysia, the answer of course was negative, although, I cautioned,
                            escalation of the conflict could result in <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> Treaty being invoked. If he meant politically
                            supporting Malaysia, he was aware that we recognized Malaysia and that
                            we had welcomed its formation. But if he meant were we openly taking
                            sides in Malaysia dispute, answer again was negative. <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> had made amply clear
                            that we considered solution of Malaysian dispute to be an Asian problem,
                            that we were keeping hands off in the sense of attempting to dictate a
                            formula, although we would do everything possible to help bring
                            disputants to conference table. We were prepared to accept any solution
                            upon which all parties to dispute agreed.</p>
                        <p>5. U.S. Press and Anti-American Campaign. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> complained again about treatment by American
                            press, said Soviet and Chinese press never did this to him, asked if
                            there was not something <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName>
                            could do to tone down anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> articles. I reminded him we have free press. I
                            noted Chinese and Soviet press 100 percent controlled. <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0139"/>He cited example of Adenauer who had
                            called in certain editors and asked them not to vilify <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, that they were hurting
                            relations with Indonesia. I said I would pass on his comments but best
                            remedy would be settlement of Malaysia dispute. I noted that I felt I
                            had more right to complain to him of treatment in Indonesia where press
                            was controlled, yet anti-American, anti-<persName>Jones</persName>
                            articles were being published daily. I was not convinced these did not
                            represent government policy or tactics. For example, I said, I was
                            certain that resolutions by numerous organizations declaring me persona
                            non grata would not have been passed and publicized without the specific
                            blessing of the Foreign Minister. So long as these statements solely
                            represented <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> opinion, I considered
                            them compliment. But if they had the blessing of the govt, this was
                            another matter. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            was somewhat taken aback. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> responded saying the day would never come when
                            such actions would represent the opinion of the government.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Conversation, as foregoing report
                            indicates, was full and frank, with occasional heated exchanges. I think
                            net result was probably constructive.</p>
                        <p>As for Indo cancellation of U.S. aid, I believe we have headed that off
                            for time being. I recommend that, so far as possible, we not exacerbate
                            situation by further public statements on subject of aid withdrawal.
                            Indos clearly recognize loss of aid as inevitable unless peaceful
                            settlement of Malaysia dispute is achieved but it would be far
                            preferable to let aid die natural death than to provoke Indos into
                            pulling a Prince Sihanouk. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> of course
                            is calling for this action and I urge that we not play into their
                            hands.</p>

                            supplemental paper covering last-minute developments will be submitted
                            later. This paper makes the following salient points:</p>
                        <p>Indonesian guerrilla activity in Malaysian Borneo is continuing, although
                            there has been a marked lull in recent weeks. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may be planning a
                            substantial step-up shortly, however, to force the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> into an early summit meeting on
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s terms.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s real intentions
                            are not clear, but there is a possibility he actually wants a peaceful
                            settlement. Both the Army and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            would probably oppose a settlement but it is unlikely that either could

                            it. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s terms for
                            settlement have not been spelled out but probably include, as a minimum,
                            some sort of pro-forma reascertainment of popular opinion toward
                            Malaysia in Sabah and Sarawak which he could claim as a victory for
                            internal consumption.</p>
                        <p>Internally Indonesia is in major difficulty. The economy is in bad shape
                            and continues to deteriorate. A regional revolt in Sulawesi is causing
                            additional strain. Neither, however, is likely to shake <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s hold on the country.</p>
                        <p>We have been exerting diplomatic and (through aid) economic pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to abandon
                            confrontation and work out a peaceful settlement. The most promising
                            current initiative has been taken by <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, who has contacted <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to urge an early summit meeting
                            of the three.</p>

                        <p>No change is recommended in U.S. aid policy. We should continue to
                            refrain from a formal Presidential Determination, at least until early
                            June.</p>

                        <p>Indonesia is currently pursuing a two-sided policy in its dispute with
                            Malaysia. On the one hand it is continuing its military, political and
                            economic confrontation against Malaysia with the proclaimed objective of
                            “crushing” the state. On the other hand <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is asserting both publicly and privately his
                            desire to settle the dispute peacefully.</p>
                        <p>Armed Indonesian-led guerrilla units are continuing their depredations in
                            Malaysian Borneo, and Indonesian terrorists are continuing to operate in
                            mainland Malaysia and Singapore. Estimates about a month ago showed some
                            4–600 Indonesian guerrillas in Malaysian Borneo and an indeterminate
                            number of terrorists on the mainland. On both fronts, however, there has
                            been a marked lull over the past few weeks. Reasons for the lull are
                            unclear. It could have been brought about by the increased effectiveness
                            of British-Malaysian countermeasures, by voluntary withdrawals for
                            regrouping preparatory to further assaults, by a change in Indonesian
                            tactics from hit-and-run moves to the establishment of permanent
                            guerrilla pockets in remote areas, by a combination of the foregoing,
                            or, conceivably, by an unadmitted change in Indonesian policy.</p>
                        <p>In the political field, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been pushing for an early summit meeting
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> without “preconditions” (i.e.,
                            the withdrawal of Indonesian guerrillas from Malaysian soil, which the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> has publicly insisted
                            on before sitting down with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>). He has, however, expressed his willingness to
                            begin voluntary withdrawals simultaneously with the convening of a
                            summit meeting or pre-summit ministerial meeting, obviously intending to
                            control the pace of withdrawals as a bargaining counter.</p>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>There have been some recent indications that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, despite the serious risks
                            involved, may be preparing for a substantial step-up in covert military
                            activities in the near future as a means of frightening the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> into agreeing to an early and
                            unconditional summit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indonesian Intentions </p>
                        <p>The sincerity of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            alleged desire for a peaceful settlement can be doubted but has not yet
                            been fully tested. Conceivably his professed willingness to negotiate is
                            no more than a blind behind which he is pursuing a calculated plan to
                            dismember Malaysia and pick up the pieces. The British incline toward
                            this estimate. We think it more likely, however, that—as far as
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself is
                            concerned—his main goal is less that of bringing about Malaysia's
                            downfall than that of avenging the fancied humiliation he suffered when
                            Malaysia was formed and scoring what he can claim as a major diplomatic
                            victory before the world.</p>
                        <p>The objectives of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s other civilian advisers seem to consist of
                            little more than getting <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> what he wants.</p>
                        <p>The Indonesian Army, however, appears to be genuinely obsessed with the
                            long-range Chinese threat it professes to see in Malaysia and to be
                            committed to a long, hard campaign to avert that threat by bringing
                            Malaysia under Indonesian hegemony. It is doubtful that the Army would
                            stand against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> if he
                            accepted a peaceful settlement, but it would probably accept the
                            settlement reluctantly and might even continue, independent of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, a low-level campaign of
                            subversion against Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>For entirely different reasons—basically a desire to bring about a
                            complete break with the West—the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is
                            totally committed to an anti-Malaysia policy, and will use all the
                            influence it can muster to block a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Settlement Terms </p>
                        <p>Assuming <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> honestly does
                            want a settlement, the shape of a settlement acceptable to him is not
                            clear—perhaps even to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            himself. He is on record as (a) wanting separate “independence” for
                            Sabah and Sarawak and for Singapore as well, (b) being willing to accept
                            Malaysia as now constituted if the people of Sabah and Sarawak really
                            want it, and (c) demanding the reascertainment in Sabah and Sarawak of
                            popular opinion toward Malaysia to replace what he claims to have been
                            the faulty <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ascertainment of September
                            1963.</p>
                        <p>Privately Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has indicated that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is willing to recognize
                            Malaysia as a fact if he can be given a “pill sweetener” to erase the
                            humiliation and permit him a victory for internal consumption. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has not, however,
                            spelled out what an <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0143"/>acceptable
                            pill-sweetener would be—presumably it would have to be a device offering
                            at least the form of, or substituting for, a reascertainment in
                            Malaysian Borneo.</p>
                        <p>It is entirely possible that a summit meeting would not produce a firm
                            agreement in concrete terms but would, at best, leave numerous ends
                            dangling. In this event, the test would continue to be the actions taken
                            by the parties, i.e., a reduction in guerrilla activity by the
                            Indonesians and some form of ascertainment in Borneo on the part of the
                            Malaysians.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Developments in Indonesia </p>
                        <p>Internally the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime
                            is in major difficulty on a number of fronts, although its manifold
                            problems have not yet reached the stage of seriously threatening its
                            hold on the country.</p>
                        <p>The economy continues to deteriorate. Industrial output is declining in
                            the face of severe shortages of imported parts and raw materials. Export
                            earnings, hit by the confrontation against Malaysia, are insufficient to
                            finance an adequate flow of imports, and the regime can no longer rely
                            on foreign aid to fill the gap. Servicing of the huge foreign debt load
                            may consume 40 percent or more of anticipated earnings, and defaulting
                            on payments reportedly is already beginning.</p>
                        <p>Unable to feed itself or to finance adequate food imports, the country
                            has suffered from severe food shortages in various areas over the past
                            few months, which, although temporarily relieved by the April–May rice
                            harvest, are expected to recur on a larger scale next fall. The regime
                            has done little to counteract this rapid deterioration beyond exhorting
                            the populace and introducing a few ineffective monetary measures.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is
                            notoriously indifferent to economics, there is no doubt that even he is
                            dimly aware of the country's plight, and may be worried at its political
                            implications. Other members of the hierarchy are clearly disturbed by
                            it. At the same time, there are no signs that popular discontent over
                            declining living standards has reached, or will soon reach, such
                            proportions as to constitute a real danger to the regime.</p>
                        <p>In the security field, the regime is plagued by a fairly widespread
                            regional revolt in Southwest Sulawesi and by a few scattered indications
                            of unrest elsewhere (such as a recent series of army desertions in
                            Sumatra). There is no evidence, however, that internal dissidence is
                            likely to spread significantly as long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> keeps both the Army and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> tied to his regime.</p>
                        <p>In the context of its anti-Malaysia policy, the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> government has permitted
                            and apparently sometimes abetted a fairly intense propaganda campaign
                            against the United States by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>,
                            left-wing nationalists <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0144"/>and the
                            controlled press. A form of creeping nationalization is slowly squeezing
                            British investment out of the country (with the major exception of
                            Shell), and an increasing volume of threats are being leveled at
                            American enterprises. On the other hand, despite signs of approaching
                            trouble over certain financial provisions in the 1963 contracts, the
                            foreign oil companies are currently enjoying generally satisfactory
                            treatment by the government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">United States Position </p>
                        <p>We have made entirely clear to the Indonesians our lack of sympathy with
                            their anti-Malaysia policy and our opposition to their use of force in
                            pursuing that policy. The appreciable but limited leverage we have in
                            Indonesia has been brought to bear on the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> government in a continuing
                            attempt to induce an abandonment of confrontation and the negotiation of
                            a peaceful settlement. We have not tried to suggest the form such a
                            settlement should take (although we have indirectly floated a few
                            proposals) but have stressed to all parties that the formula for
                            settling this Asian dispute must come from the Asians themselves.</p>
                        <p>Our pressure on the Indonesians has been exerted directly, both in the
                            form of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>'
                            continuing dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and through such wider efforts as the Attorney
                            General's mission, Presidential messages, etc. It has been exerted
                            indirectly by the progressive scaling down of our economic and military
                            aid, which has contributed to the economic strain felt by the regime and
                            has served graphically to demonstrate the growing estrangement that
                            Indonesia's policies are forcing on us.</p>
                        <p>The success of our tactics has been mixed. We have not succeeded in
                            ending confrontation, and we have brought about a heightening of the
                            regime's anti-American orientation. Growing isolation from the United
                            States has probably contributed somewhat to closer Indonesian ties with
                            Communist China, although—significantly—not with the Soviet Union. On
                            the other hand, our efforts have probably been the main contributing
                            factor in bringing about such negotiations as have taken place and in
                            keeping the door open for further negotiation. In addition, our efforts
                            have probably been an important element in restraining the Indonesians

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> is continuing to
                            press our views on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at
                            every opportunity. His current efforts are directed particularly at
                            inducing the Indonesians (a) to enter into communications with the
                            Malaysians through Thai diplomatic channels rather than relying on
                            provocative public speeches to convey offers of resumed negotiations,
                            and (b) to spell out for the other principals what they mean by
                            “pill-sweeteners” <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0145"/>rather than
                            reiterating vague demands for reascertainment.</p>
                        <p>We are also encouraging <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            in his current effort to get negotiations restarted and have instructed
                            Ambassador Martin to hold a thoroughgoing exchange with Thai Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, with the idea of
                            getting him ready to resume an active mediatory role if <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s efforts succeed. As an
                            alternative should these moves fail, we have asked our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission to sound out U Thanat on the
                            possibility of his taking a more active part in the dispute if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Chaerul Saleh, Third Deputy Prime Minister and one of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s more influential
                            advisers, is scheduled to visit Washington briefly during the period May
                            18–20. This will give us a further opportunity to present our views, and
                            we intend to do so forcefully.</p>
                        <p>In the aid field, we have been bringing home to Nasution and the Army the
                            fact that Indonesia's confrontation policy unavoidably affects our
                            relations with the military as well as the civilian government, and
                            disabusing them of the hope that close Indonesian Army ties with the
                            Pentagon can be retained despite the cooling of other
                            government-to-government relations. Continuing limited military,
                            economic and technical aid is being kept under constant review to
                            maintain psychological pressure on the regime and to insure that it adds
                            nothing to Indonesia's confrontation capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In connection with our aid strategy, the question arises of the
                            Presidential Determination called for by Section 620(j) of the Foreign
                            Assistance Act. We are continuing to operate in Indonesia under a
                            Presidential decision that the Determination be withheld pending the
                            outcome of negotiations which would give us a clearer picture of
                            Indonesia's intentions. Our programs are being carried on under a
                            decision by the Attorney General that the President has a reasonable
                            length of time in which to analyze the situation and frame his
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>It may, however, be difficult to maintain this position to the end of the
                            fiscal year, and we may well have to bring this matter to the President
                            by early June.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Third Country Activities</p>
                        <p>The Philippines: Until the past few months the Philippine role in the
                            dispute was not a helpful one. Inhibited by their own claim in Sabah,
                            wary of offending their huge Indonesian neighbor and anxious to display
                            a more “Asian” image, the Philippines were less of an independent third
                            party to the dispute than a less-virulent junior partner of the
                            Indonesians. This position has changed substantially since last
                            February, however, as <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            has become increasingly disenchanted with Indonesia's rashness and
                            intransigence. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> has begun
                            a rapprochement with Malaysia by moving to re-establish consular <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0146"/>relations on May 18, and has
                            told us that he will make one last all-out effort to bring about a
                            peaceful settlement—failing which, he presumably will be prepared to
                            part company with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> has already started this
                            effort by sending messages to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the Tunku proposing an early summit to be
                            accompanied by guerrilla withdrawals. He intends to follow this up by
                            sending former Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> to both capitals during the week of May 10. The
                            substance of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s proposals
                            has not yet been fully spelled out, but among the measures he reportedly
                            is considering is that of mediation by outside Asian powers.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> has already responded
                            favorably to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s
                            initiative. In a May 9 letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> thanking him for a congratulatory message on the
                            outcome of the recent elections, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> stated that he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s terms for reopening talks
                            but “with a slight change, i.e., as affecting the withdrawal of
                            guerrillas”.</p>
                        <p>Thailand: <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, despite a basic
                            sympathy for Malaysia and impatience with Indonesia, played a most
                            effective role as mediator during the two Bangkok ministerial meetings
                            earlier this year and seems to have gained the confidence of all three
                            parties. Although inactive during the prolonged impasse that has
                            followed the second Bangkok meeting, he has continued to serve as a
                            channel of communication between the disputants (particularly in the
                            re-establishing of Malaysian-Philippine consular relations) and has
                            expressed to us his willingness to take part in further
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The U.K.: The British have been <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s main propaganda target since early in the
                            dispute and have, of course, borne the brunt of the guerrilla fighting.
                            Although not willing to foreclose entirely the possibility of a
                            negotiated settlement, they have been particularly skeptical of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s intentions and
                            have advocated a generally stiff line with him.</p>
                        <p>The British have frequently used their influence with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to urge moderation in his public
                            statements, with mixed results. They have, however, been sensitive to
                            any hint that they use their increasingly limited leverage in Kuala
                            Lumpur to press for substantive Malaysian concessions in the interest of
                            a settlement. In general, the British position has been a rather rigid
                            one. While understandable under the circumstances, this position at
                            times has unquestionably exacerbated the situation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BRA3">Butler</persName>'s visit to Manila at the
                            beginning of May, however, seems to have been accompanied by a
                            noticeable shift toward greater flexibility, at least in Britain's
                            public position. Butler endorsed the concept of an “Asian solution”,
                            actively encouraged <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s
                            initiative, and even indicated publicly—as far as we are aware, for the
                            first time—that the U.K. has no objection to Maphilindo. On the other
                            hand, shortly <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0147"/>before the visit
                            the British government authorized several new retaliatory measures
                            against the guerrillas in Borneo, including limited hot pursuit into
                            Indonesia. We are informed that these will begin after May 15.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations: There remains the question of a possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in the dispute. Although the
                            Secretary General's formal involvement ended with his report of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ascertainment in September 1963,
                            he has continued periodically to express his interest in developments
                            and has recently indicated his willingness to provide good offices.
                            Apart from the Secretary General, there has been a rather unclear series
                            of exchanges between the British and the Malaysians over the possibility
                            of bringing the matter to the Security Council. The British have told us
                            that they believe an approach to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            should, for the present, be limited to the submission of Malaysia's case
                            by letter to the Security Council President for information and
                            distribution to members. There are, however, some indications that the
                            British may have gone beyond this at one time by suggesting that the
                            Malaysians seek Security Council action. Our latest information is that
                            both sides are now agreed on an informational letter to the Security
                            Council President and that the text is now being drafted.</p>
                        <p>We have engaged in informal contingency discussions in New York with the
                            British, Australians and New Zealanders over a possible approach to the
                            Security Council should the situation require it. The consensus has
                            been, however, that the time for resort to the Security Council has not
                            yet arrived.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion </p>
                        <p>At the moment, prospects for a summit meeting within the next month or
                            less, perhaps preceded by lower-level talks, seem fairly bright. It is
                            still an open question whether a summit can produce a formula for
                            settlement acceptable to both sides, and indeed whether <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> really wants a settlement.
                            Proposals which might lead to a settlement, however, are beginning to
                            emerge (i.e., Afro-Asian mediation). In addition, the very act of
                            attending a summit meeting has on past occasions instilled in the
                            principals a greater flexibility than they normally display.</p>
                        <p>The dispute unquestionably remains a most serious one, and chances for a
                            peaceful resolution are still very much in doubt. There does appear to
                            be some promise in the situation, however. As long as it persists, our
                            interests would seem to require that we continue our efforts to
                            encourage current moves to convene a summit meeting.</p>

                            could agree to this (even without necessarily specifying dates) it would
                            give <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> a superb handle to talk
                            further to the Malaysians tomorrow—which he should do in any event—and
                            would give a most useful fillip to the Malaysian state of mind at this
                            point. I urge strongly that you try to clear this with the President at
                            or around the luncheon.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">A note in the margin

                            think they should be persuaded to hold off on it until we see finally
                            whether or not the summit can be put together. We cabled you on this in
                            The Hague, and it would be helpful to know whether you had a chance to

                            At same time, we regard these meetings as only foreseeable chance of

                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>We are aware that visit to US is something <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wants, that he has been

                        <p>Problem, therefore, is to help move <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> toward constructive attitude in Tokyo by holding

                            might change if summit dramatically successful, suggest that for present

                            wishes make visit to World's Fair this year, and that he may come to US
                            for this purpose after Tokyo. If he does so, US public reaction to
                            events of past year will undoubtedly cause his public reception to be
                            less friendly than on former visits. But if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> does come, President would
                            receive him in Washington for informal meeting before or after New York

                        <p>We would anticipate that Washington visit would be handled as outlined

                        <p>1. In retrospect, Dept sees Tokyo summit as having produced very mixed
                            result. Parties made no progress in halting military confrontation
                            (immediate result, in fact, may be to intensify it dangerously) or
                            otherwise bridging gap between Indo and Malaysian positions. Tokyo <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0151"/>atmosphere also failed produce
                            hoped-for diminution of mutual distrust and antipathy between Indo and
                            Malaysian leadership. Instead, it sharpened them.</p>
                        <p>2. On other hand, summit did result in several potentially significant
                            gains. While parties scarcely touched on thorny problem of political
                            settlement—particularly Indo demand for Borneo reascertainment—they did
                            reach agreement in principle on machinery to bring about political
                            settlement (Afro-Asian conciliation commission) and on steps to set up
                            machinery, i.e., further contacts between FonMins followed by another
                            summit. This achievement admittedly a tenuous one, however, since
                            Malaysians accepted commission proposal reluctantly and with little real
                            faith in it.</p>
                        <p>3. Further achievement was clear emergence <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> as genuinely impartial third party in eyes Indos
                            and Malaysians. Both delegations indicated publicly and privately their
                            faith in Phil bona fides. This achievement, however, somewhat clouded by
                            Phil exasperation at Malaysians for their rigid position at summit and
                            their “evasive” handling Phil Sabah claim in concurrent bilateral talks
                            (Tokyo's 3867).<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">Dated June 20. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. Reasons for Impasse: 1. Controversy over relationship of guerrilla
                            withdrawals to political settlement was crux of difficulty. Malaysian
                            attitude throughout was one of injured righteousness which, although
                            justified, tended to foreclose chances real progress. Understandably
                            they concentrated almost exclusively on short-term goal of getting Indo
                            forces off their soil and halting other forms confrontation. They
                            refused recognize any direct connection between this objective and
                            political settlement sought by Indos, seeing latter as Indo-contrived
                            artificial issue to be disposed of after confrontation terminated. They
                            could recognize hypothetical Sukarno need for face-saving device if he
                            honestly wanted end confrontation, but they rejected basic premise that
                            he wanted do so. In their view, what Sukarno wanted at most was brief
                            pause to enable him prepare for renewed onslaught. This deep mistrust
                            Indo motives led them to insist that elaborate minuet of verified
                            withdrawal through designated checkpoints be carried to conclusion even
                            after it had become clear that pressure of time was making it no more
                            than farce; it prevented them from making any effort exploit Sukarno
                            personality traits to their advantage as suggested in Djakarta's
                                2506;<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">Dated June 4. (Ibid.)</note> and,
                            in final analysis, it kept them from making real test <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> intentions by <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0152"/>failing offer him course of action
                            which, in context his own prestige and his internal situation, he could
                            reasonably be expected accept.</p>
                        <p>2. Contributing to impasse reached during final June 20 summit session
                            was fact that Malaysian position throughout preceding week had been
                            anything but clear and had left others unprepared for final rigidity.
                            For example, during prolonged wrangle over checkpoints Malaysians made
                            at least one concession—agreeing to first FonMin meeting before
                            beginning of withdrawal—which suggested greater flexibility on Malaysian
                            side than ultimately demonstrated. In this context, both US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> observers noted signs of tension within
                            Malaysian delegation, with <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> and other hard-liners ranged against others who
                            seemed to favor more flexible position.</p>
                        <p>3. Indos contributed their bit to final impasse by poisoning already
                            tense atmosphere with arrogant and meretricious press release June 14
                            (Tokyo's 3732),<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4">The press release is
                                summarized in telegram 3732 from Tokyo, June 14. (Ibid.)</note>
                            which hit Malaysians hard and sparked sporadic crossfire of public
                            statements during rest of meeting. Aside from this, however, Indos
                            handled selves fairly well and managed convey general impression they
                            were genuinely seeking way out. (Malaysian EmbOff, however, told Dept
                            that June 19 attack in Sarawak by guerrillas crossing from Indo had
                            completely destroyed Malaysian hopes that Indos were sincere in their
                            presummit undertakings.)</p>
                        <p>4. As emphasized by <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> (Tokyo's
                            3867), final and probably conclusive reason for impasse was that time
                            ran out before real effort could be made to bridge gap between positions
                            taken by Indos and Malaysians at June 20 afternoon session. <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> expressed personal belief that,
                            had he and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> been given
                            day or two to work on both sides, they could have hammered out
                            acceptable compromise linking withdrawals to commission proposal.
                            Alternately, had Malaysians made clear to Macapagal earlier in week that
                            they intended demand end to confrontation before activation commission,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> might have been able
                            work out something. (Fact that they did not do so reinforces our
                            suspicion that Malaysians did not actually decide on their position
                            until last minute.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Future Prospects:</p>
                        <p>1. Most immediate hazard is that Indos will respond to summit failure by
                            promptly stepping up border warfare in Borneo and terrorism on mainland,
                            reasoning that lull in hostilities in month preceding summit had made
                            Malaysians overconfident and that what they now need is period of
                            softening up before next round negotiations. (Press reports of major
                            clash in Borneo this week suggests this has already begun.) British and
                            Malaysians may respond with cross-border operations. <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0153"/>Quite apart from obvious danger of
                            escalation hostilities, Indo step up in military confrontation likely be
                            taken by Malaysians as confirming their belief Indos have no intention
                            seeking real settlement, thereby further dimming chances for negotiated
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. Since Malaysians have long had their eyes on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and their initial position at Tokyo was to take issue to
                            Security Council, there will undoubtedly be strong move in Kuala Lumpur
                            to go to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> now, either in response
                            increased Indo military activity or as result summit failure itself.</p>
                        <p>3. If above two obstacles to further negotiations can be surmounted—and
                            chances not too promising—prospects for peaceful settlement might
                            improve substantially now that device for settlement has been surfaced
                            in <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s commission
                            proposal. While commission at first glance may seem little more than
                            gimmick, it could prove good deal more in practice. Phils do not appear
                            to see commission as quasi-judicial body, taking evidence and retiring
                            from scene to draw up recommendations in isolation. Instead, it would
                            operate as genuine conciliatory body, working out its recommendations
                            through process of consultation and negotiations with both parties. It
                            could, in effect, operate in same manner as did <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> in hammering out May 27 summit
                            agreement but with much greater authority. Commission could also play
                            highly useful role in inducing both sides to exercise restraint while it
                            seized with issue and could serve as channel of appeal by either side
                            against mistreatment by other during this period. Moreover, commission
                            would seem precisely that sort of device which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> likely find most palatable
                            as pill-sweetener, in that he could (a) make great point of bowing to
                            its will as munificent contribution to Afro-Asian unity and (b) avoid
                            giving any appearance giving in directly to “neo-colonialist”
                            Malaysians.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate post comments foregoing analysis.<note n="5" xml:id="d51fn5">In telegram 21 from Djakarta, July 2, the Embassy
                                suggested that Indonesian policy was aimed at a negotiated
                                settlement as close as possible to its terms and without a
                                withdrawal of its guerrillas. (Ibid.) In telegram 1317 from Kuala
                                Lumpur, June 27, the Embassy suggested that Malaysia had accepted
                                the commission proposal reluctantly and would only implement it if
                                Indonesian military confrontation ceased. The Embassy did not accept
                                that Malaysia was responsible for the impasse at the summit and
                                suggested that Malaysia viewed withdrawal of Indonesia forces
                                seriously. (Ibid.) In telegram 28 from Manila, July 4, the Embassy
                                suggested that although it agreed with the assessment of what
                                happened and why, the estimate of future prospects was wrong in
                                certain respects. The Embassy suggested continued efforts at urging
                                moderation, caution towards more summit or ministerial meetings, not
                                becoming too closely identified with the Afro-Asian Commission,
                                resolving the Philippine claim to Sabah with Malaysia first, and
                                encouraging Malaysia to deal with the Borneo guerrillas on their own
                                rather than relying completely on the British. (Ibid.)</note>

                            the designation of an “Afro-Asian Conciliation Commission” to assist the

                            directed to attempts to restrain violent speech and action. Our effort
                            will be to keep the attention of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> focused on the fact that there is an agreement
                            which must be carried out, starting with a meeting of the Foreign

                        <p>2. As you know, our limited programs of economic and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance with Indonesia have
                            continued, in accordance with your decision recorded in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 278 of February 3, 1964, pending the
                            outcome of the “Summit Meeting.” In my judgment, concurred in by the
                            Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, it is essential to the national interest to continue
                            carefully selected economic and military assistance to Indonesia of the
                            types now being provided. We should not, however, make a formal public
                            announcement of continued assistance for this might give unwarranted
                            encouragement to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. If you approve the above recommendation, we

                        <p rend="center">ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA</p>
                        <p>Indonesia, in terms of size, natural resources and strategic location, is
                            a key country of Asia. In the midst of a convulsive transition from the
                            colonial past, it has become a major target of the Communist powers and
                            is itself a source of tension in Southeast Asia. For the past nine
                            months it has been pursuing a policy of political, economic and military
                            “confrontation” against Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>Our Indonesia policy requirements are two-fold: (1) to halt Indonesia's
                            “confrontation” against Malaysia and restore equilibrium to the area and
                            (2) to influence the course of Indonesia's long-range development in a
                            direction consistent with our security needs.</p>
                        <p>Our aid programs have been an essential tool in this dual task. Over the
                            years, they have helped us keep open the communications between our two
                            Governments and build up a limited but real leverage with the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime, which we are using
                            to prevent a dangerous drift away from the West. Although
                            “confrontation” has not yet been abandoned, our influence has probably
                            helped prevent greater deterioration <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0156"/>and encouraged the Indonesian Government to join with
                            Malaysia and the Philippines in seeking a peaceful settlement of their
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>Those forms of assistance which could help Indonesia maintain
                            “confrontation” against Malaysia have been eliminated, and we do not
                            intend to resume them so long as “confrontation” continues.</p>
                        <p>The present <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program is limited to
                            technical assistance, including civil leadership training and advisory
                            services, malaria eradication assistance, and police training and
                            equipment. (Arms and ammunition have been and are being withheld.) The
                            present Military Assistance Program is limited to training in those
                            categories which do not contribute to Indonesia's immediate offensive
                            capability. The training is almost entirely confined to operations,
                            logistics and administrative fields. However, no training is being
                            provided in such fields as ranger, pathfinder, airborne,
                            counter-insurgency, parachute packing, in-flight re- fueling, and
                            landing force staff planning.</p>
                        <p>The reduced <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program totals approximately $10

                        <p>We are currently training 490 civilian technicians, administrators and
                            managers, and 170 military personnel (including 50 officers under the
                            civic action program) who will play an important part in Indonesia's
                            future leadership. In addition, U.S. university faculty teams in
                            Indonesian institutions are reaching thousands of additional key
                            Indonesians. Our training programs give us a unique opportunity to shape
                            the thinking of Indonesia's future civilian police and military leaders.
                            Continuation of the malaria eradication program, benefiting
                            approximately 70,000,000 people of the central islands, is protecting an
                            existing investment of some $36 million and would demonstrate our
                            continuing concern for the Indonesian people. If we stopped now,
                            malaria—now virtually eradicated in Java and Bali—would almost
                            inevitably recur. The program of assisting the national police has given
                            us valuable influence in this key organization (the country's first line
                            of defense against internal subversion) and has greatly enhanced its
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of these limited programs is essential to achievement of our
                            policy objectives in Indonesia and to the national interest of the <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0157"/>United States. Termination of
                            the remaining programs would have little or no impact on Indonesia's
                            capacity to continue “confrontation.” The Indonesian Government would be
                            likely to react to such termination by lashing out in anger, pushing
                            “confrontation” harder, turning for help to the Communist powers, and
                            further widening the gap between Indonesia and the West. In the process,
                            substantial American oil and other private investment in Indonesia might

                            with impression we have no intention of advancing further suggestions,
                            that we see problem and current impasse in lapse Asian principals. Main
                            purpose your call should be convey deep sense personal and official
                            concern over deteriorating trend US-Indo relations which far transcend
                            quarrel with Malaysia. Same approach and theme should predominate in
                            other farewell talks with Indo leaders and Phil Amb. Reyes if you see
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Suggest your remarks to Sukarno follow following lines:</p>
                        <p>1) You depart with sense disappointment at inconclusive results Tokyo
                            meeting and current impasse in efforts principals find peaceful solution
                            Malaysian problem, but with even stronger conviction that this is Asian
                            problem and that Asian nations involved can and must find way out.</p>
                        <p>2) More profound and vastly more disturbing however is effect of military
                            confrontation on US-Indonesian relations. Since 1945, US and Indo have
                            differed on occasion, often strongly, on variety of issues. Nevertheless
                            a common dedication to basic ideals and principles embodied in Pantja
                            Sila and Declaration Independence has stood above these differences
                            preserving friendship and understanding and encouraging close US-Indo
                            cooperation in wide range common efforts. Over past six months however
                            Indos' policy re Malaysia has brought in its train progressively more
                            serious deterioration in US-Indo relations, a trend which if unchecked
                            could place basic fabric our relationship in jeopardy. This
                            deterioration marked by series of actions of such evident <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0159"/>hostility to US as to arouse doubts
                            about Indonesian desires and intentions. To cite specific examples:</p>
                        <p>a. Intense and growing anti-US propaganda campaign throughout Indo, which
                            obviously being carried on with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> acquiescence. Not only has <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> allowed this campaign reach
                            unprecedented levels but <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leaders
                            have directly contributed to it by participating in, and in some cases
                            sponsoring, public functions at which US main target.</p>
                        <p>b. Apparent Indo decision abandon longstanding policy of non-involvement
                            in Viet Nam issue (parting company, incidentally, with mainstream
                            Afro-Asian attitude) in favor increasingly open support communist North
                            Viet Nam and <gloss target="#t_NLFSVN1">NLFSVN</gloss> which is its
                            agent. We can only take this as direct affront to US efforts defend
                            South Viet Nam against external aggression—efforts which Sukarno must
                            understand we are utterly determined pursue to successful
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>c. Parallel Indo decision to place selves on communist side in Korea by
                            recognizing Pyongyang regime. In this case, Indo not only offering
                            affront to US but to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as well.</p>
                        <p>d. Public statements by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leaders
                            clearly portraying US as opponent Indo policies in Southeast Asia, such
                            as Gen Yani's June 22 remarks (Djakarta's 2602) and Abdulgani's June 28
                            speech (Djakarta's 2638).<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">Dated June 23 and

                            cite these particular examples. We would not want undercut Yani's
                            position by singling him out for criticism and same goes to lesser
                            extent for Abdulgani. On other hand, might even help Yani a bit to
                            express concern at his remarks. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3) Malaysian problem and confrontation has also within US tarnished
                            Indonesian image and made it progressively more difficult for
                            Indonesia's friends in Government, Congress, the press, and public at
                            large to understand and explain Indonesia's position. To <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> Indo case needs no
                            justification. Indonesia's American friends, however, see South East
                            Asia's only major power, dwarfing all neighbors in area, population,
                            natural resources, military strength, resorting to military force in
                            political dispute with small, militarily weak neighbor, leaving this
                            neighbor no honorable recourse but to draw into dispute European power
                            whose departure from area Indonesia, paradoxically, wishes to
                            accelerate. No one admires a bully.</p>

                        <p>Malaysia-Indonesia Dispute. For your background prior to the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s visit next week, this pot is
                            still simmering and could rapidly heat up.</p>
                        <p>So far we've managed (with help from Philippines and Thais) to keep it
                            damped down by a series of time-buying maneuvers. But the long awaited
                            Tokyo summit meeting in late June failed to bridge the gap. The Indos
                            did pull out a few guerrillas from Malaysian Borneo, but they evaded
                            full scale withdrawal. The one thing Tokyo did produce was
                            acceptance—most reluctantly by the Malaysians—of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0161"/>proposal for the creation of a four-nation Afro-Asian
                            conciliation commission. The Foreign Ministers are to meet in due course
                            to study this proposal and to work toward another summit. This is a thin
                            reed to lean on, but we're trying.</p>
                        <p>The Indos evidently anticipate a new Foreign Ministers' meeting in
                            August. They've also suggested that the Thais re-inject themselves as an
                            intermediary in place of the Filipinos. But Indonesian guerrillas
                            continue sporadically active in Borneo, and an incident any time could
                            wreck the chances of a meeting.</p>
                        <p>At present both parties are seeking to line up international support—the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> at the Commonwealth
                            Prime Minister's Conference and next week in Washington, the Indonesians
                            in Bangkok and Moscow. The Indos claim they're getting a lot more Soviet
                            arms, but we suspect these may just be a speeding up of previous
                            orders.</p>
                        <p>The big uncertainty is Indonesia's real intentions. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is heavily committed to
                            “confrontation”, both by his words and by pressures from the Indo
                            Communists and the Army. Yet there is evidence that the results of
                            “confrontation” have disappointed him to date, and that he might step
                            back from over-commitment for the time being if a face-saving device
                            could be found.</p>
                        <p>The Afro-Asian Conciliation Commission may well serve this purpose.
                            Through the process of negotiation leading up to such a commission, and
                            the inevitably lengthy process of conciliation by the commission, we
                            could hope that hostilities would be kept damped down.</p>
                        <p>To keep the parties talking rather than fighting, we'll have to continue
                            using the carrot and stick on both the Indonesians and the Malaysians
                            (and their Commonwealth allies). This is no time to give the Indos many
                            goodies, but we do want to keep dangling the prospect of renewed Western
                            aid if Sukarno would only stop acting up.</p>
                        <p>It would be easy for us to join the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in
                            all-out support for Malaysia and to dare <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to up the ante. This might scare off the Bung
                            for now, but more likely just push him closer to Peking and Moscow and
                            into more reliance on the Communists at home. Our aim is not just to
                            turn off the jungle fighting in Borneo, but to do it in a way that
                            doesn't lose Indonesia to us. Rather a neutralist Sukarno than a
                            Communist running the country. So it still makes sense for us to lean
                            over backwards (without sacrificing Malaysia), so long as there's even a
                            reasonable chance that we can keep the lid from blowing off.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains
                            virtually all-powerful in Indonesia and there is almost no chance that
                            his rule or his policies will be effectively challenged by any group,
                            movement, or individual during his lifetime. Neither increased economic
                            stringency nor dissidence in the outer islands is likely to threaten
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s position
                            seriously. (Para. 3)</p>
                        <p>B. Over the past year <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            has tended to reinforce the position of the Indonesian Communist Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) and reduce the political
                            influence of the military. Although <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            influence in the government remains relatively limited, it is likely to
                            continue growing as long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains in power. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> does not seek to establish
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> dominance but, over the long
                            term, to fuse it with other radical and nationalist elements that he has
                            slowly drawn into supporting his objectives. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, well aware of his tactic, will probably continue
                            ostensibly to support <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, in the belief that in the long run the Communist
                            cause will be the chief beneficiary of the economic, social, and
                            political disarray he will bequeath to Indonesia. (Paras. 2–14)</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0163"/>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s campaign to
                            disrupt Malaysia—“confrontation”—has helped accelerate the drift toward
                            the radical left and will do so further if, as seems likely, the
                            campaign continues. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            will probably continue to seek to avoid open hostilities with British
                            Commonwealth forces, because of the uncertainty of victory. A decisive
                            trend in the struggle in South Vietnam, either way, would have some
                            effect upon political forces in Indonesia and upon the pitch of the
                            anti-Malaysia campaign. But, in any case, the mainsprings of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s foreign policy actions
                            will continue to be found primarily in purely Indonesian considerations.
                            (Paras. 1, 33, 36)</p>
                        <p>D. Confrontation has speeded the deterioration of the Indonesian economy.
                            The most serious short-term problems are growing shortages of foodstuffs
                            and other consumer necessities, and a heavy balance of payments deficit;
                            prospects for improvement are not bright. The political impact has thus
                            far been slight, but if food shortages persist, the problem of
                            maintaining public order in urban areas could become serious. (Paras.
                            17–2)</p>
                        <p>E. These developments will probably not lead to any marked changes in
                            Indonesian foreign policy over the next few years. Indonesia's growing
                            cordiality with Communist China will probably continue, based on a near
                            identity of short-term interests in the Afro-Asian world. The USSR,
                            clearly disappointed by its failure to achieve predominant influence in
                            Indonesia, even in the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, possesses
                            only limited influence with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> despite its vast military assistance to
                            confrontation. (Paras. 34–35)</p>
                        <p>F. The road ahead for Indonesia is a troubled one of domestic
                            deterioration, external aggression, and overall Communist profit. This
                            prospect will not brighten until and unless Indonesia's energies are
                            turned from foreign ambitions, which probably include Portuguese Timor
                            and, in due course, the rest of New Guinea, and are devoted to the
                            development of this potentially rich country. It is unlikely that such a
                            shift will occur so long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dominates Indonesia. (Para. 37)</p>

                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName> met alone on July 22. No
                                    record of their conversation was made, but for a second-hand
                                    account of their meeting, see Document 265. In a memorandum to
                                    the President, July 23, <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> suggested that this meeting “seemed free
                                    of knotty problems.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> thought that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s visit had been smooth,
                                    his mood was good, he was pleased with overt signs of U.S.
                                    support, but <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> feared
                                    that the Prime Minister was using his Washington visit as a
                                    platform for “tough anti-Indo talk.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> suggested the problem was that the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> might get
                                    “too-cocky towards <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> because he thinks he's got us in his hip
                                    pocket.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> suggested
                                    that the President emphasize to the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> the need for care and restraint in
                                    relations with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>—“let the other guy make the
                                    mistakes”—lowering the rhetoric, mending fences with the
                                    Philippines, and not to let the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> think he has a “blank check” for U.S.
                                    credit sales and training. (Johnson Library, National Security

                        <p>The President greeted the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            warmly and asked him if he approved the communique. The President and
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> each read the draft
                                communique<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Printed in American Foreign
                                Policy: Current Documents, 1964, pp. 899–900.</note> after which
                            each expressed approval.</p>
                        <p>The President then told the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            that he hoped he returned to Malaysia with a clear sense of our support
                            and admiration for him and for his country. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> expressed his appreciation and
                            thanks for all the kindness shown him on this visit.</p>
                        <p>The President reminded the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            of their conversation of July 22 about U.S. policy and said he hoped he
                            understood our views. We thought it wise to be careful not to antagonize
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> unnecessarily. We
                            applauded the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s restraint
                            and urged him to continue to play his statesmanlike role. Patience and
                            restraint were important; “if we can be patient enough, the other fellow
                            will make the errors”. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            nodded assent and indicated that he agreed with the President's
                            position. The President then expressed his hope that Malaysia could <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0165"/>solve its troubles with the
                            Philippines. Dissension between Malaysia and the Philippines was only
                            “water on the paddle of the Indonesian extremists.”</p>
                        <p>We looked forward, the President indicated, to further talks in regard to
                            Malaysia's desire for credits and military training. We would be glad to
                            have the Malaysian Chief of Staff come here or to talk with other
                            Malaysian defense people on this matter.</p>
                        <p>On the question of relations with the Philippines, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> said, the Filipino attitude was
                            disappointing. When he and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> had met in Cambodia, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> had asked the latter if there
                            were any problems and suggested that these could easily be resolved. He
                            was willing to let the Filipino claim go to a bilateral group, but the
                            Filipinos didn't seem much interested in better relations. As the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> put it, “they were with
                            us in the <gloss target="#t_ASA1">ASA</gloss> but now they seem to take
                            sides with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.” This was
                            a great disappointment. The Filipinos were unlike the Thais who had been
                            with Malaysia from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            about the riots in Singapore, saying that we had our own problems in New
                            York. He hoped the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> was more
                            successful than he had been in stopping this sort of trouble. The Prime
                            Minister replied that the situation in Singapore was still tense. There
                            had been three more deaths but the situation seemed to be quieting down.
                            The President hoped the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            wouldn't have to cut his visit short and go back early. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> said he was considering this but
                            hoped to be able to go on to Canada.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            invited the President to visit Malaysia at some early and convenient
                            time.</p>

                                August 7, the Department presented its views on prospects for the
                                Indon-Malaysian dispute. It believed that the Afro-Asian
                                Conciliation Commission (<gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>) must
                                be pursued and not rejected by Malaysia. The basic obstacle to peace
                                remained Indonesian guerrillas in East Malaysia and the Department
                                suggested that the <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> might be

                                to withdraw them. Such a plan would require careful prearrangement

                            Malaysian dispute:</p>
                        <p>1. Neither principal appears interested in continuing formal direct
                            negotiations in absence clear exits from Tokyo impasse. Current level
                            guerrilla activity is low, and Indos engaged in diplomatic activity to
                            develop further support from Soviet Union, North Korea, and North
                            Viet-Nam. <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> preoccupied with internal
                            problems, and attention likely to be focused inward in first weeks
                            following <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s return.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> initiative for resort to
                            salutary secret preparatory diplomacy appears best and perhaps only way
                            to avoid creating in <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> another
                            imposing but empty negotiating mechanism.</p>
                        <p>3. Phils are committed to publicized direct negotiations and, in view
                            foregoing, their role for present essentially unconstructive. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> for personal and domestic
                            political reasons appear determined however to pursue role of mediator
                            and probably cannot be diverted.</p>
                        <p>Under circumstances Dept feels that, while approach outlined cirtel 252
                            as modified by posts' comments still valid, time for pursuing it does
                            not seem to have arrived. Agree with Kuala Lumpur 150 that Thai
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> is essential and
                            therefore Phils must be committed to naming Thais as their rep on <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> before Malaysians announce choice
                            Nigerians. Prior and secret Phil agreement is therefore necessary first
                            step in implementing plan, but difficult to accomplish in context
                            current Phil efforts. As Phils run up against <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> footdragging on
                            resumption formal talks opportunity may then arise for essential

                        <p>For Bangkok: Department believes that at this stage best procedure would

                        <p>On the assumption that Indonesia is likely to be discussed at your lunch
                            with the President, I thought it might be useful for you to have a brief
                            summary of our current view of the situation, and my preliminary
                            estimate as to how we may have to react to it. I must emphasize that <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0169"/>these conclusions about future
                            developments are still very tentative, and have not been cleared or
                            discussed in detail outside this Bureau. I thought, however, you might
                            wish to have them for your conversation with the President.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s August 17
                                speech<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">See <ref target="#d59fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 59</ref>.</note> (full text not yet available) was a
                            catalogue of specific points in Indonesian foreign policy in direct
                            opposition to ours, and included lengthy sections on domestic affairs in
                            which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> set forth views
                            identical with or very close to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.
                            During the period immediately preceding the speech various Indonesian
                            groups with or without Government blessing seized our <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Library in Djogjakarta, threatened
                            take-overs or boycotts of several American private businesses, and
                            increased the tempo of the current anti-American campaign. We assume
                            that the stridency of the August 17 period will now give way to relative
                            calm, but believe we are faced with an Indonesian Government which is
                            increasingly moving away from the United States both internally and
                            externally. That is also our Embassy's judgment.</p>
                        <p>During the same recent period we have had a new amendment on Indonesian
                            aid passed by the Senate.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">See <ref target="#d59fn4">footnote 4, Document 59</ref>.</note> As we
                            understand it, the present hope is that the final bill will contain the
                            Tower amendment as written, further amended to give the President
                            discretionary authority to continue such aid as he considers in the
                            national interest. The practical effect of this would seem to be that
                            shortly after the bill becomes law the President will be faced with the
                            necessity of making a publicized formal determination on aid to
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Bearing in mind both the difficulty of making a favorable determination
                            in the light of Indonesia's recent conduct and the undesirability of
                            giving <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> a pat on the
                            back by doing so at this point, I am considering areas in which the
                            current Indonesian program could be contracted, both to get the lesson
                            home to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and to reduce
                            pressures in the United States. Specifically I believe that the time may
                            have come when we should terminate aid to Indonesian military and
                            paramilitary organizations, but that we should attempt to maintain over
                            the next years as much of a program of educational exchange and support
                            for Indonesian educational institutions as we can. If possible, it would
                            seem desirable to continue the Peace Corps program and the program for
                            malaria eradication.</p>
                        <p>If the United States should announce termination of aid to the Indonesian
                            military as a unilateral action we would expect a strong and perhaps
                            violent Indonesian reaction. We would expect abrogation <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0170"/>of the agreement protecting our oil
                            properties and loss of other American investments, and would anticipate
                            violence against Government installations and perhaps people, a
                            situation which would obviously create a new major problem to us in
                            Southeast Asia in the months ahead.</p>
                        <p>If we decide to terminate military aid we believe there is a good chance
                            that we could exit with minimum adverse reaction from the present
                            situation by pointing out to the Indonesians that the Tower amendment
                            and their own policies are leading toward the ending of such aid, and
                            suggesting to them that, in the interests of removing irritants to our
                            relations, we agree to immediate termination of our military assistance
                            program, and that the Indonesian Government issue an announcement to
                            this effect. On the basis of discussions which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> had with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Subandrio last spring
                            we believe that the Indonesians might find this an attractive and
                            face-saving approach to the problem. (<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> at that time spoke of such Indonesian action
                            as a useful way of removing programs which were becoming irritations in
                            our relations rather than contributing to them.) From our point of view,
                            encouraging Indonesia to take this course would stand a better chance of
                            relieving us of increasingly embarrassing programs without creating the
                            long-range obstacle to the resumption of good relations with any
                            Indonesian Government which would undoubtedly result from unilateral
                            American action.</p>
                        <p>For the foregoing plan to work, it would be necessary to discuss the
                            subject quietly with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> soon, as the
                            Indonesians would have to act before the aid bill becomes law. I plan,
                            therefore, to make a detailed recommendation to you on this subject as
                            soon as the status of the Tower amendment becomes more clear, but
                            thought you might wish to go over the subject in general terms with the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>The more we look at it, the more all of us working on Asia fear that
                            Tower's amendment, even with discretionary language, not only <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0171"/>puts you on the spot but moves
                            us dangerously close to a final break with Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s speech, irresponsible
                            though it was, is a clear signal that he may have decided there's no
                            hope of keeping open a bridge to us.</p>
                        <p>A. The foreign policy case for not giving <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> new grounds to react is a powerful one. We've
                            strung him along for years (with our eyes open), on the basic premise
                            that if he swung too far left we'd lose the third largest country in
                            Asia—whose strategic location and 100 million people make it a far
                            greater prize than Vietnam. To leave <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> no opening toward us multiplies the odds that
                            he'll end up the prisoner of his powerful CP (largest in Free Asia and
                            Peking-oriented).</p>
                        <p>B. Since Tower's language calls for immediately stopping all aid and
                            training, he or others could press for an immediate determination under
                            the discretionary language—thus putting on you the burden of going
                            against the will of Congress (before the election). So it's worse than
                            the Broomfield amendment, with which we've lived for many months. Though
                            I passed word to <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that you left the issue
                            to their judgment and that your main objective was to dispose of Tower,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had already moved to
                            offer discretionary language to <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> and Dirksen. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> apparently hesitate now
                            to re-open the issue without a signal from you.</p>
                        <p>I'd argue, however, that we've met any obligation to Dirksen by State
                            giving him the discretionary language, and that we could now try to kill
                            Tower outright in conference. If not we could always retreat.</p>
                        <p>State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> experts propose we quietly tell
                            Indos pronto we're suspending all military aid (aside from completing
                            the training of Indo officers already here—to send them packing would be
                            an insult), and continuing only the minor <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> technical assistance. Then we could clue conferees
                            quietly that we've done most of what Congress wants, so please drop
                            Tower amendment and not box you in.<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> telephoned Senator
                                Everett Dirksen at 6:35 p.m. on August 18. Dirksen stated that
                                discretionary language did not do any good. This was a “difficult
                                parliamentary situation” and the Tower amendment could not be
                                amended nor could it be vacated because of opposition. Dirksen
                                talked to <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> and they thought
                                it best to let it go to the House where “Tom Morgan and his boys
                                would stand fast and take it.” Dirksen said there would not be “too
                                much ruckus from our side. There is a matter of pride.” (Ibid.,

                            of either defying the will of Congress in an unpopular cause or letting
                            the break with Indonesia move further to the point of no return.</p>

                            speech on 17 August explicitly confirms his accelerated swing to the
                            left during the past 18 months.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">In telegram
                                317 from Djakarta, August 18, the Embassy stated that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s speech “cannot be
                                shrugged off as more of the same.” As he had in previously prepared
                                major speeches, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                declared “Indonesia in the camp of Asian Communists and opposed to
                                US—opposed not only on issues of the day like Vietnam and Malaysia,
                                but fundamentally opposed to our thought, our influence and our
                                leadership.” (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
                                Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1
                                INDON)</note> It charts a course—both international and
                            domestic—which is close to the immediate objectives of the Indonesian
                            Communist Party. The speech precludes any real relaxation of the
                            intensified anti-Americanism in Indonesia of the last few months.
                            Although the anti-American campaign may ebb and flow to suit the
                            purposes of Sukarno or the Communist Party, the long-range intent will
                            remain unchanged: get the US out of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> declared that
                            non-Asians must leave all of Asia, that South Korea and South Vietnam
                            are “not yet free,” and that Laos will be “truly neutral, united, and
                            democratic” only if the imperialists withdraw their troops from the
                            area. He announced that “we condemn as strongly as possible the American
                            attack on North Vietnam.” He castigated Malaysia intermittently
                            throughout the speech, referring to it variously as a “barking dog,” a
                            “watchdog,” and a “puppet” of imperialism.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding relations with the United States, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that despite repeated
                            evidence of US Government hostility toward Indonesia over the years, he
                            had tried to remain friendly toward America. US support of Malaysia,
                            however, he said was “too much.” The US was pretending to be friendly
                            with both Indonesia and Malaysia; friendship with both, according to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, is impossible,
                            and Indonesia will not accept such a pretense.</p>
                        <p>4. On the subject of cultural relations with the West and particularly
                            with the US, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he
                            was no longer able to consider America the “center of an idea.” He
                            strongly criticized those Indonesians <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0173"/>who copy Western ways and ridiculed Western efforts to
                            influence Indonesia through libraries, films, and other forms of
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p>5. On foreign investment, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made it clear that American interests eventually
                            would be taken over. “I wish to confirm that basically and eventually
                            there will be no imperialist capital operating on Indonesian soil.” He
                            said British businesses will be completely taken over by the government
                            and that compensation will depend upon the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s stand toward the liquidation of Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>6. Regarding domestic policy, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> emphasized that the “retooling” of reactionaries
                            would be carried on at all levels without letup. He reiterated his
                            long-standing concept of <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss>—the
                            fusion of nationalist, religious, and Communist elements in Indonesian
                            society and government—and said that whoever opposes NASAKOM opposes the
                            Indonesian revolution. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> endorsed the Communist concept of two stages of
                            revolution, noting that the present bourgeois democratic stage would be
                            succeeded in due course by a socialist stage.</p>
                        <p>7. He implied support of recent Communist land seizures, saying that the
                            “unilateral action” of farmers was understandable in view of the slow
                            implementation of land reform. He announced that land reform courts—a
                            Communist demand—will be established. He lavished praise on North Korean
                            agricultural successes and spoke of “freeing the productive power” of
                            Indonesian villages—possibly pointing toward a plan for agricultural
                            collectivism.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not indicate
                            any specific moves against US interests in the immediate future.
                            Considering the content of his speech, however, the seizure of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> library at Jogjakarta on 15
                            August was probably coordinated with Djakarta. Other threatened seizures
                            have not materialized, nor have there been further demonstrations
                            against US estates in North Sumatra. Rumored action against a US tire
                            factory in Bogor, West Java, also has not developed. In both areas, the
                            army and police have taken steps to protect American persons and
                            property.</p>
                        <p>9. The Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) moved
                            immediately to identify itself with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s speech and to prepare to exploit it in
                            furthering its own program wherever possible. A special statement by
                            party chairman Aidit on 18 August welcomed the speech as “fully in line”
                            with the struggle of the Indonesian and Southeast Asian peoples “at
                            present.” <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> has instructed
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> provincial officials and party
                            members to study the speech so that it may be used to “guide the
                            Indonesian people in their activities.”</p>
                        <p>10. The speech raises the question whether the position assumed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is fully his own
                            or whether it has been imposed upon him, at least in part, by the large
                            and highly effective Communist Party. Over the years, the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-Communist relationship has
                            appeared to be one of mutual exploitation. It seems highly unlikely that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0174"/>has long been a Communist and
                            is simply gradually surfacing his convictions now, but his predilection
                            for Marxist patterns of thought, his spirit of opportunism, and his
                            faith in his superb ability to manipulate individuals and groups may
                            have carried him too far. It would appear at this time that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has deliberately chosen, on
                            his own, to stand internationally with the anti-Western Asian world.
                            Domestically, however, it seems likely that because he lacks
                            administrative blueprints of his own and needs an effective organized
                            political instrument, he has allowed too much influence to slip into
                            Communist hands, and that he is well on his way to becoming a captive of
                            the Communists.</p>

                                to military assistance” and asked for his assessment. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Following is my assessment and recommendations on Indonesia in light
                            most recent events but with background <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s words and their implementation in action over
                            last 15 years. Admittedly crystal ball murky in this atmosphere but
                            seems necessary try use it anyway.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Assessment:</p>
                        <p>1. Although zigzag tactics <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime difficult predict the at least vague
                            outlines of its course just ahead seems set and short-term effect on US
                            official position here reasonably clear. US is in for harassment and
                            trouble from <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and other leftists and
                            government will only half-heartedly apply brakes to them under best of
                            circumstances we can expect. How far this will be allowed to affect
                            operations under private American investment here, particularly in oil,
                            not yet clear.</p>
                        <p>2. Malaysia, immediate cause rapid deterioration US-Indo relations over
                            last year, is not subject meaningful settlement so long as Indos, as
                            now, pursue negotiations as tactic to destroy Malaysia with objective
                            dominating territory, under one pretext or another.</p>

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will continue to spearhead
                            confrontation against Malaysia and lead popular support for most other
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> causes. Its
                            pressure on government in turn to espouse <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> causes will be unrelenting but so measured as to be at
                            same time irresistible to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> under present leadership too
                            sycophantic to other than follow <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s lead. NU has weak leadership and organization
                            and is unable do much but mute enthusiasm with which it says “me too” to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Other parties
                            either inconsequential or subject <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s manipulation or both.</p>
                        <p>5. Army will try to keep its unity and its correct attitude vis-a-vis
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Pressures on
                            army leadership for conformity will increase, however, and its strength
                            and unity of purpose under non-Communist leadership will inevitably
                            erode. Army will try to salvage as much as it can in way training and
                            keep its special relations with US military but this is likely to be
                            reduced soon to trickle or hiatus. Air force and navy have virtually
                            written off US assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. Indonesia's domestic and foreign posture will be dominated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s growing
                            megalomania. And whether as result decision made long ago by him or as
                            consequence his predilection for and training in revolution, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will lead Indonesia in way
                            which will strengthen hand <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and take
                            Indonesia further into Communist camp.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will continue his
                            drive for Asian-African leadership generally through espousing
                            anti-imperialism, etc. and particularly through promoting as many A–A
                            conferences as possible here in Indonesia. He will also make special
                            effort to exert leadership with North Korea, North Vietnam and Cambodia
                            and this will lead him to beat anti-US drum and echo Peking. Conscious
                            of Indo reliance on Soviets for arms and other support, Indonesia will
                            point effort to effect reconciliation of USSR and CPR.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his closest
                            advisers like <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            speak of passing through stages of revolution advancing to socialism
                            (communism). Although this process has at times appeared and now appears
                            to be moving rapidly, it has actually not gone very far. Army, most of
                            governing class (despite heavy Communist influence some Ministries such
                            as Basic Education, Information, Sports and Justice), larger part of
                            Moslem, mainly peasant population, is still unprepared and
                            “revolutionary” changes remain largely at verbal level or confined to
                            central authorities Djakarta. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> still
                            has much to do, as party itself seems aware (FND 7069)<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">Not further identified.</note> although <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> dedication, energy and drive and
                            financial backing should not be underestimated.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0176"/>
                        <p>9. Drive by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to take
                            Indonesia into Socialist camp is therefore race by him with Father Time
                            in which odds are against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s fellow revolutionaries have been dying off
                            fast last few years. New generation is coming on fast. Many of them can
                            be counted on to put their educations to work on Indonesia's real
                            problems of sagging economy and social backwardness, if and when they
                            get the chance. Need for US aid would then be magnet drawing them toward
                            us.</p>
                        <p>10. There is much discontent with economic waste and corruption and with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s arbitrary
                            disposition of Indonesia's financial resources on his pet projects.
                            Price of rice has reportedly doubled since Aug 17 speech. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s rice policy could well be
                            his Achilles heel with hitherto compliant population. There is some
                            dissidence and potential dissidence in outer islands like Sulawesi and
                            Sumatra. However, leadership and organization to make discontent and
                            dissidence effective in revolt is much less strong than in 1958. There
                            is some stirring in <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> and among what is
                            left of Masjumi but it is still too inchoate to be meaningful.</p>
                        <p>11. Although <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s bluster
                            gives verbal aid and comfort to enemies of US in Far East, Indonesia has
                            little real power to put in balance. It will tie down some British and
                            perhaps eventually Australian and New Zealand forces but will itself be
                            tied down in process.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1. In anticipation further deterioration US-Indo relations US should
                            reduce American presence subject to harassment here. It may actually
                            relieve situation to close out some less meaningful projects.
                            Specifically, where <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> projects are completed or when
                            Indonesians request US to end them, we should repatriate personnel with
                            least possible fanfare and publicity.</p>
                        <p>2. On basis foregoing, Congress should be persuaded not to include in
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bill any additional restrictions
                            on US aid to Indonesia to that contained in Presidential determination
                            provision.</p>
                        <p>3. To extent possible maintain those aid, civic action and military and
                            police assistance programs meaningful in terms of continuing contact and
                            future influence. Keeping our commitments on some non-tactical items
                            equipment will almost certainly be necessary to accommodate this.</p>
                        <p>4. On short notice be prepared to respond to emergency requests by
                            responsible Indonesian leaders for food, riot control equipment and
                            internal security items. This might entail stockpiling in areas close by
                            such as Philippines and/or Australia.</p>
                        <p>5. By covert and overt means increase volume and effectiveness with which
                            US version world events is provided Indonesians (this will require
                            injection funds and people—this is field where US has been losing
                            heaviest to ChiComs, Soviets and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>).</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0177"/>
                        <p>6. Avoid insofar as possible communication to press, American or foreign,
                            that any particular changes taking place in our policy toward Indonesia.
                            Our public posture should be as in past: (a) continue ongoing programs
                            as possible, (b) avoid taking position on substance Malaysian dispute,
                            (c) oppose use of force to settle Malaysian disputes, (d) desire by US
                            maintain friendship both Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>7. Keep contact open with <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> and other
                            elements opposed to Sukarno's anti-US policies ([<hi rend="italic">less

                        <p>8. Be alert to development potential for meaningful dissidence,
                            especially in outer islands and West Java, and be prepared move rapidly

                            the Tuesday lunch this week. Here is a run-down on current thinking in
                            the U.S. Government:</p>
                        <p>1. Since <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s August 17
                            speech and the “invasion” of Malayia in the wake of the Tower Amendment,
                            State and Defense had been assuming a firm Presidential decision to cut
                            off all military assistance to Indonesia. Now that the air has cleared a
                            bit with little coverage of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> speech in this country and with the apparent
                            death of the Tower Amendment, there is a faint but growing disposition
                            to move less rapidly on this subject.</p>
                        <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>2. State plans to review with <persName>Jones</persName> a proposed
                            approach to Sukarno on his return to Djakarta next week. These
                            instructions would involve his telling Sukarno in the next ten days or
                            so that inasmuch as U.S. military assistance has become an irritant to
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations both in Washington and in Djakarta, we should
                            jointly agree to end this program. State proposes this move in order to
                            take the heat off the Administration at home and in order to lay the
                            ground for a continuation of economic assistance on a mutually
                            acceptable basis. (The Indos are already taking action to suspend or
                            cancel substantial portions of our military training arrangements.)</p>
                        <p>3. At the working level in Defense, however, it is suggested that it
                            might be wise, before we bring about a
                                <persName>Jones</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> confrontation, to have our military people in
                            Djakarta (Colonels Harvey and Benson) go to Nasution and Jani for a
                            candid “where-the-hell-do-we-go-from-here” session in which they might
                            obtain a better reading on the military's real hopes and needs. After
                            all, it is argued, our military training program has been regarded as
                            the most vital part of our Indonesian assistance in terms of future
                            pay-off. If Nasution and Co. were to ask us to lie low for a while, it
                            would be quite possible to taper off on military aid while continuing
                            the civic action programs with considerably reduced staff under the wing
                            of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. (This proposal has been
                            discussed with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and Poats is
                            favorably inclined.)</p>
                        <p>4. As between these two courses, I would push for the Defense
                            alternative. In terms of priorities, I would assume that our No. 1
                            objective is to keep our foot in the door for the long term stakes, but
                            that a close second is to keep up our relationship with the Indo
                            military if at all possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">On August 24
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> informed

                                was really needed at the Tuesday lunch, according to <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName>, was “for LBJ simply to say
                                ‘let's not let things go from bad to worse with Indonesia. We don't

                                Cables and Memos, 5/64–8/64, [2 of 2])</note> In this regard, then,
                            any fast motion toward a cut-off would be a foolish waste of 15 years'
                            investment. Far better to play it cool, as long as the issue is
                            reasonably quiescent in this country, and to make a fast pitch to our
                            real pals, the Indo military—and then to determine what line, if any,

                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur generally in the substance of the
                            draft memorandum. However, they do not consider that Indonesian [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            should be terminated completely at this time. In spite of President

                            suspended, but [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not

                            policy.</p>
                        <p>3. In reviewing the draft memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff took into
                            consideration the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Contacts maintained between US and Indonesian military personnel have
                            been beneficial from an intelligence gathering aspect, as well as for
                            maintaining US influence among the Indonesian military leaders.
                            Desirably, this link should be continued insofar as practicable.</p>
                        <p>b. The major military implications which might be associated with further
                            deterioration of US/Indonesian relations are set forth in the Appendix
                                hereto.<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">Attached but not printed.</note>
                            Briefly, the principal military implication for the United States is the
                            adverse effect on US military posture in Southeast Asia which could
                            result from Indonesian reaction to a change in US policy. This could
                            require the United States to undertake deterrent action or emergency
                            evacuation of US citizens and certain allied nationals. <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0180"/>Even if such actions involved minimum
                            force deployments, re- sources committed could affect other deployments,
                            including those being considered to meet the situation on the Southeast
                            Asian mainland. 4. It is recommended that the Department of State be
                            advised:</p>
                        <p>a. That the Joint Chiefs of Staff concur generally in the substance of
                            the draft memorandum. The proposed course of action might prevent an
                            open diplomatic break in the face of deteriorating US/Indonesian
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>b. That the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a closely monitored
                            Indonesian [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]—should be continued for intelligence purposes and
                            for possible future influence upon key Indonesian leaders.</p>
                        <p>c. Of the military implications in paragraphs 13 through 15 of the
                            Appendix.</p>
                        <p>d. That consideration should be given to the timely notification of

                            terminate all military assistance. The program effects would actually be
                            minimal inasmuch as our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is already
                            pretty dormant: we have suspended the flow of virtually all military
                            hardware to Indonesia, and the Indos, on their part are postponing
                            further plans for military training in the U.S. What State is proposing,
                            then, is to remove the lingering ambiguity of our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> relationship by formally terminating
                            the works.</p>
                        <p>Defense (including <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>) now
                            argues that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in Indonesia should be
                            kept on the books pending a full and candid discussion between our

                            in ending our most important Indo relationship because of pique over
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s speech—at least
                            not until we have a clearer view of where the present process of

                            concur in the Defense position. It seems to me that as long as the

                            for “creative ambiguity” in our relations with as freakish and

                            Indonesia, chiefly military, but continue a few minor projects (most
                            civilian) in order to keep the door open. No new aid commitments are
                            involved, and no public determination is needed.</p>
                        <p>We are on a sharp downward curve in US/Indo relations, largely because of
                            the continued threat to “crush” Malaysia and our necessary opposition to
                            it. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has now adopted a
                            far more overtly anti-US line, which makes holding up further aid
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the very fact that we're on a slippery slope makes it
                            all the more important not to burn all our bridges to Indonesia: (1)
                            with Vietnam and Laos already on our Southeast Asia plate, we can ill
                            afford a major crisis with Indonesia too just now; (2) we ought to keep
                            a few links, however tenuous, to the Indo military, still the chief hope
                            of blocking a Communist takeover; (3) there's still a slim chance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> drawing back from
                            a full-fledged push on Malaysia, and we want to keep dangling the
                            prospect of renewed aid; and (4) we do not want to be the ones who
                            trigger a major attack on U.S. investments there. So we urge you approve

                            and work toward a quiet mutual agreement that will probably entail at

                        <p>This memorandum provides the rationale for a number of decisions tending
                            to reduce our assistance programs for Indonesia but seeking to retain
                            the programs still regarded as useful. These decisions can be carried
                            out without any formal determination under the Foreign Assistance Act,
                            which we continue to believe should be avoided.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Facts Bearing on the Situation</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> recognized North
                            Viet-Nam on August 10. On August 17, Indonesia stepped up confrontation
                            of Malaysia with a small (and apparently ineffectual) landing on the
                            mainland north of Singapore. Most basically, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s August 17 anniversary
                            speech was strongly and explicitly anti-American and placed Indonesia on
                            the side of the Asian Communists in a series of issues. It represented
                            the most systematic, although not the most strident, expression of our
                            growing differences with Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>2. These Indonesian actions, as a matter of foreign policy alone, would
                            make it wise to adjust our aid policy. The Indonesians have interpreted
                            our statements of support for Malaysia as expressions of hostility
                            towards Indonesia, and this has undoubtedly been one reason for their
                            behavior. However, its roots go deeper, and the fact is that we are, at
                            least for the time being, moving toward a different and lower level of
                            relationships with Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>3. From the domestic standpoint, the Tower Amendment cutting off aid to
                            Indonesia, with no Presidential discretion, will probably be dropped if
                            and when the foreign aid bill goes to conference. We would not plan to
                            disclose the present decisions to Congressional leaders as it now looks,
                            but it might become useful to have the story available if it were
                            required.</p>
                        <p>4. At the same time, we should seek to avoid drastic or highly publicized
                            actions. These would tend to stimulate possibly violent Indonesian
                            reactions that would go much further than we now wish to go in cutting
                            off our aid programs, and more specifically, that would seriously
                            endanger our major oil and rubber private investments in Indonesia.
                            Basically, our programs are now largely at the point where they maintain
                            valuable ties with key Indonesian groups but do not bolster <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> or his Malaysian policy.
                            Moreover, despite his recent actions, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has not gone over to any sustained military
                            offensive against Malaysia and there is still a possibility of a
                            negotiated settlement probably through an Afro-Asian commission. Thus,
                            we believe we can continue to sustain to Congressional leaders the
                            argument that it is not <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0185"/>in our
                            interest to make a Presidential determination one way or the other as to
                            our aid programs as a whole.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Aid Actions Proposed</p>
                        <p>1. We can now take the following definitive negative actions:</p>
                        <p>a. Decide not to ship any further major military assistance equipment, at
                            least for the present. Arms and ammunition had already been eliminated
                            last fall, and the major pending item affected would be about $8 million
                            already funded to buy communications equipment for a basic army network
                            connecting the major islands. This equipment would have been supplied
                            under a longstanding commitment and would not have contributed to
                            Indonesian capabilities in Borneo. We would now tell the Indonesians
                            that delivery was being deferred, and—which is true—that we may well
                            have a valid US operational requirement to ship it to Thailand instead.
                            The shutdown would then be complete in this area except for about
                            $100,000 per quarter of spare parts for automotive and other equipment
                            that we believe is playing no significant part in Borneo or other
                            anti-Malaysian operations.</p>
                        <p>b. Decide not to ship any further military-type equipment and supplies to
                            the National Police, including the Mobile Brigade. We have since October
                            1963 cut off arms and ammunition to these units also, but limited
                            quantities of vehicles and communications equipment had remained in the
                            program. These would now be completely withheld.</p>
                        <p>c. Decide not to furnish any further overhaul for the Indonesian C–130's
                            purchased commercially under a license granted in 1960. We are now
                            overhauling one C–130 in Georgia, and the effect of this decision would
                            be to stop the overhaul program with the completion of this aircraft,
                            with the result that the C–130's would become progressively useless.
                            They are clearly relevant to Indonesian military capabilities against
                            Malaysia, and the British have been particularly sensitive to our
                            actions in this area.</p>
                        <p>d. Consider no new PL 480 Title I and Title IV commitments.</p>
                        <p>2. The military training program is a particularly sensitive problem and
                            was singled out for attack in the Senate debate on the Tower Amendment.
                            We have felt that it was an important link to the Indonesian military,
                            and this long-term asset value is still considerable. On the other hand,
                            there are strong signs that Indonesia is slowing down, if not stopping,

                            find out what the Indonesian reaction is to this problem and how they
                            plan to handle it. If they are in fact shutting down or eliminating it,
                            we would necessarily go along and let the program find its own level
                            through quiet mutual agreement. At the same time, we would try to avoid
                            any categorical “do you or don't you” approach to Sukarno himself or any
                            senior civilian official since <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0186"/>to do so might invite wider Indonesian action affecting programs below
                            that we wish to keep.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to whatever military training would be preserved under
                            paragraph 2, we would be continuing, and would wish to continue unless
                            the Indonesians say otherwise, the following programs.</p>
                        <p>a. Non-military training and support for the Indonesian armed forces
                            under the civic action program conducted by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>b. Continuation of the malaria eradication program, which is basically
                            humanitarian and also affects the health of neighboring areas.</p>
                        <p>c. Continuation of technical assistance, non-military training, and
                            supply of non-sensitive equipment for the National Police including the
                            Mobile Brigade, to preserve US influence in this important power
                            center.</p>
                        <p>d. Provision of instrument landing equipment for Djakarta's airfield,
                            provided that Indonesia permits continued US flag use at the field. This
                            is a valid form of assistance to international civilian air traffic.
                            However, Indonesia would have to terminate the current union boycott of
                            Pan American.</p>
                        <p>e. Civilian technical assistance and training programs at roughly current
                            (and fairly extensive) levels.</p>
                        <p>f. Completion of existing Eximbank loans for thermal and fertilizer
                            plants, and granting of a pending $5 million credit for cotton
                            purchases.</p>
                        <p>g. Continued availability of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title
                            I sales covered by the general existing 3-year commitment, provided that
                            Indonesia can meet the criteria of normal market purchases and an
                            acceptable exchange rate. In practice, there is no possibility of
                            Indonesia meeting these conditions except—and even this is remote for
                            the rest of the year—with respect to $8 million of cotton.</p>
                        <p>h. Continue to negotiate terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            local currency loan agreements under previous sales agreements, but
                            delay signature pending further political appraisal; and Title II and
                            Title III <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 assistance where it
                            provides for humanitarian programs of disaster relief and voluntary
                            agency programs for children and the needy.</p>
                        <p>i. Continuation of present gradual phasing out of air transport, maritime
                            training, and navigational aid programs through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. These are small in scale.</p>
                        <p>j. Continuation of Peace Corps activity.</p>

                        <p>1590. For Ambassador from Secretary. You will have seen another telegram
                            about our reaction to Indonesian paratroop drop on Malaysia and our
                            readiness to support Malaysia in the Security Council<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">In telegram 200 to Kuala Lumpur, September 2,
                                repeated to London, the Department suggested that, if the reports of
                                Indonesia paratroopers landings in Johore and five sites on the west
                                coast between Malacca and Singapore were confirmed, such action
                                would meet the prerequisite of markedly stepped up hostilities
                                necessary for a successful initiative by Malaysia with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. These actions were
                                not the “ambiguous, desultory infiltrations in North Borneo” of the
                                past. (Ibid.)</note> but it is my impression that if the Malaysians
                            come in with a strong case and good evidence, including such things as
                            interrogation results, it will be hard for Security Council members to
                            accept Indonesian action.</p>
                        <p>I am somewhat concerned about nature of British discussion of retaliation
                            in the event that Security Council action is unsatisfactory. I am not
                            now referring to Mountbatten's<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Earl
                                Mountbatten of Burma, Chief of the British Defense Staff.</note>
                            suggestion of a small commando-type raid to capture some prisoners but
                            rather <persName corresp="#p_SDE1">Duncan Sandys</persName>' discussion
                            of air strikes, etc. A cooling off period would make it more difficult
                            to get support internationally for such retaliation. Further,
                                Thorneycroft's<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">Peter Thorneycroft,
                                British Minister of Defense.</note> comment to Acheson<note n="5" xml:id="d68fn5">Dean Acheson, former Secretary of State, January
                                1949–January 1953.</note> that British will wish to avoid anything
                            that might escalate would seem to impose very severe limitations upon
                            the nature of any such retaliation.</p>
                        <p>There is one point you should be very clear about in your discussions of
                            such matters with British Ministers. We cannot give them a blank check
                            and pick up the tab for escalation by the use of US forces without the
                            fullest and most precise understanding between Heads of Government. If
                            this is what they have in mind, they must not take anything for granted
                            in an area where we have our hands full and with a minimum of allied
                            participation. I would suppose that if the British are contemplating
                            overt retaliation involving such things as air strikes or the shelling
                            of shore installation in Indonesia that would necessarily mean the
                            movement of substantial additional British forces into the area. Even
                            though the Gulf of Tonkin is not a parallel to this particular problem,
                            I remind you for use with British Ministers that the US immediately sent
                            powerful reinforcements to the Far East to <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0188"/>deal with the consequences of any effort by Hanoi or
                            Peiping to escalate. In other words, the US cannot accept the idea that
                            the British handling of this problem is on the basis of a limited
                            liability. They must back up their actions with a readiness on their
                            part to meet the consequences. If they want us involved, they must find
                            out whether that is possible and, again, take nothing for granted.<note n="6" xml:id="d68fn6">In telegram 1082 from London, September 3,

                        <p>The Indo-Malaysian affair is heating up. At <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> urging, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            is going to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for a condemnatory
                            resolution. We've promised our <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0189"/>support. The British, however, also talk about retaliatory action.
                            Here we're more dubious, since if this affair escalates we'll probably
                            have to bail them out. We have enough wars already in Southeast Asia, so
                            you might seek to cool <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> down via <persName>Jones</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. He should impress on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that you cannot quite understand why the Indos
                            have suddenly taken the tack they have. We've tried ever since
                            Indonesia's independence in 1947 to be as helpful as we can. Indeed no
                            country has done more.</p>
                        <p>2. Thus you were deeply disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s speech of August 17. He and other Indo leaders
                            have told us for years that the ultimate threat to Indonesia was from
                            China. So it's doubly hard for us to grasp why, at the very time when
                            we're carrying the whole burden of protecting Southeast Asia from the
                            Chicoms, Sukarno should seem to embrace the Chicoms and declare war on
                            the US. Surely you said nothing when the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> was here comparable to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s outburst.</p>
                        <p>3. We tried in every quiet way to explain to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that he'd lose our support
                            if he decided to beat up Malaysia. You personally sent the Attorney

                        <p>4. You still hope for a peaceful settlement. It is better to talk than
                            fight. You also are just as anxious to have good relations with a key
                            country like Indonesia and a key leader like <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as was President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>. But <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> must realize where we stand
                            in event Malaysia is attacked.</p>

                        <p>“As you know, we have been urgently considering with the Malaysian

                            Malaysian Cabinet, however, a strong and understandable demand emerged
                            that as a condition of Malaysia referring her difficulties to the
                            Security Council we should give an assurance of our agreement in
                            principle to take some kind of action against Indonesia on Indonesian
                                soil.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">Also on September 4, Australian

                                in the event the action in the Security Council failed. <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> stated he was consulting the

                                treaty. <persName>Bundy</persName> stressed the need for close
                                consultation, especially in light of the <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> relationship, but warned <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> that Australia should not
                                assume that the United States would become involved if the
                                escalation took place. (Circular telegram 441, September 4; National

                        </p>
                        <p>Since our major concern was to persuade Malaysia to go to the Security
                            Council without delay, we had no option but to agree to some assurance,
                            if not exactly on the lines requested, and the High Commissioner has
                            accordingly informed the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            that the British Government agree in principle that any further act of
                            aggression by Indonesia upon the territory of Malaya or Singapore (i.e.
                            excluding confrontation operations in Borneo), should be met by a
                            counter attack against some appropriate objective on Indonesian
                            territory. He added that we consider it absolutely essential that,
                            before any such counter attack is made, the Malaysian Government should
                            take the matter to the Security Council and seek their moral support
                            against Indonesian aggression, and went on to say that, having once
                            raised the matter in the Security Council it would probably not be
                            necessary to do so again in the event of a fresh act of aggression, when
                            counter action could follow.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that although this message sets out in unequivocable
                            terms our willingness and determination to defend Malaya and Singapore
                            in the only practicable way open to us against further attacks of this
                            kind, we have insisted on a reference to the Security Council first. We
                            are not thinking about tactics for this debate and, as you know, our
                            officials are in close touch.”</p>

                        <p>Am keeping a close eye on likely <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/Malaysian countermoves to Indo para-drop. This affair could

                            “agreed” to Malay request for a retaliatory strike against an Indo base

                        <p>Meanwhile pattern of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> naval movements
                            looks like a most provocative show of force. First <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> move through Sunda Strait was well before
                            para-drop. Now we hear another carrier and seven destroyers just went
                            through. Now Brits (who have 3 CVAs in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>) say their first squadron will return through Sunda straits
                            on 12 September. The Indos are obviously at sixes and sevens, and we
                            fear a <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-type reaction
                            any time. <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> session is also likely
                            to produce some Indo fireworks.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">M. Green</persName> thinks Brits would like
                            to provoke a nice mess, into which we'd necessarily be sucked. I too
                            regard this as likely, though I grant alternative explanation that Brits
                            think a show of force will deter Indos. If they're operating on latter
                            assumption, however, I think they're wrong again. The reaction of a
                            Nasser or <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has always
                            been to escalate rather than back down.</p>
                        <p>Key point is that we don't really know what Brits have in mind. Since our
                            oil and other assets in Indonesia are inevitably at stake, we ought to
                            buy a seat at this table. More important yet, how many wars do we want

                            <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> had said it would be
                            calamity if British took action against Indonesia involving Australia on
                            which US had not been consulted in advance, and therefore suggesting
                            that US propose “combined military contingency consultations” to
                            British, “believing as we do that proposal would not be rejected.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> stated that Australians
                            had been talking very directly with British in London to ascertain what
                            action they might have in mind in reference Malaysia, and that it seemed
                            urgently necessary there be ways to find out and share British thinking,
                            both with US and Australia, as well as New Zealand. At later point he
                            made clear that American suggestion to British would be to “share our
                            thinking” and did not envisage actual joint military planning.<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">In telegram 1837 to London, September 12, the
                                Department reported to the Embassy that the British Embassy had
                                informed the Department that the British Far East command had
                                produced a tentative list of seven potential targets for retaliation
                                based on four criteria. Those criteria were that the target must be
                                related to the Indonesia attack, must be militarily useful, would
                                produce minimum casualties, and be least likely to produce
                                escalation. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary responded he saw no real danger, in light Indonesian actions
                            and attitudes expressed in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debate,
                            that there would be any sharp public difference in attitude between US
                            and other nations involved. However, he did think there could be grave
                            difficulty if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> started something on
                            assumption US would step in. We could not accept residual responsibility
                            in situation where others had taken action on basis of limited
                            liability. He had therefore been glad to see that British were taking
                            reinforcing steps in Far East, and, although he would not say so
                            publicly, we in fact approved withdrawal of some <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops from NATO for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> responded that <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> Treaty in fact did commit US to
                            measure of residual liability where Australian and New Zealand forces
                            were involved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary answered this was not what he meant by residual
                            responsibility—our respective obligations under <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> Treaty were the same <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0194"/>and we had need to consider under
                            treaty just what Australians had done to carry out their obligations. As
                            an example of what he meant by “residual” responsibility, Secretary
                            cited Dutch attempt have us commit our forces in West New Guinea dispute
                            even though Dutch themselves were not prepared send additional forces.
                            He also alluded to Congo case, where Spaak's effort enlist participation
                            of six Common Market nations had met with “colossal indifference.” He
                            said US simply could not accept such situations where others did not
                            take strong measures to carry out their share of responsibility. He said
                            this was his main point and that it must be clearly understood by
                            Australians and others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then noted that conflict with Indonesia could become major
                            shooting war, and that we for our part, once serious shooting started in
                            such case, would consider it necessary to make substantial deployments
                            and possibly even mobilization. <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> thought it unlikely Indonesian situation would
                            reach point of major conflict, but did believe it possible that more
                            “acts of folly” on Indonesian side could lead to degree escalation that
                            would involve Australians and thus bring into question US
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary then referred to message just received from London that Peck of
                            British FonOff was proposing early conference between US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, and New Zealand, and that
                            Peck had specifically suggested <persName>Bundy</persName>'s visit to
                            London next week might be appropriate occasion for this.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted his schedule would bring him to
                            London Friday, 18th, but might conceivably be advanced to Thurs, 17th,
                            and this might be good timing. He threw out suggestion any such talks
                            should be held only on basis no publicity whatever and in lowest
                            possible key.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">In telegram 1909 to London,
                                September 15, the Department indicated that “any identifiable
                                four-power meeting” by <persName>Bundy</persName> during his London
                                visit would inevitably lead to distorted leaks and would associate
                                the United States with subsequent British action. Instead
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> should meet with British Foreign
                                Office officials and then have a “quiet drink” with Australian and
                                New Zealand representatives. (Ibid.) Reports of
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>'s meetings in London are in telegrams
                                1308 and 1309 from London, both September 18, and memoranda of
                                conversation are in airgram A–721 from London, September 24. (Ibid.)
                                See also <ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note> We were in
                            fact in position where British had primary action responsibility and we
                            in US were being more nearly informed than consulted, although
                            Australians were perhaps nearer to being consulted than informed and—as
                                <persName corresp="#p_WJK1">Waller</persName> noted—had clear
                            obligation consult us before any action involving their forces.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted danger that any publicized
                            consultation might both have undesirable effect on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and, perhaps even more
                            serious, appear to bind participants to whatever British might then
                            decide to do, whether or not others had in fact agreed to it.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>Secretary noted that apart from any such specific consultation, there was
                            continuing problem of obtaining adequate information on British thinking
                            about additional military moves. He said we had in mind assigning
                            appropriate Embassy officer in London to this function and that this
                            might be worked out at same time, or perhaps even prior to any actual
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>It was left that US side would consider further just how to take up
                            Australian suggestion, but that we recognized need for machinery that
                            would give us clear understanding of British thinking but that would not
                            involve actual participation in anything like joint military
                            planning.</p>

                                    <persName>Jones</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> told him that he wanted

                            he unable or unwilling recognize that existing situation is different
                            from and far more serious than situation before Indos put forces into
                            Malaya and publicly boasted they had done so. In Bogor meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> or soonest
                            thereafter you should make following points, stating you doing so on
                            instruction if you think this desirable:</p>
                        <p>1) By using force against Malaya, boasting about it and anticipating that
                            they would continue (as Sudjarwo had done in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>) Indos have created new situation which they must
                            recognize as such.</p>
                        <p>2) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> must be aware that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> cannot indefinitely tolerate Indo military action
                            against Malaysia and that Indo actions, if continued, may lead to
                            situation where Sukarno finds himself in real hostilities with
                            Commonwealth. If this happens, given history of situation, <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0196"/>he cannot expect <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to help him. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: If you think <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> believes we can or will restrain British, he
                            should be disabused of any such idea. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>3) We are glad he is willing resume negotiations, but believe it totally
                            unrealistic expect <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> will be willing
                            or able negotiate in present atmosphere. First essential is that Indos
                            stop military action, and we cannot work to encourage further
                            negotiation until this happens.</p>
                        <p>4) On other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            genuinely wants to settle this issue peacefully he must find way to stop
                            military action. If he does so, we will be glad to resume our previous
                            policy of encouraging solution through negotiation.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">In telegram 542 from Djakarta, September 15,

                        <p>1. Indonesian Objectives. Recent Indonesian paramilitary landings in
                            Malaya are part of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            long-range campaign to break up Malaysia and oust the British from their
                            military bases there. The mission of the 150 or so infiltrators includes
                            sabotage and terrorism, guerrilla recruitment and training, and the
                            setting up of guerrilla redoubts in Malaya's jungles and highlands. Such
                            raids will almost certainly continue. In the long run, through repeated
                            infiltrations of this sort, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> hopes to build up a revolutionary potential
                            sufficient to overthrow the moderate, pro-Western government of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. In the short run, the infiltrations are designed to heighten local
                            insecurity, shake the faith of the Malaysian people in their government,
                            weaken their determination to resist Indonesia, and thus to increase the
                            pressures on the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to
                            negotiate the dispute on Indonesian terms. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> hopes that by forcing the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and its Commonwealth allies to
                            spread their available forces ever more thinly he will wear down their
                            ability and determination to carry on the struggle. He also seeks to
                            undermine Malaysian confidence in the British will and ability to
                            provide protection.</p>
                        <p>3. The British Response. Commonwealth forces have responded to the
                            Indonesian moves defensively, attempting to round up the infiltrators;
                            about one-half have been killed or captured to date. Both the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australia are deploying additional
                            army, navy, and air units to the general area. The Malaysians and
                            British have also taken the issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council, seeking condemnation of Indonesia, but
                            it is unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will act so as
                            to satisfy them or prevent further Indonesian infiltrations. The British
                            are now planning retaliation against any further infiltrations by
                            attacks on the bases from which they are launched. The British are
                            concerned that failure to respond forcefully to the landings in Malaya
                            will only encourage the Indonesians to expand their paramilitary
                            activities. They see the alternatives as either a sharp retaliatory blow
                            or a constantly rising insurgency and unrest in Malaya.</p>
                        <p>4. It is probable that further Indonesian infiltrations of Malaya or
                            Singapore will precipitate a British retaliatory attack against nearby
                            Indonesian guerrilla bases. The Indonesians would react to such an
                            attack with vehement denunciations, seeking to establish justification
                            for their position—perhaps even in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—that the “aggressive” British constitute the real threat to
                            peace in the area. For a time, they would probably be somewhat more
                            cautious in paramilitary operations in Malaya. They would want to show,
                            however, that retaliation had not affected their confrontation policy,
                            and they would not, in our opinion, slow down insurgency operations in
                            Borneo or discontinue them entirely in Malaya. On balance, we believe,
                            however, that they <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0198"/>would
                            probably avoid an overt military response in kind against Malaysia, for
                            fear of triggering a war with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            which they have long sought to avoid and in which they would suffer
                            great damage. However, what Indonesia would do in this case depends upon
                            the will of one man, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>;
                            we cannot be sure that he would not decide that, in the circumstances,
                            raising the pitch of the war would be to his advantage.</p>
                        <p>5. Should there be an escalation of overt hostilities between Indonesia
                            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/Malaysia, the Soviets and the
                            Chinese Communists would of course support Indonesia with extensive
                            propaganda and diplomatic activity. We think it virtually certain,
                            however, that neither power would intervene with military force.</p>
                        <p>6. The Sunda Strait. The situation was complicated for a time by the
                            passage of a British naval task force southward through the Sunda Strait
                            (between Java and Sumatra) on 27 August without providing the type of
                            prior notification which has long been requested by Indonesia with
                            regard to movement of warships through waters it claims to be
                            territorial. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, and the
                            US normally comply with this procedure “as a courtesy.” The same British
                            force—the aircraft carrier Victorious and two destroyers—was tentatively
                            scheduled to retransit the Strait northbound, and the Indonesians
                            threatened to oppose its movement with armed force. The Indonesians,
                            however, informed the British that the Sunda Strait area would be closed
                            from 10 September to 10 October for their own “naval maneuvers,” and
                            they indicated they would not object if the British proceeded by the
                            Lombok Strait (east of Java, between Bali and Lombok). This the British
                            agreed to do and the threatened crisis subsided. The issue has not been
                            settled, however, and it is almost certain to be revived, since the
                            Indonesian objective clearly is to establish the principle of Indonesian
                            control of all waters within and leading into the Indonesian
                            archipelago.</p>

                        <p>1. During the past two months there has been a steady increasing strain
                            in relations between Indonesia and the U.S. The Indonesian attitude has
                            crystalized in the face of a number of recent developments. These
                            include repeated indications of unilateral withdrawal by the U.S. of our
                            remaining aid program, culminating of course in the passage of the Tower

                            <note n="7" xml:id="d76fn7">See <ref target="#d59fn2">footnote 2,

                            public enemy number one in Asia, and identified himself more explicitly
                            than ever before with the Communist Bloc. Internally the trend to the
                            left has matched <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            international posture. By calling for the re-tooling of “reactionary”
                            officials up to the Menko level, the President virtually invited the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to advocate re-tooling of all
                            anti-Communists <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0200"/>in the
                            government. While announcing that he would dissolve any reactionary
                            political party, he has at the same time given tacit approval for the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s unilateral action campaign. In
                            his speech <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> endorsed
                            emphatically the land reform program and the establishment of the land
                            reform courts, which for all practical purposes will be controlled by
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> thru Astrawinata. He not only
                            proclaimed the ultimate end of “imperialist capital” in Indonesia, a
                            primary objective of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, but
                            declared also that anyone who opposes Nasakom opposes the revolution.
                            Although in his latest cabinet reshuffle (27 August) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not go all the way
                            toward Nasakomization, there can be no question that he went a step
                            further in legitimizing the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s role
                            in the executive branch of his government. These developments have of
                            course been matched by repeated slaps at the U.S., including the
                            postponement of military and police training, the Pan American boycott,
                            the action against <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in
                            Djogdjakarta, and the general threat to American property.</p>
                        <p>3. Notwithstanding this rather grim picture, there are indications that
                            the situation is by no means beyond redress. Words of encouragement
                            continue to be received by various components of the U.S. Mission from
                            close contacts, sources of information, and friends in general. There
                            are good men in government, the armed services and the private sector,
                            who are willing to work for the things they believe in, even if it means
                            endangering their livelihood and personal security. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] continues to
                            find it possible to work effectively with such individuals, and their
                            motivation is by no means confined to the pursuit of money. Among them
                            some have already demonstrated a capability for limited but effective
                            clandestine political action. There have been, moreover, numerous
                            approaches to the Embassy and to other Mission components by
                            individuals—some self-seekers, but others altruistically motivated—who
                            seek assistance to enable them to fight communism in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>4. Time, however, is not on the side of these people, as the ground
                            beneath them is being eroded at a rapidly accelerating rate. Perhaps it
                            cannot be stopped. Certainly a covert program alone cannot reverse the
                            trend. The Embassy, in its recommendations to the Department, has posed
                            a number of considerations, which are in effect aimed at maintaining a
                            foothold in Indonesia under conditions that might enable us to outlast
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Within the
                            context of the basic mission program and as a supplement thereto, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            proposes an intensified covert action program, limited in its objective
                            initially, but designed for expansion if circumstances permit.</p>
                        <p>5. The objectives of a covert program would entail initially the adoption
                            of an active interest in Indonesian internal political developments. The
                            immediate goal would be to build up strength among <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0201"/>non-communist and anti-communist groups
                            and organizations. The program would be two-pronged, on the one hand
                            designed to flex the muscles of the “good” elements, at the same time
                            encouraging direct action against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as a party. Small scale harassment efforts would be
                            orchestrated and momentum developed. A case can be made to show that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is susceptible to
                            pressure and sensitive to certain types of public opinion. The
                            unfortunate thing is that the Indonesian right wing has in effect lost
                            its nerve and abandoned the fight to the communists. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has exploited the situation and
                            brainwashed both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            a large portion of the population. It is necessary therefore to
                            demonstrate to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> the
                            existence of an active anti-communist sector which is clearly not yet
                            willing to be written off.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow paragraphs 6–14, which contain an outline of a five-phased
                            program and an assessment of [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>].]</p>
                        <p>15. Present U.S. policy toward Indonesia has been essentially
                            constructive and forward-looking, predicated on the concept of
                            contributing to Indonesia's economic development. In the face of an
                            increasingly leftward drift on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, matched by an increasingly stronger communist voice in
                            Indonesian affairs, we have sought to maintain our equity here until the
                            advent of better times. Within this framework the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] covert
                            action program has been limited. Modest efforts have been made to
                            develop points of contact and influence [<hi rend="italic">1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. There has been moderate emphasis
                            on the development [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] among potential leader types. And finally,
                            the program has entailed limited harassment of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. There has, of course, been no
                            authorization for direct attacks on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The level of permissible risk-taking has
                            naturally been very low and confined almost entirely to the realm of
                            intelligence collection.</p>
                        <p>16. Certain of the activities suggested in paragraphs 5–11 above could be
                            undertaken in the framework of the existing policy. If, however, a
                            serious effort were to be undertaken along such lines, a number of
                            significant questions would first have to be weighed very carefully. It
                            would have to be understood at the outset that the purpose of the entire
                            exercise is agitation and the instigation of internal strife between
                            communist and non-communist elements. While the pattern of activity
                            proposed is relatively modest in scope, the measure of the success of
                            the program would in effect be the momentum it acquired. This would mean
                            a widening of its scope and an intensification of its pace. Thus even a
                            modest beginning effort would carry within itself the essence of more
                            critical policy questions. Just how far can we go in attempting to split
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and, more important, to pit the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> against non-communist elements,
                            particularly the Army? To what extent, if any, should we attack
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>? Is it
                            unthinkable to foment internal tensions such as <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0202"/>gave rise to the Chinese riots of last
                            year, and which under certain conditions might force the Army to assume
                            broad powers in restoring order? We do not wish to appear overly
                            ambitious in this connection. If, however, we are to develop a program
                            entailing forms of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] as a supplement to long-term political
                            development, it is imperative that we know where we are going and that
                            we be able to weigh the possible consequences of our efforts. The time
                            to answer these questions is now, not later. To undertake action even on
                            the modest scale outlined above without first studying these questions
                            and commitments they might entail would result in action for its own
                            sake. It would be far better to stand pat, without the risk of
                            embarrassment or hazard [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>17. If there appears to be an element of incompatibility in such a
                            melding of destructive action with long-term efforts to breathe life
                            into the nobler elements of Indonesian society, we can only argue that
                            in the long term there may be little left here to save. The current
                            combination of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            tough dictatorship coupled with an increasingly effective brainwashing
                            of all local population elements, plus the skilled <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> exploitation of legitimate Indonesian
                            nationalism, and lastly the inbred Javanese tradition of acquiescence
                            before authority, will surely result in elimination of the remaining
                            barriers between communists in this country and those who would resist
                            them.</p>
                        <p>18. Perhaps the most important of all, we believe it essential to make a
                            substantial effort to combat growing <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            domination in the propaganda field (press, radio and TV). Inasmuch as
                            the current <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> propaganda line and that
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime are
                            virtually indistinguishable, this would entail an obvious risk. We
                            believe this risk must be taken.</p>

                            held in London with United Kingdom, Australian, and New Zealand
                            representatives on military contingency planning in the event of further
                            Indonesian landings of paratroops or seaborne infiltrators in mainland
                            Malaya and Singapore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that there had been general
                            agreement among the participants in the London discussions to hold
                            meetings as often as necessary in Washington in the interests of
                            preserving the inconspicuous character of contacts on this subject. We
                            understand that Prime Minister Douglas Home is continuing his exchange
                            of views with Australian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> and New Zealand Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HSK1">Holyoake</persName> on the whole subject of
                            possible action against Indonesia and that these exchanges have not been
                            completed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> noted that
                            the instructions sent out by the British Government to Lord Head in
                            Singapore were based on a distinction between the initial phase of
                            response to further Indonesian landings, when British and Malaysian
                            forces would take action against Indonesian intruders, and a secondary
                            phase, when Australian and New Zealand units would be required. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> added that he understood plans for
                            British retaliation against Indonesia were also divided into two phases:
                            first, attacks would be directed against selected, nearby bases for
                            infiltrators and, secondly, in the event of Indonesian air strikes
                            against Butterworth or Singapore, for example, against Indonesian air
                            bases from which the attacking aircraft fly. The British military, he
                            continued, told him they have made a careful evaluation of Indonesian
                            offensive action with the resources presently available in Malaysia. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> concluded that he had told the Foreign
                            Office that he thought the British plans were not unreasonable.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0204"/>
                        <p>Internal Situation in Indonesia. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> went on
                            to review the situation in Indonesia as we see it. We think we see at
                            least temporary indications that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is trying to restrain the Indonesian Communist
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). Admittedly, we have thought
                            we saw such signs before, but this proved illusory. However, there are
                            some recent indications that the Indonesians realize how close they came
                            to a showdown. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName> said
                            we believe there have been two recent developments of particular
                            importance which encourage the Indonesian Government to adopt a more
                            peaceful stance. The Indonesians were disagreeably surprised by the
                            results of the recent vote in the Security Council, where two African
                            countries (Morocco and Ivory Coast) voted against them. Since the vote
                            Morocco and Ceylon and perhaps other Afro-Asians have told the
                            Indonesians that they cannot agree with the Indonesian contention that
                            Indonesia has a right to attack its neighbors, and Prime Minister
                            Shastri of India has stated much the same thing publicly. We also
                            suspect that the Soviets have had some hard words to say to the
                            Indonesians since the Soviet veto of the Norwegian resolution in the
                            Security Council cut right across current Soviet efforts to condemn the
                            use of military force to settle disputes between nations. Internally,
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has been forcing the pace on the
                            Indonesian Government, and this was bringing out a reaction in various
                            forms. In addition, what amounts to martial law has been proclaimed
                            throughout the country, giving the Army authority to hold down strikes
                            and demonstrations. However, we won't know until <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> returns from his current
                            trip what his reading of the situation will be or what the Soviet price
                            will be for further support of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM12">Stewart</persName> left a copy of an
                            analysis of the situation prepared by the British Embassy in Djakarta
                            September 23.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Not found attached.</note> The
                            Embassy concluded that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is undecided about the path to take and is
                            groping his way, acutely worried that he may have to make an irrevocable
                            decision one way or another in the near future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> doubted that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would get anything
                            substantial from his visit to Moscow. The Soviets do not appear ready to
                            move into Southeast Asia in strength, and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has nothing much to offer
                            them in return. In any case, the argument for positioning Commonwealth
                            forces to deal firmly with further Indonesian incursions into mainland
                            Malaya and Singapore remains untouched, and the existence of these
                            forces in place has had a salutary effect on the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>Reascertainment in Malaysian Borneo. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said
                            that Mr. Peck of the Foreign Office had told him in London that the
                            British have carefully examined the idea reportedly floated by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that a plebiscite <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0205"/>on the formation of Malaysia
                            might be held in Borneo in the next five years. The British have
                            concluded that this would amount to holding a Sword of Damocles over the
                            Tunku. The situation was not like that in West Irian, where the
                            Indonesians are committed to a referendum before 1969, but where they
                            can manage political activity on the referendum issue. In a more open
                            society like Malaysia the Tunku could not exert the same kind of
                            control.</p>

                            objectives with regard Indonesia continue to be to do what we can to
                            keep Indonesia out of communist control, to restrain Indo military and
                            foreign policy excesses so that they do not lead to second major
                            military conflict in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, and to get
                            through current period (probably meaning Sukarno regime at least)
                            without open break between US and Indonesia. Over past year tactics
                            employed to do these things have been based on assumption main current
                            problem—Indo-Malaysia dispute—could be negotiated out if right
                            combination found, and we have played active role in encouraging
                            participants and interested Asians to seek negotiating basis. We feel
                            this tactical approach correct. Meanwhile, however, adverse direction
                            Indonesian policies have become more clearly defined, requiring review
                            of our approach. Following is summary of our assessment of situation we
                            now face:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Perspective</p>
                        <p>For past seven years or more, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has habitually used hostility to one or another
                            foreign power as dramatic issue to unify country under his rule. His own
                            ideological makeup and historical circumstances have made it inevitable
                            that target has in virtually all cases been Western or pro-Western power
                                (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Malaysia, Netherlands, GRC, <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0206"/>etc.). This strategy, together
                            with internal balancing and manipulation rival forces, has become basic
                            tool in maintaining his regime. Thus when West Irian settlement
                            eliminated Indo's last real grievance against West, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> flirted briefly with idea of economic
                            development as next dramatic issue before dropping it for confrontation.
                            One result of this strategy has been deepening atmosphere hostility to
                            West throughout much of Indo society; friendly Indos may attempt explain
                            it away as passing phase, but fact remains present Indo environment
                            probably more hostile to West than almost any outside China and its
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>Military confrontation of Malaysia has gone through various
                            stages—guerrilla activity in Borneo, negotiations, low-level terrorism
                            on mainland, culminating in Aug-Sept 1964 attacks on mainland—but each
                            has proved more or less dramatically unsuccessful. As of early Sept,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> faced two crucial problems: (a)
                            they had brought selves to what they saw as brink of open war with
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, which they knew they could not
                            win, and (b) they recognized that despite year of proclaiming their
                            determination to crush Malaysia they had accomplished almost nothing
                            toward that end. In effort find way out of this dilemma, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> sought to mobilize support
                            in Moscow and among <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>'s at Cairo for
                            development <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-led
                            neutralist anti-imperialist front. Consensus seemed to be that he
                            failed, but it too early to be sure of this.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Situation</p>
                        <p>We have assumed that, when Indos recognized they could not crush Malaysia
                            without unacceptable damage to selves, they would be willing accept
                            tolerable settlement through face-saving device and then turn to other
                            dramatic issue to keep populace keyed up. Have been hopes that this
                            could be internal issue for a change, perhaps even economic
                            development.</p>
                        <p>Latest developments suggest this assumption may have become erroneous.
                            Rather than cutting losses and turning elsewhere, Indos seem to have
                            decided on (or perhaps drifted into) new confrontation strategy,
                            switching from narrow confrontation of Malaysia to more diffuse
                            political confrontation of entire West (i.e., Old Established Forces).
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> Aug 17 speech
                            clearly signaled this switch and Cairo conference<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">The Cairo Conference of Non-Aligned Nations, October
                                5–10, 1964.</note> seems to have formalized it. Indos would expect
                            realize number of advantages from this strategy:</p>
                        <p>(1) It overshadows Malaysia confrontation and should relieve regime of
                            need to escalate military confrontation to point where it again brings
                            grave threat British retaliation. Malaysia confrontation would continue
                            as essential element this broader confrontation but could be carried out
                            through propaganda, subversion and relatively safe Borneo guerrilla
                            campaigns.</p>
                        <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>(2) It moves Indo into much greater prominence in world scene, feeds
                            regime's self-esteem and provides much more satisfying dramatic issue
                            than increasingly tired theme of Malaysia confrontation. At same time,
                            it blunts widespread <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> disapproval of
                            rash Indo assault on fellow <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> member by
                            subordinating it to political assault on white man.</p>
                        <p>(3) It could even be manipulated into a “third force,” bringing together
                            in an Indo-dominated bloc various <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>
                            mavericks (Ghana, Cambodia, etc.) plus North Korea and North Viet-Nam,
                            thereby breaking Indo isolation and giving <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> real place in sun.</p>
                        <p>(4) At least in early stages, this strategy should be welcome to Chicoms
                            and should provide some comfort for Russians as they see threat open war
                            recede. Rewards could probably be extracted from both. Recent
                            developments such as crackdown on <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            anti-US excesses and peace feelers to <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and British might be cited as evidence to
                            contrary. This does not appear persuasive. Easing of anti-US excesses
                            more likely stems from (a) <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> fear
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> getting out of hand and (b)
                            desire not to challenge US too directly over relatively trivial issues
                            at this early stage in new game. Noteworthy that, while physical
                            pressure on US properties in Indo is abating somewhat, intense anti-US
                            brainwashing through all Indo information media apparently is continuing
                            in full force. Re peace feelers, demonstration of continued Indo desire
                            for peaceful settlement with Malaysia also compatible with new strategy
                            in that it improves Indo world image and helps woo <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications</p>
                        <p>If this assessment generally correct, we can anticipate following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Indos will become progressively more hostile to US as chief of
                            “Neokolim Oldefos” and to US interests both in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and throughout world, whatever policy we may pursue
                            toward them.</p>
                        <p>(2) Not wanting to unite Oldefos against them while they unite against
                            us, they may differentiate carefully in their treatment of various
                            Western countries, may increase fire on US in addition to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> while handling Australians more gently
                            and striving maintain fairly cordial (and profitable) relations with
                            Europeans, Japanese and perhaps Philippines as long as they can.</p>
                        <p>(3) While <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will
                            continue assert his willingness settle with Malaysians in <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> context and may well go through
                            negotiation motions to create peace-loving image, his real need for
                            settlement will have disappeared. Further Indo participation in
                            negotiations will thus be no more than shadow play as far as <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> concerned. No real settlement short of
                            complete Malaysian capitulation will be seriously considered. Foregoing
                            does not imply that this new Indo strategy we see emerging will be
                            immutable or necessarily permanent. Indo policy has been subject to wide
                            variations over past 15 years and undoubtedly will change again when
                            combination of internal pressures, outside pressures and rewards produce
                            Indo reassessments. We see this merely as current Indo strategy, to be
                            pursued as were past strategies until failure or changing circumstances
                            call for new one.</p>

                            becomes one aspect of broader problem of Indonesian hostility towards
                            Western presence and influence in Southeast Asia. Until this basic
                            Indonesian policy changes, Malaysia problem is essentially without
                            “solution,” i.e. re-establishment friendly relations, status quo ante,
                            or even peaceful co-existence.</p>
                        <p>Past negotiations have failed because of absence agreement between <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            on nature of their difference. For Indonesia, manner of Malaysia's
                            formation, its internal political and social structure, and its
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are completely
                            unacceptable. Malaysia is therefore given Hobson's choice of negotiating
                            its own dissolution or suffering it at hands Indonesian “volunteers.”
                            Malaysia, for its part, is prepared to negotiate when Indonesia in fact
                            recognizes its political independence and territorial integrity. This
                            however, as Indonesia has repeatedly and explicitly proclaimed, is basic
                            point at issue.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, negotiations, “peace feelers”, become
                            primarily if not solely maneuver to gain tactical advantage and place
                            opponent in bad light in eyes of world, particularly Asian-African
                            world. Third parties are drawn in to bring pressure on enemy to yield
                            bargaining points in interest “peaceful solution to problem.”</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>Recognizing that “solution” is for present impossible, it is still
                            clearly in our interest to divert confrontation away from dangerous
                            military course and channel it into “negotiations” or, more
                            realistically, contacts, to maximum extent possible. This can be done,
                            however, only against background credible British military deterrent
                            confronting Indonesia with unacceptable consequences of again
                            intensifying military confrontation.</p>
                        <p>For present following considerations bear on role and tactics of U.S. in
                            this problem:</p>
                        <p>1. Malaysian situation now surrounded with unusually difficult range of
                            uncertainties: a new British government; interrelation of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and new Soviet leadership; an internal
                            political situation in Indonesia where struggle for power between
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName>, and probably others, may be
                            entering new phase and manifesting itself in divergent and uncoordinated
                            approaches to Malaysian problem.</p>
                        <p>2. We must not sponsor initiatives which Indos can manipulate to their
                            advantage, or urge on Malaysia and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            damaging concessions which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can treat
                            as irrevocable commitments and a base from which further concessions are
                            exacted.</p>
                        <p>3. On other hand, we should encourage <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> to keep door open to Indo
                            approaches and to be as apparently responsive as is necessary to keep
                            some form of dialogue going in order avoid having Indos feel they frozen
                            into position where only exit from situation is military.</p>
                        <p>4. We should continue to stress to <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            importance of strong military posture in area, and necessity that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> be left in no doubt on <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            ability and willingness meet higher levels military activity.</p>
                        <p>In view foregoing we believe following best course for U.S. at this
                            point:</p>

                            spelled out from <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss>. We also recognize
                            there may be detrimental aspect of inhibiting effect presence of third
                            party might have on willingness of principals to be forthright. As to
                            mechanics of such meeting, we believe Japanese might play useful role
                            particularly as they most anxious to make contribution. If plan for such
                            meeting were held closely by high level Japanese Govt., chances for leak
                            would be minimized. No reason why <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could not openly visit Japan as he has done
                            often in past. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> might go
                            secretly, possibly being brought in by Commonwealth military aircraft.
                            Meeting could be held at secluded spot similar to Dutch-Indo discussions
                            West Irian in Virginia. With full support of Japanese arrangements of
                            this kind probably would avoid publicity. Japan might also offer an
                            “Asian Bunker” to act as mediator. Although <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> suspicious of Oda, Tunku might be persuaded accept him.
                            Another possibility would be Zafrulla Khan if were able undertake such a
                            mission while <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> justice.</p>
                        <p>Although <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> now suspicious of Pakistanis
                            because of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> attitude toward Communist
                            China, they might be convinced in view Khan stature as an international
                            figure and fact that he has not been associated with <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> recently.</p>
                        <p>This scenario illustrative and raises some problems such as willingness
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> participate in plan
                            which he may view as undignified for chief of govt. There are other
                            possibilities such as meeting in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> in July was told by London eye specialists he
                            should return for further examination in 3 or 4 months. Understand
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may go to Vienna
                            for further medical treatment in January. This could provide <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0212"/>opportunity unobtrusive meeting. Both
                            principals would have to agree to this plan well in advance to prevent
                            further deterioration in situation based on uncertainty.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>. We should indicate our
                            willingness to try to get <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> to name Thais as Phil representative on <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>. Then <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> could pick reliable <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss>
                            country, possibly Malagasy. We might also be prepared ask <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> to suggest to Thais that Japan
                            should be fourth member of commission. If Indos select Pakistan,
                            quadripartite commission would be in reasonably good shape, from US
                            standpoint. Our approach would include understanding that all parties be
                            urged as first order business to request immediate withdrawal of
                            Indonesian guerrillas from all of Malaysia and seek guarantee complete

                        <p>In further amplification of the United States position with respect to
                            the Indonesia-Malaysia problem, the Secretary said we did not want to be
                            faced with residual military responsibilities for the consequences of
                            escalation. The United States in this matter is a half pace behind those
                            countries—the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand—with direct
                            commitments. The American people are weary of the concept that the
                            United States is to be regarded as the world's gendarmes. We have
                            pointed out to Australia and New Zealand the desirability of increasing
                            their defense budgets. They have been relying too much on ANZUS and too
                            little on their own efforts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted the apparent interest of some Indonesian leaders in
                            quiet talks with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He regretted the
                            action of the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> in
                            unnecessarily complicating the situation by referring at a press
                            conference to these confidential messages from the Indonesians. The
                            Foreign Secretary replied that the British Government was examining
                            these Indonesian feelers but had to keep the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> in step and did not wish to get into the position
                            of an intermediary between Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has the mistaken idea that the oil companies
                            operating in Indonesia can be treated as hostages. As a matter of fact
                            if he were to move against the companies, the immediate consequence
                            would be the loss to Indonesia of $125,000,000 per annum in foreign
                            exchange. Indonesia's foreign exchange position is very bad with the
                            reserves some time ago down to $25,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary inquired about our assessment of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s relations with Peking.
                            The Secretary replied that while <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> privately speaks of the Chinese Communist
                            threat, the Indonesian Communist Party has swung from Moscow to
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained to the Foreign Secretary that our Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff believe it is important to continue our training contacts to the
                            extent possible with the Indonesian Army. The Foreign Secretary
                            expressed understanding of this policy but indicated concern at public
                            reaction in Britain. Lord Harlech noted that US training of Indonesians
                            in guerrilla warfare was troubling. The Secretary replied that this
                            training was being phased out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested, and the Foreign Secretary agreed, that it would
                            be a good idea to leave the Dutch free to play their own hand in dealing
                            with the Indonesians. He noted that the Dutch, whose relations with the
                            Indonesians have shown some improvement, may turn out to be the
                            principal Western influence in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed understanding of the need for a tart reply to
                            Indonesian parachute drops and landings in Malaysia. He explained that
                            his public assurances of US support for the Philippines made during the
                            recent visit of President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> were prompted by information <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0214"/>we had received of Indonesian meddling
                            in Mindanao and involvement in Manila demonstrations. The Secretary said
                            we planned naval visits to Philippine ports as a further warning to the
                            Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded discussion of this subject by emphasizing the
                            importance of complete precision in understanding between the President
                            and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> so that
                            there is no risk of anything being taken for granted. The Foreign
                            Secretary expressed agreement and added that full information concerning
                            any intended or contemplated action should be exchanged between our two
                            countries even if no action is expected of the other party.</p>

                        <p>853. For <persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador. In Honolulu I met
                            with President and Board of Regents University of Honolulu, and have
                            been offered Chancellorship of East West Center. This looks like
                            challenging responsibility and I am inclined to accept but have deferred
                            decision pending consultation with you, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>US-Indonesian relations are at moment as sensitive and delicate as I have
                            known them to be. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s tremendous victory has been enthusiastically
                            welcomed by leadership here. I have been congratulated personally by all
                            leading Cabinet personalities on Johnson victory which is interpreted
                            here not as meaning any change in US position on Malaysia but as
                            significant in terms progressive approach of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to fundamental world problems, in particular social and
                            economic advancement of less developed countries. In my opinion, we have
                            in Indo reaction to results of election foundation upon which we can
                            build an effective relationship between our two countries and continue
                            to attempt to exercise intelligent restraint and counsel for moderation.
                            Opportunity to accomplish this, however, is likely to depend upon manner
                            in which transition between Ambassadors is handled.</p>
                        <p>This situation is well nigh unique. Here we have Indonesian President
                            who, while he is basically opposed to Western influence in his country,
                            has retained a close relationship with the representative of the most
                            powerful Western country with whatever possibility for moderating
                            counsel on our part this may have provided.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing plus other elements in this situation suggest desirability
                            of personal consultation in Washington. Specifically, the following
                            matters require thoughtful consideration:</p>
                        <p>1. Timing and manner of my resignation and announcement and of acceptance
                            of Chancellorship.</p>
                        <p>2. How and when to inform <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> who could interpret my resignation as
                            fundamental policy change toward Indonesia on part US Government unless
                            convincingly presented to contrary.</p>
                        <p>3. Question of timing of my successor's appointment and means to pave way
                            for him. I would, of course, wish to retain for him as much of whatever
                            influence I have on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and other members of his government as possible. <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0216"/>Looking forward to my new
                            responsibility, a visit to Washington would also provide opportunity to
                            talk with Assistant Secretary McPherson and others concerned with East
                            West Center which would appear useful at this point.</p>
                        <p>As to timing, I have impression from President <persName corresp="#p_HEK1">Hamilton</persName> of University of Hawaii that, although Regents
                            are anxious for me to reach early decision, there is reasonable
                            flexibility re date of assumption new responsibility, provided
                            announcement is handled expeditiously.</p>
                        <p>If Department perceives no objection, I would plan to come to Washington
                            for brief consultations within next ten days. Please advise.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In telegram 465 to Djakarta, November 13,

                                “found it difficult to think of doing business with anyone else.”
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> reported that he told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> it would be impossible
                                to report such a request because it would look like he was “making a

                            in mind:</p>
                        <p>1. We cannot expect much progress unless we can get <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            on board, and they will be unwilling pick up existing peacefeelers and
                            unreceptive new approach until Indonesia has agreed, at least secretly,
                            to terminate attacks on mainland and has in fact done so over a period
                            of time. Considering <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s determination continue military pressure voiced in
                            conversations with you and Shann, what are chances you could persuade
                            him modify this position?</p>
                        <p>2. What specifically would we suggest to principals as subjects for
                            “meaningful talks”?</p>
                        <p>3. Would Indonesians be prepared take up <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> gambit on disposition captured infiltrators as opening
                            for broader bilateral talks?</p>
                        <p>4. What interpretation in context bilateral U.S.-Indonesian relations is
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> likely to place on our
                            initiative bring problem back to conference table? How great is danger

                            evidence softening U.S. attitude and one more demonstration U.S.
                            preparedness reward intransigence and rescue Indonesia from consequences
                            of its own conduct. <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0218"/>Assuming we
                            can work out acceptable and sufficiently detailed proposal, Dept hopes
                            we can be in position start discussion this subject with <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>

                            perhaps to a degree the start of jockeying for power in anticipation of

                                be confined at this time to disruptive operations against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. To use non-Communist elements was
                                risky because their positions were not well known, they were under
                                close surveillance by the Indonesian security service, and they
                                might involve longer-range commitments than the United States was

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>: The fulcrum of political power in
                            Indonesia is sustained by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> through the adroit balancing of power
                            organizations and personal loyalties. The principal identifiable power
                            entities in point are the Indonesian Army and the Partai Kommunis
                            Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). The status of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has been examined most recently
                            by the Office of Current Intelligence (<gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss>) in its Special Report of 23 October 1964, entitled
                                “<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the
                                Communists,”<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2"> Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Indonesia, Vol. III, Memos, 9/64–2/65,
                                [2 of 2].</note> the high points of which are pertinent to
                            consideration of the future course and emphasis of covert action in
                            Indonesia:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Party Growth</hi>: During the years 1951–1964 the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has increased from 12,000 to a
                            claimed membership of three million. This growth has been encouraged and
                            assisted by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who has
                            benefited from its highly organized support of his regime and its
                            objectives. <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss> observes:</p>
                        <p>“… <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has largely
                            suppressed political opposition to himself. Because this opposition was
                            invariably anti-Communist as well as anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, its suppression and the
                            failure of non-Communist groups to come forward has had the effect of
                            leaving the field to the Communists.”</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Party Strength</hi>: The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has devised, organized, and guided a variety of
                            specialized front organizations, in such traditional sectors as
                            peasants, labor, youth, and women. Membership probably involves between
                            10 and 12 million people.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Party Accomplishments</hi>: The cabinet
                            reorganization of August 1964 resulted in the appointment of three
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> members and three <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> sympathizers to ministerial rank (out
                            of 79). The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>-dominated National
                            Front, functioning as an integrated element of the national government,
                            has gained ascendancy over the administration of the provinces.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> still needs <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to protect it while it
                            consolidates its gains, and it probably hopes he will survive a few more
                            years but no longer. Within that time, if present trends continue, PKI
                            infiltration of national and local government and Communist
                            organizations of the peasantry will have become so effective that at
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s death the party
                            can make a bid for power with good chances of success.”</p>
                        <p>The Indonesian Army currently is the only organized entity capable of
                            resisting the trend described above. While <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> lives, it will not move
                            effectively to counter the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, nor is
                            its leadership by itself sufficiently astute politically to guide such
                            an effort. This in an atmos- phere in which the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> actively influences and participates in government and
                            administration, the Army responds defensively and individually. It is no
                            more of a counter-force than <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wants it to be. The Army is, furthermore, the
                            object of a sustained <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> penetration
                            program. <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss> also observes:</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, seeking to maintain
                            his own preeminent position, to preserve national unity, and to advance
                            Indonesia internationally at the expense of the West, finds it totally
                            inexpedient to challenge the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. His
                            tactics, combined with Communist single-mindedness, seem likely
                            ultimately to bring Indonesia under Communist control.</p>
                        <p>In essence, therefore, unless extraneous factors intrude, a
                            Communist-oriented Indonesia can be expected within the not too distant
                            future. What is clearly required is a program designed to separate
                            legitimate national aspiration, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> chauvinism and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> ambitions so that forces inimical to the United States
                            can be distinctly identified and countered.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Assumptions:</p>
                        <p>a. That the current trend of events and configuration of forces in
                            Indonesia will result in increasing <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            prestige, influence, and size unless positive as well as negative action
                            measures are taken.</p>
                        <p>b. That this <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> increase in strength
                            will result in a series of tests of strength.</p>
                        <p>c. That the prime object of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            strength-testing will be the United States, its representative
                            institutions and policies. This will be all too conveniently appended to
                            the Indonesian Government's avowed program of eliminating Western
                            influence and power in Southeast Asia, a program of which it is now
                            clear the anti-Malaysian campaign is only one aspect.</p>
                        <p>d. That on the death or removal from power of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, a power struggle will
                            ensue, with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and Indonesian Army
                            as principal protagonists.</p>
                        <p>e. That in terms of succession potential within or without the Government
                            of Indonesia, no individual or group of individuals now <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0221"/>possesses the influence or capability
                            of acquiring without reference to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> or the Army.</p>
                        <p>f. That recent events have shown that elements with strong nationalistic
                            and religious convictions do exist in Indonesia. That these elements,
                            working in tandem with the Army, and supplying an ideological and
                            conceptual base for the Army and allied elements, could constitute a
                            sufficient aggregate strength to forestall <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> victory in the eventual struggle of power elements for
                            succession.</p>
                        <p>g. That under present and likely future circumstances, insurgency,
                            military dissidence, and other disruptive action against the regime are
                            not desirable, and that a unified, unfragmented Indonesia is a major
                            desideratum.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Objectives</hi>: To counter these trends, a covert
                            action program including the following objectives is stipulated:</p>
                        <p>a. Through indirect means, take action to create an image of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as an increasingly ambitious, dangerous
                            opponent of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            legitimate nationalism. The role of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and its associated organizations as instruments of
                            neo-imperialism, especially Chinese neo-imperialism, would be
                            consistently emphasized.</p>
                        <p>b. Encouragement and coordination of the efforts of, and to the extent
                            securely possible, covert assistance to, individuals and organizations
                            prepared to take obstructive action against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. Development of a broad-gauge ideological common denominator,
                            preferably within the framework of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s enunciated concepts, to which practically all
                            political groupings in Indonesia except the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> (and possibly outright dissidents) can adhere, so that
                            the cleavage between the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and the
                            residue of Indonesian society can be widened. At the same time, this
                            common denominator can operate to reduce the normal and traditional
                            difference between individual parties, between Right and Left, between
                            non-Communist Marxists and religious nationalists, etc. Recent <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> disclosures suggest that for the
                            Communists, Pantja Sila is only a temporarily satisfactory expedient as
                            an ideology. Possibly adherence to the concepts of Pantja Sila will
                            serve as the required broad-based common denominator.</p>
                        <p>d. Identification and cultivation and where possible, coordination of

                            Indonesia is unusually fluid. The pertinence and feasibility of the
                            means described can be expected to fluctuate regularly. The
                            implementation of these means will be emphasized and de-emphasized to
                            correspond to the political necessities of the moment. Close and
                            continuing contact will be maintained with the Ambassador concerning all
                            aspects of implementing this program.</p>

                        <p>1. In principle, I am thoroughly in favor!<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">Reference is to <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> As our
                            overt leverage on, and links to, Indonesia decrease, this is all the
                            more needed.</p>
                        <p>2. We are entering a period of major flux in Indo politics, which could
                            become a struggle for power especially if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dies. We can't begin too
                            soon to lay groundwork for playing a role in this if we can.</p>
                        <p>3. Paper focuses on main threat to US interests, which is not really
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> or Sukarnoism,
                            but the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Indo is too important to
                            lose to PKI, which is most likely prospect at present.</p>
                        <p>4. I'm not sure how much impact recommended program would have. The brief
                            gives no order of magnitude of effort. But it's worth a try if following
                            question satisfactorily answered.</p>
                        <p>5. Key question is whether we can do what's proposed really clandestinely
                            without burning our fingers. If Bung or <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> really caught us at this game, we'd probably lose more
                            than we'd gain.</p>
                        <p>6. In sum, I'd fully endorse if those who are closer to Indo scene than I
                            will undertake that this can be launched discreetly and with reasonably
                            low risk of a backlash.</p>

                            pleas for US help in rescuing moderates within Indonesia from what could
                            easily become untenable position.</p>
                        <p>While I agree with many points in reftel I believe Department may
                            underestimate strength of sentiment here in favor of face-saving way out
                            on Malaysia issue. Important segments Indo military have been
                            embarrassed by obvious failure of efforts against mainland Malaya.
                            Burgeoning non-Communist movement fears dispute will be used to suppress
                            them. As result there seems to be unity of interest among significant
                            elements here which could give us leverage to help defuse dispute.</p>
                        <p>Regarding specific questions in para 2 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, we believe internal issues, especially local
                            concern over growing <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence, were
                            key elements in providing motivation for moderate forces. Failure of
                            “confrontation” was also a factor but this was probably secondary. In
                            early stages of non-Communist movement, settlement of Malaysian issue
                            with behind scenes help <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might have
                            lulled newly awakened moderates into false sense of believing everything
                            would soon be all right. However, movement has gained such momentum that
                            I do not believe this is any longer the case. Danger now is one of
                            suppression, since <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and FAR leftists
                            must be concerned by non-Communist drive and stirring up any issue or
                            tactics to restore status quo, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and others believe they are too strong to be
                            stopped except in wave of ultra-nationalistic frenzy which would almost
                            certainly accompany intensification of Malaysian dispute. This is
                            precise issue which helped them gain momentum and could now be turned
                            against them.</p>
                        <p>We share Dept's view that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> would be most reluctant to deprive himself of
                            weapon which might be used against moderates. However, we believe we

                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>Our comments on numbered paras reftel follow:</p>
                        <p>(1) We have gained impression here that while Brits going slow on talks
                            with Indos they have definitely not closed door. Results of Gilchrist's
                            latest talk with <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            may well encourage additional British moves. Australians, while somewhat
                            pessimistic regarding prospects, give impression here they willing
                            explore any possibility for peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>(2) First objective Indo-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> talks should
                            be merely to restore communications and establish some sort mutual
                            confidence. Only if discussions are started can Brits effectively stress
                            importance of ending Indo military attacks and persuade <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> that <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> not averse to direct discussions. We believe that
                            such talks, while useful prerequisite, probably would not succeed in
                            settling issue in which so much “face” involved. Talks could however
                            provide opportunity for seriously exploring viewpoints of parties
                            concerned and hopefully moving toward <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> or other impartial device which would actually
                            recommend solution. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            commitment in advance to adhere to <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>
                            decision was opposed by <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> but seems indicate Sukarno willing accept
                            impartial judgment which gives him opportunity end unsuccessful military
                            confrontation without appearing to bow to <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> or Western powers.</p>
                        <p>Only specific issue impeding direct <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> discussions PR
                            movement to AACC seems to be Indo guerrillas. Appears to us that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s insistence on
                            withdrawal these guerrillas as prerequisite for talks is not very
                            realistic. It doubtful if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> still has
                            control over those on Malaysian territory, and prime objective at
                            present should be to prevent further incursions and reduce chances of
                            escalation. If this issue could be bypassed we could move on to solution
                            which would be in interests of all concerned.</p>
                        <p>(3) Appreciate Amb <persName>Bell</persName>'s view that discussion of
                            captured infiltrators could provide means place <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> into direct
                            communication (<gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss>'s 622),<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">Dated November 23. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> INDON–MALAYSIA)</note> but I am inclined believe it
                            preferable if subject can be sidetracked for present. On basis past
                            experience by tripartite Foreign Ministerial negotiations in Bangkok
                            earlier this year, and estimate present Indo mood, I believe actual
                            result of bringing two sides together on issue of prisoner status would
                            be that talks never get beyond technical <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0225"/>stage, thus actually hamstringing chance for political
                            discussion of broader issues. It will be realized that approach of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to negotiations has consistently been completely
                            different and will likely continue to be. Indos have refused to come to
                            agreement on such aspects as guerrilla withdrawals, supervision of
                            cease-fire, etc., and instead have stated repeatedly that these things
                            can be readily solved if basic political settlement achieved. On
                            Malaysian side, such issues have been consistently viewed as stepping
                            stones to more basic agreement and, in manner almost “more British than
                            the British,” <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> has concentrated on
                            legal, technical and moral arguments to secure strict compliance to some
                            such preliminary agreement before proceeding further.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            will be willing to immerse negotiations again in what GOI considers as
                            side issues, and from our viewpoint such debates could easily offer
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> wholesome
                            room for maneuver and influence on President regarding alleged <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> obstructionism. I believe Indo
                            willingness to settle current confrontation can only be tested by
                            procedure which will largely avoid subordinate issues and go to heart of
                            intentions both sides with regard to basic rapprochement. Latter could
                            then create climate of feeling in which two important steps can be
                            taken: (1) Halt of Indo military attacks, and (2) formation of some such
                            mechanism as <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> which can give
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> political excuse
                            to call off policy which has become ingrained in political fabric of
                            Indo. This all presumes, of course, that prisoner issue will not
                            suddenly come to head and that <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> able
                            and willing to let issue vegetate quietly in legal channels for some
                            time. This has been our impression here on basis Embassy <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> and CAS reports.</p>
                        <p>(4) If US initiative used in carefully controlled fashion here and in
                                <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss>, I do not believe this would be
                            viewed as indication that “US prepared reward intransigence.” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> feels <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has abandoned neutral stand and is
                            actively supporting <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>. US initiative
                            now would in his eyes help restore balance and increase our credibility.
                            If Dept agrees to proposal that we take advantage this opportunity I
                            would plan make absolutely clear to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that we will not do for them in Malaysia
                            confrontation what we did in West Irian dispute. Situations are totally
                            different and US policies in no way similar. Instead of smoothing way
                            for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> achievement of main objective as
                            in settlement of dispute with Dutch over West Irian, our initiative this
                            time will essentially be for purpose of allowing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> graceful way to step back
                            without achieving stated objective of “crushing Malaysia.”</p>
                        <p>I would also propose outline to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dangers of Malaysian confrontation as we see it
                            and our concern over state US-Indo relations which stems in large part
                            from confrontation. I would hope be authorized to tell him new

                            possible <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0226"/>ways of ending present
                            dilemma, making point, as I have so often in past, that we recognize
                            Malaysia, disagree with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> current
                            activities against Malaysia, but that we wish to be helpful in achieving
                            peaceful solution to thorny question between two neighbors. We are not
                            concerned with substance of solution but in bringing parties concerned
                            together so that mutually satisfactory solution can be found. We hope
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will seriously pursue
                            discussions with British and make every effort move on to <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> or other device. Would be most useful
                            also to be able tell him we have good evidence <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> shares this view.</p>
                        <p>I believe we might begin by strongly encouraging British to follow up
                            promptly on encouraging beginning made by Gilchrist-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> conversation November

                                Djakarta, November 25, the Department suggested there was no
                                prospect that the United Kingdom and Malaysia would resume talks
                                with Indonesia while Indonesia continued to introduce new troops
                                into the conflict. The Department stated that it was not a problem

                        <p rend="center">RALLYING OF ANTI-COMMUNIST FORCES IN INDONESIA</p>
                        <p>1. For the first time in several years there are the faint stirrings of
                            an anti-Communist movement in Indonesia. Provoked by increasing boldness
                            on the part of the Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) and by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s own increasing reliance on the party, several
                            non-Communist figures have raised a new banner called “Sukarnoism.” The
                            movement is ostensibly dedicated to the defense of the President's
                            almost mystical Five Principles (Pantjasila), but its main purpose
                            appears to be that of combating <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            influence in the government and throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>2. It is too early to measure the movement's strength or effectiveness.
                            While it reportedly has received indirect approval from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and appears to have
                            enlisted important support, it could well collapse overnight if its
                            strategy of winning the President's support should fail and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> should move to suppress its
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>3. The movement first came to light during <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s absence on a foreign tour
                            from 17 September to 5 November, when articles berating the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> appeared in the Djakarta press. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> responded, of course, and a
                            lively polemic followed for several weeks. However, during the week
                            immediately preceding and the one immediately following <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s return, the polemic
                            subsided, almost as if the Sukarnoists feared retribution from the
                            President. The only government move against the group, however, was the
                            banning of a single Sukarnoist newspaper soon after the President's
                            return. In the absence of further repressive action, the group seems to
                            have taken on new courage, and its leaders are trying to organize and
                            expand the forces involved.</p>
                        <p>4. Minister of Trade <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>
                            leads the group, but Chaerul Saleh, third deputy prime minister and
                            concurrently minister of development, is also deeply involved. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, who is a former Indonesian
                            ambassador to the Soviet Union, and <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName> are ideologically attuned to the “right wing” of
                            the Murba (Proletarian) Party, usually described as the national
                            Communist Party of Indonesia. With Indonesia having moved a considerable
                            distance to the left under <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and
                                <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0228"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName> represent a “moderate”
                            position, and their activities are arousing the hopeful interest of
                            individuals who stand further to the right. The new group has advocated
                            the spreading of Sukarnoism, i.e., the President's teachings, as a means
                            of unifying the nation. Its spokesmen state that the campaign to crush
                            Malaysia and to spread Sukarnoism are inseparable. Early in the press
                            polemic, they attacked Communist Party Chairman <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> for a statement he allegedly made
                            disavowing the need for Pantjasila, to which all recognized political
                            parties are obliged to subscribe—“once the revolution is won.” Although
                            this particular line of attack has been abandoned, the Sukarnoists
                            continue to warn against those who are not true “Pantjasilaists.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> told US Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> on 19 November that his
                            movement has the support of the Nahdlatul Ulama (<gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss>), the only large Moslem party which is still legal; the
                            right wing of the National Party; and lower levels of the bureaucracy
                            and political parties. Sukarnoist press elements have organized a “Body
                            to Support Sukarnoism”; youth groups have organized a “Sukarnoist
                            Student Movement”; and several non-Communist labor federations
                            reportedly have banded together in an “undercover body” to support
                            Sukarnoism. The labor groups feel they must keep their organization
                            secret to avoid attack by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> feels that for the time
                            being the movement must remain a loose coalition.</p>
                        <p>6. Whether the Sukarnoists have the extensive support they claim cannot
                            be verified. For the most part only the statements of Djakarta
                            politicians are available. There is a large but disparate body of
                            non-Communist opinion in Indonesia, however, which would rally if given
                            a safe opportunity. By early November in North Sumatra, at least,
                            newspapers were cautiously echoing the new line from Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> apparently is
                            willing to see how the situation develops. According to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, a <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> official on 18 November requested and received <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s consent to “endorse
                            non-Communist ideas” in a speaking tour of East and Central Java.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is said to have
                            questioned the <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> leader closely about
                            the new movement's support, and the official reportedly told him that
                            the <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> is fully backing the new
                            force.</p>
                        <p>8. Probably as a result of this meeting and reports about it, support for
                            Sukarnoism during the next few days began to mushroom. Two military
                            leaders—Minister for Defense General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral
                            Martadinata—spoke openly in its behalf. Army leaders, initially
                            sympathetic but circumspect toward the new movement, are now making
                            statements which, while not specifically supporting it, obviously align
                            them with the Sukarnoists. Minister of Information Achmadi, who earlier
                            had opposed it, reportedly told Sukarnoist supporters in North Sumatra
                            to ignore attacks and to spread the doctrine <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0229"/>but to preserve national unity. Even First Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, who has
                            tried to curry favor with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> for
                            the past year and a half, reportedly received a Sukarnoist delegation,
                            was “very friendly,” and gave “valuable advice.” Parliament, scheduled
                            to open on 3 December, has postponed its next session until the second
                            quarter of 1965. The change may have been arranged to avoid an early
                            showdown between the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and the
                            Sukarnoists.</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, with its allies in the left
                            wing of the National Party, for the time being is on the defensive. It
                            has labeled Sukarnoism a disguise for “Communist phobia”—a favorite term
                            of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s—and has stressed
                            that the anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> campaign developed
                            behind <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s back while
                            he was out of the country. It charges that Sukarnoism is an attempt to
                            displace <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s term for the cooperation
                            of nationalist, religious, and Communist elements.</p>
                        <p>10. Prospects of the Sukarnoists seem to depend largely on the President.
                            Although he is opposed to divisive political tendencies, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is at the same time ever
                            willing to find effective pro-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> elements that can be used in his political
                            balancing game. In view of his preoccupation with his own political
                            position and his possible concern that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is pushing too hard, the successful development of
                            Sukarnoism may be of interest to him. He could be willing to overlook
                            for a time the fact that there are elements within Sukarnoist ranks whom
                            he distrusts and whom he has considered expelling from the recognized
                            political scene.</p>
                        <p>11. A major factor in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s permissive attitude toward the new anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> group may be his hope that he can use
                            it in maneuvering to schedule new talks on the Malaysia issue, and he
                            may even believe he can use it to get economic assistance from the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>12. Sukarnoist spokesmen are urging the US Embassy to take steps to
                            encourage <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Indonesian or
                            Indonesian-Malaysian talks. They state that unless the Malaysia issue is
                            peacefully settled, the new non-Communist movement will be smothered in
                            the continuing anti-Malaysia clamor, and efforts to remedy Indonesia's
                            deteriorating economy will continue to be frustrated. Although
                            Sukarnoist leaders have identified themselves with the Malaysia
                            confrontation, they seem to be trying to change its emphasis from a
                            politico-military to a politico-economic one as a means of pressing
                            national economic development. Although the Sukarnoists are not
                            necessarily being directed by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to approach the Americans, their needs and
                            strategy for the moment coincide with his.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During the course of an hour's talk with Mr. Peck November 27 in his
                            office regarding the Indo-Malaysian confrontation, I drew generously on
                            points developed in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName>'s
                            memo to me of November 25 and his talking points of November 23<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Neither found.</note> for your conversations
                            with Australian Foreign Minister Hasluck. In essence, I suggested that
                            there was merit in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> entering into
                            discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> as soon as
                            appropriate looking to negotiations over the Malaysian issue. Set out
                            below are my conclusions as to the British position on this issue, based
                            on my talks with Peck.</p>
                        <p>1. There is no prospect that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will
                            be willing or politically able to agree to resume talks with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> as long as Indonesia continues to
                            introduce new troops into the conflict. (This confirms views expressed
                            in Deptel 502 to Djakarta).<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">See <ref target="#d88fn6">footnote 6, Document 88</ref>.</note> Several
                            factors bear on British thinking:</p>
                        <p>(a) There is at present no real evidence of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s willingness to call off
                            the confrontation.</p>
                        <p>(b) The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believes that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is just beginning to feel
                            the pinch of a more resolute <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US
                            posture. Let him really feel the squeeze, together with the costs and
                            risks involved, and maybe (but only maybe) he will then be genuinely
                            inclined to negotiate on acceptable terms.</p>
                        <p>(c) Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> does not feel it
                            prohibitively expensive to resist the Indonesian confrontation. Besides,
                            the situation in Kalimantan is unlikely to escalate and the Malaysian
                            mainland incursions are so ineffective as to contribute to the <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>'s rising self-confidence. The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is likely to suffer more from the
                            confrontation than the UK/GOM.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> feels that any talks on the
                            confrontation issue should be principally between the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should not play into the
                            hands of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> who is
                            trying to create the impression that Indonesia's opponent in this
                            confrontation is a non-Asian ex- colonial <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0231"/>state. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> recognizes <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            sensitivities over any hint of a <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> deal behind
                            Malaysia's back.</p>
                        <p>3. While the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is not disposed to take
                            any initiative at this stage with regard to talks or negotiations, it
                            will keep lines of communication open and give due attention to
                            overtures from the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> side. Peck
                            considers that the appropriate channel of communication is in Djakarta
                            and he questions the reliability of feelers elsewhere and the utility of
                            trying to conduct talks elsewhere (such as in Bangkok, as suggested in
                            London's 2553 to the Department).<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">Dated
                                November 25. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
                                Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1
                                INDON–UK)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Peck did not say so, but I gained the impression that if a month were
                            to go by without any new landings on the Malaysian mainland or without
                            any increase in the scale of Kalimantan incursions, there might be a
                            basis for starting down the road of talks and negotiations. I believe
                            that, to have any real chance of success, such a lifting of the
                            intensity of the confrontation would have to be decided and acted upon
                            quietly and unilaterally by the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Its
                            completed performance might set the stage. However, there is no
                            guarantee that even then the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> would be willing to move to
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>5. Peck seemed skeptical re the thesis (developed in Djakarta's 962 to
                            the Department)<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">
                                <ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>.</note> that negotiations are
                            now an urgent necessity in view of the danger that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> group would try to stir up the confrontation
                            in order to submerge the nascent “Sukarnoist” movement in a wave of
                            nationalistic frenzy. He did not argue against the possibility of this
                            happening but he was deeply suspicious of <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName> and perhaps others among the Sukarnoists.
                            Moreover, he saw no basis on which now to open negotiations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Both the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> could not and
                            would not concede on basic principles.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment</p>
                        <p>I see no point and considerable hazard in pushing the British on this
                            issue—at least at this time. It is up to the Indonesians to take some
                            tangible move to create the atmosphere and confidence necessary for
                            beginning talks looking to negotiations. To enter into such talks
                            prematurely is almost certain to lead to developments which tend to
                            inflame rather than tranquilize the situation. Even to appear at this
                            juncture to be too eager to start negotiations runs the clear risk of
                            being misread by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>This is not a question of our deferring to the British position in
                            Malaysia in return for their understanding and support of our positions
                            in Laos and Viet-Nam. It is a question of doing what is best in pursuing
                                <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0232"/>our own interests in
                            Indo-Malaysia. It so happens that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and US interests there and in Southeast Asia generally are the same.</p>
                        <p>Obviously there is great advantage in quiet coordinated US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies in the confrontation issue. The
                            time may arise over the next few months when we believe the British
                            should press forward with talks looking to negotiations, but when the
                            British will be reluctant to do so. If meanwhile we develop the closest
                            rapport with the British on this issue, showing understanding and
                            forbearance, then our chances of influencing the British position when
                            the time is ripe will be enhanced.</p>

                            among US public. In this connection, suggest you stress insult to US
                            flag, noting that US public no less aroused by such despicable acts than

                        <p>The Secretary began the meeting by asking about President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health. Deputy PriMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said that an
                            X-ray taken in Vienna some months ago had revealed there was a stone in
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s right
                            kidney. Inasmuch as his other kidney is already affected, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said, the X-ray had
                            given rise to real concern. Subsequent examination, however, had shown
                            that the second kidney stone was not serious. As a result, the concern
                            over President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            health had in general disappeared.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S.-Indonesian Relations</p>
                        <p>The Secretary broached the subject of U.S.-Indonesian relations by
                            commenting that “we have been having difficulties lately.” The Secretary
                            said he understood President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had expressed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> regrets over the damage caused by
                            demonstrations at <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> facilities in
                            Djakarta and Surabaya recently and had promised the Indonesian
                            Government would make adequate compensation for the damages. Although
                            appreciating President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s statement to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>, the Secretary continued, it must
                            be recognized that the general effect of such incidents is most
                            unfortunate, for they hamper efforts to improve U.S.-Indonesian
                            relations. The U.S. feels very strongly, the Secretary said, that steps
                            should be taken to prevent incidents of this nature in the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, in reply,
                            laughingly but apparently seriously expressed the hope that Indonesian
                            facilities in Washington would not receive “reciprocal treatment.”</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary asked what was uppermost in <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s mind concerning
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said it must be admitted that U.S.-Indonesian
                            relations are indeed at a very low level. Nevertheless, he said, he had
                            not lost hope they could be prevented from further deterioration; he
                            felt there was a possibility they could even be improved. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> then went on to note,
                            however, that there is among the Indonesian public great pressure for
                            terminating all U.S. information activities in Indonesia. Such a course,
                            he said, was not favored by President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied in a general way that relations between any two
                            countries tend to develop on a basis of reciprocity, that their
                            improvement or deterioration depends on the actions of both sides.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0235"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Malaysia</p>
                        <p>The Secretary broached the subject of Malaysia by commenting that the
                            U.S. does not fully understand what Indonesia wishes to achieve in the
                            dispute concerning Malaysia. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had already agreed to a
                            formula for a solution in Tokyo. One advantage of the Tokyo formula is
                            its “face saving” character—that is, it would permit a solution which
                            stemmed not from Western pressure but, rather, from recommendations made
                            by an Afro-Asian group. The Indonesian Government, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said, still stands by
                            its adherence to the formula worked out in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> said he believes
                            there is still a possibility for a solution of the Malaysian dispute,
                            although he admitted he saw no prospect of an immediate solution. He
                            commented that the political climate was more favorable now than it was
                            six months ago, suggesting that the new <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government might be “less inhibited” from finding a
                            solution than the previous <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government.
                            He said he still wishes to undertake talks with the new British Foreign
                            Minister, <persName corresp="#p_GWPC1">Patrick Gordon Walker</persName>,
                            and indicated the possibility of such talks was one reason for his
                            present trip.<note n="2" xml:id="d92fn2">In telegram Secto 34 to London,

                                available in Europe and would be interested in talking with

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was his impression that the atmosphere in London is
                            now “somewhat different.” He went on to emphasize, however, that both
                            the British and the Malaysians feel it is impossible for the political
                            process of negotiations to begin functioning as long as Indonesian raids
                            and incursions against Malaysian territory continue. The Secretary then
                            asked for <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s views
                            as to the chances for a period of quiet during which such raids and
                            incursions would cease. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> replied, somewhat evasively, that such a
                            period of quiet would be possible if there were indications that all
                            sides are willing to find a solution and if all sides proved willing to
                            tone down their provocations. In this respect, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> specifically referred
                            to broadcasts beamed to Indonesia by Radio Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of the economic situation in Indonesia (see Part
                            III), the Secretary said he could see no reason for not arriving at a
                            quick, peaceful solution of the dispute. The U.S., he said, wants such a
                            solution, for if confrontation were to grow into a serious armed clash,
                            the result could not but be costly and unfortunate for all concerned. At
                            this stage, the Secretary said, the most important thing is the future
                            of Indonesian raids and incursions. He went on to express the hope that
                            some informal way could be found to terminate such incidents. In this
                            way, it <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0236"/>might be possible to
                            bring into operation the political process of negotiations, such as the
                            four-nation Afro-Asian group agreed to in Tokyo. The Secretary went on
                            to say that the U.S. does not like to envisage the prospect of the chain
                            reaction which could develop from the fact that Malaysia has allies
                            which, in turn, are allied to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> what he envisaged as the next step toward a
                            solution of the dispute, and specifically, whether there is any other
                            nation, such as Thailand or Japan, which could be of real assistance in
                            finding a solution. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> replied that any steps toward a solution must
                            use the Tokyo agreement as a basis. He then suggested that it is now up
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to take some initiative. In his
                            view, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> stated,
                            there are no insurmountable obstacles to a solution. He went on to
                            emphasize that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been “very easy” in the past and would
                            continue to be so in the future provided the proper “psychological
                            atmosphere” can be created.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary asked whether the Indonesians had had any serious
                            contact with the Malaysian Government, or whether <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> planned to talk with
                            the British Permanent Representative, Lord Caradon, in New York,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> replied in
                            the negative. He said there had been private discussions with Singapore
                            businessmen concerning possible solutions of the Malaysian problem, but
                            that there had been no official contacts with the Malaysian

                            <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0237"/>initiative are set forth below.
                            Following telegram presents specific recommendations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Analysis:</p>
                        <p>Efforts to settle Malaysia dispute have been on dead center for months.
                            Result has been a continuing deterioration in US-Indonesian relations,
                            increasing danger of escalation of military conflict, strengthening of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> within Indonesia, and ever
                            tighter Indo bonds with Asian Communist regimes. Importance of
                            settlement increases with each passing day if effective support is to be
                            given to anti-Communist movement within Indonesia and if we are to
                            maneuver Sukarno into position in which he has no recourse but to accept
                            some kind of peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>Dept has made clear and I agree that sine qua non preceding talks is de
                            facto cessation of hostilities. I continue to believe that four-power
                                <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> Commission (<gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>) is most likely instrument—indeed
                            perhaps only one ready to hand—through which settlement can be effected.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, having pledged
                            himself to accept commission's recommendations, avoids necessity of
                            selling to his people (or to <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) any
                            particular formula and can accept through this mechanism solution that
                            he could not afford to support directly.</p>
                        <p>Objections to <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> have been brought up
                            by Brits on ground that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would always be able to exert sufficient
                            pressure upon his own nominee (Pakistan at moment seems likeliest
                            selection) so that no proposal to which he objected could be adopted. My
                            own view is that through diplomatic channels we could determine other
                            three members so that from <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            standpoint cards would be stacked in its favor. (If successful in
                            earlier steps I am proposing in following telegram, I would also hope we
                            might help <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> find acceptable
                            formula, e.g. [garble] plebiscite.) In any event, if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is bluffing, which I doubt
                            because I think it is in his own interest to achieve some kind of
                            drawback, I believe it is time we called his bluff. If we do not, he
                            will always be able to exploit his position with many as having gone
                            last mile in order to achieve peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>In our view, internal developments as described in recent reporting and
                            state of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health are
                            strong pressures on President to find way out of militant
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>I hear much from <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> sources to effect:
                            “We've got <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on the
                            run. This is no time to talk settlement.” This neglects consideration of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s character and
                            fierce national pride of other Indo leaders. He will never accept
                            humiliation and in present impasse there is real danger he will turn to
                            whatever alternatives are available, regardless how desperate they may
                            be. There no need to outline these self-evident alternatives. Any of
                            them would inevitably bring about further US <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0238"/>military involvement in SEAsia, further deterioration
                            of relations with Indonesia, and further likelihood of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> control by <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, with all of its larger implications for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position in this area.</p>

                        <p>For almost two months we have been holding back, hoping for fruitful
                            results from anticipated direct discussions between <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>,
                            but combination of British reluctance and tentative nature Indo
                            overtures has resulted in exactly nothing thus far. It seems to me that
                            further delay simply plays into hands of those elements in Indonesia who
                            do not want a solution to this dispute and increases danger escalation.
                            Problem then is how to get <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to call off his dogs.</p>
                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 646 we suggested a scenario
                            for dealing with composition of the 4-power commission which has
                            received general Dept approval in principle and endorsement of Embassies
                            Manila and Kuala Lumpur but no steps have as yet been taken to implement
                                it.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">In telegram 646 from Djakarta,

                            suggestion which may be worth a trial. I would suggest we put this into
                            effect immediately if any talks which may be held between <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> officials and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> during latter's current

                            somewhat as follows:</p>

                            endeavor to obtain agreement to make unpublicized halt in further

                                stated he did not think that the Malaysians would be willing to act
                                on the basis of a 3-week cessation of hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> recommended trying to obtain
                                an open-ended commitment from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for cessation. (National Archives and

                                1135 from Djakarta, December 17, <persName>Jones</persName> stated
                                that he did not intend to imply that hostilities would be permitted
                                to resume after 3 weeks, but he was sure that he could not convince
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to give an
                                open pledge. (Ibid.)</note> Simple plea on my part would be
                            redundant and probably useless. I propose that I seek his commitment in
                            return for promise of active display of American interest in promoting
                            settlement at end of three week period.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me scenario along following lines would have best chance of
                            success. I would tell Sukarno that I not acting under instructions but
                            that I believe <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be willing
                            assist in bringing contesting parties together if it clear <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> really wants to negotiate. I would
                            point out fact <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> appear to doubt that he wishes end
                            military action. Thus I believe it essential he demonstrate his serious
                            intentions by halting all military action for a period of three (3)
                            weeks. I would tell him that if this is done I believe my government
                            would agree to assist in efforts to move dispute to conference table. I
                            would then outline briefly steps described below. Ask President whether
                            he believes idea has merit, and seek determine whether he interested in
                            putting into effect three (3) week moratorium to see if plan can be
                            carried out.</p>
                        <p>I would point out that actual performance and not just promise was
                            essential as any default would inevitably become known to <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and
                            thus poison prospect for success. In addition, cessation of hostilities
                            would be expected to continue during period active discussions taking
                            place in capitals concerned.</p>
                        <p>Step 2: If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            forthcoming, inform <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s commitment and importance taking constructive
                            attitude to see if he is bluffing. Also express reassurances that any
                            USG initiative will be taken only when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s performance on promise is evident and that our
                            efforts designed solely to get parties together, not to take sides in
                            dispute. Throughout, I believe fact of cease-fire must be kept secret
                            (we should have no difficulty measuring actual performance), for if
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> publicly reveals such a
                            commitment in advance of more basic political understandings, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will almost certainly
                            repudiate whole thing and charge Tunku with insincerity.</p>

                            Lumpur to confer with Amb <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>
                            and discuss situation with such <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            authorities as <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> deems
                            appropriate. (I am of course well acquainted with many <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> personalities from earlier years and
                            would hope that announcement of my intention to resign will have removed
                            to considerable degree whatever stigma of partisanship <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> leaders might have attached to me.)
                            Frank discussion of internal Indo developments and attitudes might be
                            useful in convincing <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> leadership that
                            it in our common interest to engage Indos in negotiations as means
                            avoiding escalation, buying time, and inhibiting <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. I would be able to argue that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s adherence to moratorium
                            on hostilities justified positive Malaysian participation in attempt to
                            reopen political dialogue and search for appropriate mechanism or
                            formula which could remove some of dangers inherent in present military
                            phase of Indo confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Step 4: Amb <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> and I proceed
                            together to Djakarta for discussions with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> in effort nail down
                            whatever understanding may have been reached with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>, whether it involves initiation of
                            direct <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> contacts, implementation of <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> concept, or some other suggestion.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I wish to say that in suggesting Dept use <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> and me to connect wires between
                                <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> and Djakarta, I do so recognizing
                            that this is thankless task and that I would welcome any alternative
                            Dept or Amb <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> may have to
                            suggest. Main point is that I consider it vital to get something
                            underway soonest. Time, as I have said before, is not on our side.</p>

                            Dept may wish consider following additional points in determining nature
                            and extent any US initiative:</p>
                        <p>1. Regardless of its nature Indos may interpret our initiative as sign of
                            weakening determination and take it as proof that their strategy of
                            applying military pressure to force Malaysians to negotiate is working.
                            If this is their interpretation, atmosphere for negotiation unlikely be
                            favorable. Malaysians and/or British would be at disadvantage from
                            start.</p>
                        <p>2. Apparently underlying Amb <persName>Jones</persName> proposal is
                            assumption that Malaysia-Indonesia dispute is source of worsening
                            US-Indonesia relations. Corollary this assumption is that our
                            intervention to promote settlement of dispute would lead to improvement
                            our relations with Indonesia. I think we should consider alternative
                            analysis that dispute not root cause our difficulties but rather a
                            noteworthy reminder that US-Indonesian relations have been in long term
                            declining trend for some time. If this be so (and Dept assessment of few
                            months ago seems suggest Dept thinking in these terms), our support of
                            Malaysia may simply have called attention to this trend somewhat sooner
                            than might otherwise have been case.</p>
                        <p>3. In this regard it is possible that our difficulties with Indonesia
                            stem basically from deliberate, positive <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> strategy of seeking to push Britain and the US out of
                            Southeast Asia. If this is case, growing Indonesian alignment with
                            Communist countries should be seen as outgrowth such strategy rather
                            than as result of frustration over unsuccessful confrontation against
                            Malaysia. Current intelligence reports, especially those covering Chen
                            Yi's recent visit to Indonesia, suggest that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy of at least tacit collaboration with ChiComs in
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> policy may indeed be of Indos
                            own choosing. If this is situation, we should ask ourselves whether
                            proposed new initiative in Malaysia-Indonesia dispute truly offers hope
                            of thwarting rise of Communist influence over or in Indonesia, <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0242"/>or whether it will merely
                            encourage Indo belligerence while sapping morale of Malaysians and
                            perhaps of other <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries. (Believe
                            this view held by both <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australia.)
                            Way we handle new intervention should be shaped in light our whole range
                            of objectives in Southeast Asia. What we are up against now is problem
                            of reconciling our objectives towards Malaysia, Indonesia and <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> as a whole. While it is extremely
                            important to do what we can to rescue situation in Indonesia, it also
                            important to ensure viability Malaysia and continued ability British to
                            play their vital security role in this region.</p>

                        <p>One thing we must avoid is commitment to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> (or proposal he would twist into commitment)
                            which we cannot fulfill. We would also have to consult Malaysians and

                            negotiations. Malaysians and British almost certain reject out of hand
                            any formula that would require them start substantive talks with Indos
                            in return for moratorium on incursions limited to specific time period.
                            Open-ended moratorium would probably be salable without further
                            conditions (i.e., academic insistence on withdrawals) but we cannot
                            guarantee this or give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> grounds for claiming our guarantee. Following
                            approach has not been discussed with British or Australians and we would
                            not propose do so until <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> response known.</p>

                            from President:</p>
                        <p>a. President has noted with concern recent reports regarding <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health. He extends his
                            best wishes for speedy full recovery and hopes current difficulties will

                            President would be pleased provide services of appropriate US medical
                            specialist to travel Indo to assist in diagnosis. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. You should take no initiative in
                            offering US medical facilities. For various reasons, including
                            responsibility for life of such a sick national leader, we prefer that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> not come US for
                            treatment. If specialist visits Indonesia, he will be similarly
                            instructed. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> raises
                            matter, however, you should respond that you would be happy inform
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of his interest and are
                            confident <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would do whatever it could
                            to be of help. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                            President would be happy welcome him to Washington for informal talks,
                            subject to unforeseen circumstances which might affect schedule of

                            instruction if you believe this useful) that we continue to be more than
                            willing to assist <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in
                            finding honorable solution to the problem which exists between him and
                            Malaysia. In our opinion, what is preventing negotiated solution at this
                            point is fact that continuation hostile actions by Indonesia against
                            Malaysia has led <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> to
                            believe that, despite public protestations to contrary, Indonesia does
                            not really want to settle the problem. We feel that if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would quietly cut off
                            hostile action a new atmosphere would be created in which hopefully we
                            would be able to work effectively to encourage negotiations. We cannot
                            estimate how long this would take, but would watch situation closely and
                            plan to keep in touch with Sukarno on it. You should emphasize, however,
                            that we are simply unable to encourage anyone negotiate in this

                            Presidential response. I assume you may want to discuss this at the
                            Ranch tomorrow. Here are two possible courses of action.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0245"/>
                        <p>A. If, as you suggested, the President is having second thoughts at
                            letting Howard go, my own preference would be for us to be moderately
                            forthcoming in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>1) The President should inform <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, by letter, that he has checked with Jones and
                            the East-West Center and has arranged a six-month delay in
                                <persName>Jones</persName>' retirement.</p>
                        <p>2) He should express his deep concern over the state of U.S.-Indonesia
                            relations and his hope that we can use <persName>Howard</persName>'s
                            final six months as a period in which to reverse the present
                            deteriorating trend. Despite our desire for better relations, however,
                            things simply cannot improve so long as the Indos pursue confrontation
                            through raids against Malaysia. We cannot be helpful while aggression
                            continues in any form; in the absence of aggression, we stand ready to
                            be of assistance, etc.</p>
                        <p>(Rationale: There is no point in ridding ourselves of an asset like
                                <persName>Jones</persName> at a critical time in Indonesia's
                            internal development when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may well disappear from the scene.
                                <persName>Howard</persName> knows all the rival leaders; he is also
                            one of the few non-Marxists who still has regular access to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. There is also no point in
                            turning down <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            personal request at a time when we haven't yet found the ideal
                            replacement.)</p>
                        <p>B. If, in the President's judgment, <persName>Howard</persName> should
                            still move out on schedule, I would urge that a speedy decision be
                            reached on his successor—and communicated through a conciliatory
                            personal letter from the President in response to the present plea. I do
                            not believe that Beam is the right man for the stormy period ahead.
                            Ideally we need a man of warmth, vitality, and shrewd political sense,
                            fast on his feet, with a personal tie to the President.</p>
                        <p>The following names are the unrefined product of my Christmas
                            ruminations:</p>
                        <p>a) If we choose someone from inside the Service:</p>
                        <p>Henry A. Byroade (now Ambassador to Burma). Byroade's assets are a West
                            Point background, extensive service in the Far East, a stint as NEA
                            assistant secretary, good political instincts, an engaging personality.
                            He struck it off extremely well with Nasser in 1955–6 (too well for
                            Foster Dulles, as you will recall). He has been sitting on his hands in
                            Rangoon. He lacks the Presidential tie.</p>
                        <p>b) If we choose an outsider:</p>
                        <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.</p>
                        <p>Abram Chayes</p>
                        <p>Pierre Salinger</p>
                        <p>Eugene V. Rostow</p>
                        <p>(In two of these cases, Indonesia's Islamic cast should be borne in mind;
                            not an insuperable obstacle.)</p>

                        <p>Over past four months Indonesia has committed considerable numbers
                            regular military forces to the anti-Malaysia campaign. Large scale
                            reinforcement currently underway in Indonesian Borneo, and, since
                            mid-December, raids against mainland Malaysia have in- creased.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Assault on Mainland Malaysia</hi>. The Indonesian
                            military has apparently formulated a plan for an amphibious assault on
                            mainland Malaysia. The plan has reportedly been designed as a response
                            should there be a British/Malaysian attack on Indonesian bases used in
                            the infiltration effort. Reinforcements have been sent to Central
                            Sumatra which may be destined for use in such operation, but no
                            indications it actively preparing for such assault.</p>

                            Malaysia severely limited by lack sufficient continuing air cover,
                            overall shortage transport, and extremely difficult logistic and supply
                            problems. Difficulties encountered during early December joint serv-
                            ices maneuvers, which included amphibious landing, probably made
                            military and naval leaders aware Indonesian deficiencies in such
                            operation.</p>

                            infiltrating teams, varying from six to forty men, at various points
                            along the western coast concentrating on Johore State. Several hundred
                            persons, including Indonesian civilian volunteers, defectors from

                            military and police units, located at these bases and available for
                            infiltration. Since December 15, over a hundred persons have been
                            infiltrated. All have been apprehended or killed by Malaysian security
                            forces within days after they landed. We estimate raids of same
                            magnitude will probably continue through January.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Indonesian Buildup in Kalimantan</hi>. At end
                            December Indonesia reportedly intended increase its forces in Western
                            Indonesian Kalimantan by three brigades. Component units from first
                            brigade have already arrived. After reinforcements completed, probably
                            mid-February, Indonesian forces estimated to number at least 12,500—an
                            increase of at least 10,000 since November. Reinforcements apparently
                            also planned in Eastern Indonesian Borneo although probably not on same
                            magnitude as buildup western Kalimantan.</p>
                        <p>6. These forces will probably be used to infiltrate large teams in
                            attempt gain control small pockets in Malaysian Borneo, possibly as
                            basis for de facto recognition of a rebel government. Size of buildup
                            suggests considerably larger infiltration attempt than a year ago when
                            infiltration of up to 800 troops and volunteers created serious security
                            problem in Sabah and Sarawak. While possibility of conventional attack
                            against limited target cannot be entirely dismissed, problem of
                            sustained air cover, supply difficulties, and certainly British
                            retaliation would probably convince Indonesian military leaders not to
                            follow such course. However, they may believe that infiltration of large
                            units, possibly up to company size, would not prompt British
                            counterstrike against Indonesian territory, and yet would be large
                            enough to ensure capture and retention of territory.</p>
                        <p>7. Borneo operations probably still in planning stage, and probably will
                            not occur until all reinforcements have been completed, possibly
                            mid-February or early March.</p>

                            army, navy and air force personnel are assigned to the British Far
                            Eastern Command; overwhelming bulk committed to Malaysian theater of
                            operations. This includes a reinforcement—now underway—of approximately
                            1,300 troops announced as part of a countermove against the Indonesian
                            buildup in Indonesian Kalimantan. Malaysian armed forces number
                            approximately 35,000 which, with units from Australia and New Zealand,
                            brings Commonwealth strength to over 95,000.</p>
                        <p>Parallel with the buildup of troop strength, the Malaysian Government has
                            imposed series security regulations which are designed to detect
                            Indonesian infiltrations. In addition to regular air, naval and <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0248"/>land patrols these include
                            curfews in coastal areas, prohibition on the movement of all boats at

                            groups to guard coast and strategic points and report movements of
                            strangers.</p>

                            Malaysia. A number infiltration attempts have been stopped on beaches,
                            and in some cases infiltrators have been picked up while still in
                            boats.</p>

                                that it would be better if Herbert should go to Manila, Kuala

                                useful “time-gaining exercise.” (Johnson Library, National Security

                        <p>State's preliminary view is that the situation is not quite as bad as
                                <persName>Jones</persName> suggests; that it would be very risky to
                            expend all our capital in a Presidential meeting with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> outside the country (which
                            would be used by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to
                            push his self-image as the paramount leader of the Afro-Asian world);
                            and that in any event such a meeting would treat only a symptom of the
                            disease and not the disease itself.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, we are persuaded that a two-stage initiative might make good
                            sense at this juncture: a brief trip by the Vice President to Manila,
                            Kuala Lumpur and Djakarta sometime before mid-February (with Djakarta
                            the focal point); and, if this first step brings any results, a meeting
                            between the President and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Hawaii sometime in April or May.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the situation does call for an early exercise in personal
                            diplomacy, short of the Presidential level. If approved, a <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> visit should take place well
                            before the Algiers conference, now scheduled for sometime in March—a
                            conference at which Indonesia will certainly behave very badly. Judging
                            by past experience, the Indos shape up rather well in anticipation of
                            visits from our top brass. This <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0250"/>might give us a respite during the period immediately before <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>'s arrival; and if <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> gets anywhere with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, the visit might
                            conceivably have some effect on the Indo performance in Algiers.</p>
                        <p>If the <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> visit goes
                            smoothly, the Hawaii meeting might possibly be focused on some such
                            gimmick as <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Howard Jones</persName>'
                            installation as Chancellor of the East-West Center. The Center has been
                            a long-time interest of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>; and it would be feasible to hold a special
                            convocation for <persName>Jones</persName>' installation to which
                                <persName>Jones</persName>' pal <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could logically be invited.</p>
                        <p>As a possible alternative to the <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> trip, we might also consider a first step of
                            lower visibility and have Mike Forrestal test the climate in
                            Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>As an alternative to the Hawaii meeting, we might consider a Presidential
                            invitation to both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> to come to
                            Washington for talks—along the lines of his invitation to Papandreou and
                            Inonu last year.</p>
                        <p>All this is very tentative and subject to a good deal more discussion at
                            State. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName> is talking with
                            your brother this weekend, and we hope to have a formal recommendation

                        <p>I think it would be sheer folly to have any presidential meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> except under
                            terms we have previously approved. I don't want to belabor a point on
                            which I gather you are agreed but here are a few considerations:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is bent on a course
                            of action from which he will not be dissuaded. Momentarily he might
                            smile and do a few pleasant <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0251"/>things but he would maintain his current course. This would be less
                            than helpful to our President both at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>2. A presidential meeting would be an open invitation for others to
                            emulate <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. It would
                            show that the bad boys are the ones that get the attention. It would
                            have decisively serious impact on countries like Korea, Vietnam and
                            perhaps even Thailand and the Philippines as far as the Far East is
                            concerned. God knows how the Africans would react.</p>
                        <p>3. We are anxious to have the British and Australians play a firm
                            military role in Southeast Asia. We are also anxious to have their
                            support for our actions in Vietnam, Laos and elsewhere. Merely to
                            suggest a presidential visit to the British might be most harmful.</p>
                        <p>4. To favor Sukarno with a presidential invitation at this time would
                            convince <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> all the more
                            that he can play his pro-Communist iconoclastic role in world affairs
                            without fear of reaction from the Americans nor indeed from the British
                            since he would figure that the Americans would now exercise a
                            restraining influence upon the British and Australians.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName>Jones</persName>' easy ambiance with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is helpful but it has not
                            and will not influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s course of action. Nor will our aid or lack of
                            aid influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. What
                            sets limits on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            course of action are:</p>
                        <p>(a) Internal factors which are beyond our capability to influence;</p>
                        <p>(b) Afro-Asian criticism of his confrontation policies, of his quitting
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, etc.</p>
                        <p>(c) Soviet reactions (e.g., Moscow can scarcely anticipate with pleasure
                            another <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> meeting on
                            confrontation).</p>
                        <p>A presidential visit at this juncture while the above factors may be
                            having a useful yeasty effect could upset the whole process.</p>
                        <p>6. Our President and Secretary continually use the line that we cannot
                            have dealings with Communist China or admit it to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> while Peiping pursues its present
                            aggressive course in Southeast Asia. How can we reconcile this posture
                            with a presidential meeting with a man who admits aggression against his
                            Southeast Asian neighbors?</p>

                        <p>The President opened the conference with Congressional leaders by
                            explaining why it had been called. He said that at the very beginning of
                            the Congressional session he wanted to develop procedures which would
                            make it possible for the Administration to think and plan with
                            Congressional leaders. He was ready to be frank and candid in all
                            matters but to do so the discussions must not get into the public
                            domain. Real damage is done to the national interest when information
                            such as that which will be given during the course of the morning
                            meeting gets into the newspapers. The objective is to make possible an
                            examination of our foreign policy and our defense structure by the
                            Congressional leaders of both parties who are stewards of these
                            policies. We do not separate Democrats and Republicans in Vietnam. He
                            wanted to work with the legislative leaders in understanding, if not
                            agreement, on both sides of the House and Senate. During the Eisenhower
                            Administration the system of consulting Congressional leaders was <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0253"/>the best he had ever known. The
                            meetings were not many, perhaps 4 or 5, but President Eisenhower, who
                            had been blunt and frank with Congressional leaders, had asked for their
                            judgments on important problems.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee and the
                            Foreign Relations Committee had not been invited to this morning's
                            meeting because he wished to limit this conference to very few persons.
                            At a later date it will be possible to enlarge the number. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> had already briefed the
                            Congressional committees on foreign policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would be going to the Hill
                            later to spell out our defense posture, part of which had already been
                            made public in the Defense message sent to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was available for personal meetings with individual
                            legislative leaders at any time.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to Indonesia-Malaysia.]</p>
                        <p>In addition to our problems with Nasser, the President continued, we are
                            having trouble with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.
                            Our Ambassador in Indonesia, who is one of our ablest, believes the only
                            way to get <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to turn
                            away from his current policies, which are disastrous for the political
                            and economic future of Indonesia, is to invite him to come here to meet
                            with me. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> says we
                            must appeal to the vanity of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in a final effort to halt him before it is too
                            late. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>, in his
                            cables, gives us a different picture of what is going on in Indonesia
                            than appears in the newspapers.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to Indonesia-Malaysia.]</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then discussed the
                            situation in Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is deep in domestic difficulties. His
                            “confrontation” with Malaysia is possibly an attempt to divert attention
                            from the serious local problems which he has not been able to solve. The
                            United States is not going to take over the Malaysia problem because it
                            is primarily a British problem. The British, already deeply committed,
                            have sent substantial military force into the area. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will probably not push his
                            “confrontation” policy to the point of undertaking major military
                            actions. One new element is that knowledge of Sukarno's illnesses has
                            become widely known and the succession problem is being discussed
                            publicly in Indonesia. Although the United States has investments
                            amounting to one-half billion dollars in Indonesia, any attempt to
                            blackmail us by threatening to confiscate these investments is not a
                            possibility. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> now
                            obtains $125 million dollars annually in foreign exchange from these
                            investments which he would be unable to do without. These foreign
                            exchange resources would be lost if he moved in to take over the oil
                            companies. The only U.S. aid we are now giving to Indonesia consists of
                            funds to pay for military training. We feel such training is in our
                            interest because it helps to tie us closer to Indonesian military <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0254"/>leaders, who may well play a
                            major role in the decision as to the future political orientation of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to say that all U.S. military assistance going
                            to Indonesia is being provided because it is in our national interest,
                            not theirs. He hoped that those present would make this point clear.</p>
                        <p>Senator Dirksen asked why the Australians are so upset about developments
                            in West New Guinea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            replied that the situation in West New Guinea is quiet. The Australians
                            are concerned because if the Malaysian problem becomes more serious,
                            there may be difficulties for them in West New Guinea.</p>

                        <p>4596. For the Ambassador. Please deliver following message from the
                            President to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I am writing to share some thoughts about the worsening situation in
                            Indonesia, and to invite your comment on possibilities that have
                            occurred to me here. As you will judge from the contents of this letter,
                            the thoughts expressed have been very closely held within my government,
                            and I am sure the same will be true in yours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s withdrawal from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not seem to us too serious in
                            itself, and indeed may get him into serious difficulties during the year
                            as he attempts to exert influence through the proposed Afro-Asian
                            Conference. It is already clear that it has, if anything, worsened his
                            standing in this circle.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, the recent events in Indonesia, both military and political,
                            clearly point to the possibility of increased military action against
                            Malaysia and of a further swing to the left in the internal <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0255"/>political balance. Even though these
                            latter tendencies may have been checked for the moment, the power of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> seems to be growing steadily,
                            whether because <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            actually encourages this or because he no longer has full control. Even
                            if his health should hold up, the prospect seems to be that the left
                            will gain steadily. If he should die or become incapacitated, the left
                            is now in a strong position to move to take over. In short, Indonesia
                            seems to be moving rapidly toward more aggressive policies externally
                            and toward communist domination at home.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have never been hopeful that negotiations or discussions
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would produce
                            lasting solutions and get him back to work solving his serious economic
                            problems and bringing the left under control. Nonetheless, I feel
                            strongly that we cannot let Indonesia continue along its present path
                            without exhausting every possible measure to turn it from catastrophe.
                            Even if we are unsuccessful, we would have made every last effort we
                            could make to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Two possibilities have now occurred to me that might just help. One would
                            be to take advantage of Sukarno's now-repeated statement that he would
                            accept the findings of any four-power Afro-Asian Conciliation
                            Commission. This has been stated in terms of findings of such a
                            Commission with respect to the sentiments of the inhabitants of Sarawak
                            and Sabah. It carried also the implication that he would accept a call
                            by such a Commission for the cessation of Indonesian aggressive
                            activities—infiltration in Borneo and the sporadic raids now being
                            conducted against Malaya itself. I do not think we can now expect the
                            Philippines to play a useful role in resuming the negotiating track that
                            broke off in Tokyo last June. The Thai seem equally disillusioned.
                            However, the Japanese have retained some modest influence in Djakarta
                            and might be prepared to undertake a quiet initiative in this direction.
                            During my recent talks with Sato,<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Eisaku
                                Sato, Prime Minister of Japan.</note> it was clear that they were
                            quite willing to do whatever might be helpful, although I most
                            specifically did not urge that they take on this particular job at the
                            moment. I wonder now whether this may not be worth a try.</p>
                        <p>I see all the difficulties, and of course the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> is quite right in insisting that actions are
                            needed rather than words on the Indonesian side. But it seems to me that
                            there is just enough hope in the recent indications to warrant another
                            try.</p>
                        <p>My second idea is a much more far-reaching one, and I am sure you will
                            not misunderstand my purpose in putting it forward for your reaction.
                            Plainly, it would require the closest consultation with you and careful
                            preparations with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0256"/>
                        <p>Briefly, it has long been my judgment that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> set great store by his
                            personal relationship with President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>. The rapport which appears to have existed
                            between the two men did not change the basic direction of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policy, but was certainly
                            of value as a point of contact with the Indonesian President and may
                            have had some moderating effect on his actions. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s personal vanity is
                            maddening; but it may be a possible handle that might be turned to use.
                            I have never met <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            there is the possibility that we could use an official visit to the
                            United States as a tactic to appeal to this vanity and at the same time
                            provide an opportunity to divert him from his current path. The
                            invitation in itself would confront him with a dilemma. His vanity and
                            an acute sense of Indonesia's importance in the world would argue for
                            acceptance of the invitation. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            would probably oppose the visit with every resource at its disposal. We
                            might, therefore, drive a small wedge between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, and his acceptance of the invitation
                            would be from the outset some indication of his receptivity to the
                            counsels of moderation. I have already told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, through Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>, that I would be
                            prepared to receive him—as I would any other foreign Chief of State in a
                            like situation—if he should come to New York in connection with a
                            reopening ceremony at the Indonesian pavilion at the New York World's
                            Fair. Such an occasion would not arise before late April or May in any
                            event, however, and I do not believe it could well serve as the occasion
                            for really tough and serious discussions.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I have given thought to the possibility that I might invite
                            him to visit the United States and to see me in the fairly near future,
                            on the basis of what we would call an official visit, with some ceremony
                            but with the greatest possible stress on direct discussions.</p>
                        <p>Again, I am well aware of the difficulties surrounding such a proposal.
                            We would have to take every possible measure to be sure that it was not
                            understood as an attempt by the US to obtain a compromise of the
                            Malaysian dispute at the expense of the legitimate interests of
                            Malaysia. Rather, we would make clear that our objective was quite
                            simple—to have the opportunity for personal discussion and to stress our
                            well-known view that it is in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s and Indonesia's own interest to call off
                            confrontation of Malaysia and to turn the attention of Indonesia to the
                            solution of its tremendous economic and political problem. You can well
                            see that it would be essential from my own standpoint to make this
                            position entirely clear to Congress and to our own public opinion, which
                            would undoubtedly have great initial difficulty in understanding the
                            purpose of the invitation.</p>
                        <p>There are many other arguments which I need not review with you in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>I re-emphasize my awareness of all the considerations arguing against
                            this proposal, and recognize that it may prove as fruitless as <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0257"/>other past efforts have been to
                            change the course of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is today Indonesia, and I
                            believe we should explore every possible avenue to reach him and
                            influence him as a man.</p>
                        <p>I should be most grateful for your comments and counsel.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>We are now faced not only with known and growing danger from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, but with the uncertainties
                            of a possible Indonesia without <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. If this ailing dictator should indeed die in
                            the near future, his bequest to Indonesia would be international
                            outlawry, economic near-chaos, and weakened resistance to Communist
                            domination. Yet if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            lives on for some time to come, the chances of the Communist Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) to assume power will probably
                            continue to improve. We do not believe that a Communist Indonesia is
                            imminent, or that Sukarno will initiate war. In our view, however, there
                            is sufficient chance of such developments over the next year or two to
                            warrant especial US intelligence and planning attention.</p>
                        <p>The beginnings of a scramble for succession to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> are already evident. Should
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> leave the scene
                            in the near future, we believe that the initial struggle to replace him
                            would be won by Army and non-Communist elements, though Communists would
                            continue to play an important role. Such a government would probably
                            continue to be <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0258"/>anti-US,
                            xenophobic, and a threat to peace. Furthermore, unless the non-Communist
                            leaders displayed more backbone, effectiveness, and unity than they have
                            to date, the chances of eventual <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            dominance of Indonesia would quickly mount.</p>
                        <p>For the near future, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            will almost certainly continue his Confrontation policy. He might
                            sharply increase the level and intensity of Indonesian pressures against
                            Malaysia, precipitating war with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            Commonwealth forces; we believe it more likely, however, that he will
                            continue present patterns of infiltration and occasional military
                            probes, using large troop buildup and inflammatory threats essentially
                            for diplomatic blackmail.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will probably take
                            various rash actions to lessen his remaining ties with the West and to
                            continue his dalliance with Peiping. He apparently believes that
                            long-run trends are working to weaken US/Western influence in Southeast
                            Asia, that this provides Indonesia with the opportunity for considerable
                            profit, and that division of the spoils with Communist China is a
                            problem which can be safely managed at some later date. If persisted in,
                            these views will prove ill conceived and costly, susceptible of upset by
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/US force, Chinese Communist guile,
                            and domestic deterioration.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Harold Wilson</persName>'s long answer to
                            your letter about a <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">

                            arrived. As we rather expected, he takes a very dim view <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0259"/>of it, and my brother and I believe
                            that <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName> will share our view
                            that you would not wish to go ahead in these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Wilson</hi>'s argument is that a <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> visit to Washington would
                            be regarded as a triumph for his confrontation policy in Malaysia, and
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and in Indonesia. The British
                            obviously doubt that we could turn him around in any serious way, and
                            they point out—certainly correctly—that in the current state of British
                            opinion and deployment, there would be very harsh criticism of us from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName>Wilson</persName>'s letter also takes a very different view
                            from ours of the future inside Indonesia. They obviously think the army
                            will prove stronger than the P.K.I. when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> leaves the scene. If this is true, it is most
                            encouraging, and it is worth a second look here.</p>
                        <p>4. This message ties in quite neatly with the problem of getting Lodge to
                            the Far East. Our thought now is that you might invite him to go as an
                            informal representative to Kuala Lumpur and Djakarta and that from those
                            points he could easily be invited by Max Taylor for an informal visit in
                            Saigon. The whole expedition could be purely a matter of “having a
                            look,” and could be compared quite smoothly to his earlier visit to
                            third countries on behalf of Vietnam. This does not call for a decision
                            until I get back from Saigon, but I think it is quite a good idea for
                            the latter part of February. Lodge is alert and ready to go whenever you
                            want him.</p>
                        <p>5. All this of course is separate from the proposed <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> appointment, which will take a
                            little longer and which would be neatly balanced, in a sense, by having
                            Lodge take an informal travelling look-see that could include
                            reassurances to the Malaysians.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Anti-American activities in Indonesia, particularly those directed
                            against <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> during the last six
                            months, have created a situation that I can describe only as
                            intolerable. I believe that American interests and our national dignity,
                            not only in Indonesia but elsewhere, require that action now be taken to
                            indicate that we will not allow such actions to continue
                            unpenalized.</p>
                        <p>I realize that our long-suffering patience in these matters has been due
                            in large part to our desire to keep Indonesia out of the communist orbit
                            at virtually any cost, but it seems obvious that the Indonesian
                            government is abusing our patience to its advantage—and thus our present
                            predicament.</p>
                        <p>What is happening to <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in Indonesia
                            is obviously part of the much larger picture of U.S.-Indonesian
                            relations. It is apparent that the Indonesian government has decided to
                            apply to these relations its now well-established strategy of exerting a
                            steadily-increasing pressure on the official and private interests of
                            foreign countries with whose policies it does not agree with the
                            expectation that it can force a change in those policies. At present,
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> has been singled out for
                            special attention. We shall soon have nothing worthwhile left in the way
                            of an information operation. The pressures now being brought to bear on
                            American rubber estates in Sumatra indicate that these interests are
                            next on the list. Just as in the case of the Dutch, beginning in 1957,
                            and of the British, following the establishment of Malaysia in 1963,
                            this trend will continue either until we make the desired concessions to
                            the GOI or until nothing remains.</p>
                        <p>While <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> is rapidly being deprived of
                            its capacity for effective programming, it would be a serious mistake to
                            close down any of our operations voluntarily. Such an action would be
                            interpreted by both our enemies and friends as a retreat and as
                            knuckling under to communist pressure. And since no significant
                            differences appear to exist between the Government of Indonesia and the
                            Partai Kommunis Indonesia insofar as immediate objectives are concerned,
                            withdrawal on our part <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0262"/>could
                            only encourage further excesses against other American interests on the
                            part of the government. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> apparently has no future in Indonesia
                            under present conditions, I am prepared to sacrifice a part, or even
                            all, of our operation there if the Department is willing to take strong
                            and immediate action (1) to protest what has happened to date, and (2)
                            to put our opponents everywhere on notice that such actions inevitably
                            have a price tag attached to them.</p>
                        <p>While superficially we appear to have little leverage with the Indonesian
                            government, I am convinced that there are many courses of action open to
                            us. The following come immediately to mind:</p>
                        <p>1. The top Indonesian representative available should be called in and
                            bluntly informed that the activities which the Indonesian government has
                            been tolerating, encouraging and even engaging in are contrary to
                            established international and diplomatic custom and usage and that we do
                            not intend to continue to suffer such treatment without retaliating. The
                            press should be informed in advance that the Indonesians are being
                            called in, and we should encourage as wide dissemination of the
                            substance of our complaint as possible.</p>
                        <p>2. We should recall the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, making it clear
                            publicly that we do not intend to replace him until we have had some
                            satisfaction from the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Whatever remains in the way of a U.S. economic assistance program in
                            Indonesia, including training, the supplying of spare parts, civic
                            action, malaria eradication, etc., should be terminated immediately,
                            with attendant wide publicity.</p>
                        <p>4. Although the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s information and
                            cultural operation in this country is relatively small scale and hence
                            cannot be equated with <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> in
                            Indonesia, we should begin now to cut back certain of their activities
                            here.</p>
                        <p>While the purely information operation of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in this country has thus far been sporadic and largely
                            ineffectual, the greatest activity has taken place in New York, as a
                            part of the Indonesian Mission to the U.N. Following Indonesia's
                            decision to withdraw from the U.N. we thought for a time that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was planning to move this activity to
                            its consulate general in New York, a supposition which was supported by
                            the transfer of responsibility for publishing the Mission's bulletin,
                            “News and Views,” to the consulate general. However, the Permanent
                            Mission resumed issuance of the bulletin under its imprint at the end of
                            January. This obviously cannot continue after March 1, the date on which
                            Indonesia's connection with the U.N. terminates. We do not yet know
                            whether the consulate general will pick up the bulletin, or whether the
                            embassy here will assume responsibility for its publication (as the
                            consulate general information officer told one <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0263"/>of our people would be the case).
                            However, the embassy here has recently stepped up the issuance of its
                            own information bulletin from a sporadic to a regular basis of once a
                            week. Samples of Indonesian information output in this country are
                                attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Not attached to the source

                        </p>
                        <p>We are inclined to believe that with the departure of the Indonesian U.N.
                            Mission from New York, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will
                            probably attach greater importance to the remaining Indonesian presence
                            there than has hitherto been the case, primarily because of New York's
                            importance commercially and as the seat of the United Nations
                            headquarters, with its sizeable number of Afro-Asian representatives.
                            Therefore, the presence of the Indonesian Consulate General in New York
                            suggests some other interesting possibilities for retaliation. If our
                            information operation in Surabaya is closed down, we should ask the
                            Indonesians to withdraw their information people from New York.</p>
                        <p>If we deem it wise to close all <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            facilities in Indonesia and pull out our personnel, we should inform
                            Indonesia that we are expelling all Indonesians engaged in
                            informational, cultural, and other work of a nature done by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>. This would include several
                            Indonesians in Washington as well as some staff members in New York and
                            San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Because of the attacks on our Consulate proper in Medan and the
                            harassment of our Consul in Surabaya, we ought even explore the question
                            of whether we wish to close down our Consulate as well as the U.S.
                            Information Service in Surabaya and in turn ask the Indonesians to close
                            their entire New York operation.</p>
                        <p>I am fully aware that the recommendations that I have made are harsh, and
                            that some would produce an angry reaction on the part of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, February 19, <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_RCT1">Rowan</persName> planned to see President

                        <p>Dear <persName>Howard</persName>,</p>
                        <p>I hope that by the time this reaches Djakarta, both you and Mary Lou will
                            have returned.</p>
                        <p>First I want to tell you how deeply I appreciated your hospitality and
                            your help during my visit. Second, I want to tell you how much I missed
                            you during the last few days—especially at Boger. You will have seen the
                            cable reporting my talk with the Bung.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">Not
                                found.</note> Frank [<persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName>] will have filled you in on the peculiar
                            circumstances. I have never had such a talk with the President before.
                            We were both exhausted and we were alone virtually in the dark in that
                            vast hall of the Palace. We conversed for about an hour.</p>
                        <p>The Bung was gloomy but restrained and very frank. Although I left
                            depressed, I have since come to think that I caught a glimpse of the
                            depth of this man's understandable frustrations. In particular, I am
                            convinced that he would like to find a way out of his impasse with
                            K.[uala] L.[umpur]. His difficulty is how to do it.</p>
                        <p>I don't know what we can do at this juncture to help him. I rather think
                            it is something he will have to work out for himself.</p>
                        <p>I do have hope, however. My few talks in K.L. have convinced me that we
                            are moving into a period where the circumstances on both sides will
                            favor some form of negotiation. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> is more confident, and therefore more reasonable
                            by far, than he was last year. To some extent he finds confrontation
                            politically useful; but he is also aware that it increases his political
                            dependence upon the British which is beginning to irk him—particularly
                            in his relations with Singapore.</p>
                        <p>In Indonesia I felt that almost every leader—except Aidit—really wanted a
                                detente.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">In an official-informal letter,
                                February 25, <persName>Jones</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_FLMV1">Forrestal</persName> that he agreed that most
                                Indonesian leaders wanted a resolution of the Malaysian problem, but
                                internal pressures from the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                                would make it difficult for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to follow through on his desire for detente.
                                He also agreed that the U.S. Government should have made an effort
                                to restart the negotiations before the pressures from the internal
                                situation and the appeal of Hanoi and Beijing became so strong.
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> noted that the Embassy tried hard to
                                initiate early action. As for telecommunications equipment for the
                                Indonesian Army, <persName>Jones</persName> wanted to keep the U.S.
                                commitment, but he feared that time was running out. (Washington

                                6507, Defense 19–B)</note> I can't estimate the mood of the
                            population; but I <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0265"/>would suspect
                            that the mass of them do not particularly care one way or the other. In
                            brief, I think <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was
                            wrong when he said that the political climate in both K.L. and Djakarta
                            did not favor talks. I would hope that the current feelers would lead to
                            a Tokyo meeting which would in turn lead to the appointment of a
                            commission. This commission could talk and supervise direct talks for a
                            very long time—during which both sides might reduce their activities
                            along the border.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, there was a possibly important item which I failed to
                            report from K.L. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> made
                            quite a point about getting <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to say publicly that there were no longer any
                            guerrillas to be withdrawn from North Kalimantan. I admitted that the
                            Indos had said this privately (<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> told me this himself); but he insisted that a
                            public statement would go a long way to setting the stage for talks.</p>
                        <p>His reasoning apparently is that such a statement would remove the gun
                            from the head of the Malaysians since it would in fact be a
                            relinquishment of the Indonesian claim that there was a successful rebel
                            movement in the two territories. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> is so mercurial that I do not know whether to
                            take him seriously; but if it were possible to get <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_JY1">Jani</persName> to say that the question of
                            withdrawal of guerrillas was no longer an issue, you might get a good
                            response from K.L.</p>
                        <p>On the question of U.S.-Indo relations I am not optimistic—at least in
                            the short term. One of the prices we have to pay for our actions in
                            Viet-Nam is a certain amount of flak in Djakarta. These actions, I am
                            convinced, have had a very salutary effect on confrontation in both K.L.
                            and Indonesia. But there is inevitably some adverse side-effect.</p>
                        <p>Since, by the nature of things, we shall probably have to continue our
                            pressures in Vietnam, I think we will have to face a period of tension
                            while <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> tries to adjust
                            to the situation. In a way it's a shame we didn't start sooner—i.e.,
                            before <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> got caught in
                            his drift toward Hanoi and Peking.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I am inclined to believe that we should reduce our presence
                            temporarily. I realize that the P.K.I. will always find targets; but I
                            don't think we should give them unnecessary levers on our own public
                            opinion. Thus, I would get the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            mission down to a minimum and pull out our libraries.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I do think that we should let the Army have the Java
                            portion of the telecommunications equipment we promised them. Not only
                            would this tend to keep our lines clear to them; it would probably also
                            help them in the event there were trouble with the P.K.I. on Java.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, I would try to make our reduction as quiet and
                            normal-appearing as possible—I would also try to maintain as much
                            flexibility in coming back in again when conditions improve—hopefully
                            after a solution or abatement of the confrontation problem.</p>

                        <p>727. Crescendo of harassments against <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            establishment in Indonesia, culminating in attacks on Djakarta and Medan
                            libraries has brought us to stage where we will have to consider
                            constricting our relations with Indos to minimum unless <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> takes prompt steps to halt depredations
                            and restore situation. We recognize how this could conflict with our
                            long-range interests in Southwest Pacific, but point is at hand where
                            that consideration may have to give way to our inability tolerate such
                            treatment. Question is not only one of US public outrage at Indonesian
                            insults, but of virtual impossibility continuing do business with
                            Indonesia under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>In line with recent expressions by President and Secretary of growing
                            concern over mistreatment US diplomatic establishments abroad, we feel
                            it necessary to respond in tangible manner to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> directed or tolerated misconduct. For present we are
                            holding up $350,000 contribution to Bandung reactor, and are considering
                            other appropriate measures. We will, of course, bear in mind in
                            implementing these measures that large US private investment in
                            Indonesia is potential Indo hostage, while we have no equivalent.</p>
                        <p>To lessen our exposure and to demonstrate our concern, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> will propose further substantial
                            reduction in size of USAID mission in <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0267"/>Indonesia. Proposals subject separate

                                identified.</note> Question of <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> also under consideration.</p>
                        <p>With Ambassador scheduled return February 22, request Embassy advise
                            Palace that he will be returning with instructions from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and will seek appointment with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> immediately upon
                            return.</p>
                        <p>When Ambassador sees <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            he should make clear he speaking under instructions and should convey
                            following message in unmistakable terms: (a) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, including President himself, views these inexcusable
                            attacks on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> property with gravest
                            concern, and fears they will completely destroy useful relations between
                            us unless steps taken not only to halt them but to restore situation;
                            and (b) as minimum, we must insist that all forms discrimination against
                            US diplomatic community and violations accepted diplomatic standards
                            cease immediately (Ambassador knows what they are and should cite
                            them).</p>
                        <p>In ensuing discussion, Ambassador should draw on following points,
                            conveying them in manner best suited to atmosphere but indicating that
                            they being made under instructions:</p>
                        <p>1. Treatment <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> properties and
                            violations our diplomatic privileges has gone far beyond stage any
                            sovereign country can be expected accept. Despite this, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has hitherto exercised greatest
                            restraint because of our sincere desire prevent relations from further
                            deterioration and because we have been relying on repeated <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> assurances that seized properties would
                            be returned to us and harassments halted. These assurances so far have
                            proved valueless.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leaders have attempted portray these
                            excesses as expressions spontaneous anger at US policies for which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cannot be held responsible. We
                            cannot accept this portrayal, which in effect asks us to acknowledge
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> have lost control in their own country.
                            Facts are clear that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> itself has
                            taken lead in creating this deplorable atmosphere, not only by failing
                            to speak out for law and order but by publicly condoning and endorsing
                            mob violence.</p>
                        <p>3. GOI leaders have ventured suggest that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must itself share in task of halting these excesses by
                            modifying its policies in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>. We cannot
                            believe this suggestion advanced seriously. We prepared at any time to
                            discuss our policies with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, explain
                            our motives, and listen to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views.
                            These excesses, however, do not add to our appreciation of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> viewpoint and interests but diminish it
                            to vanishing point.</p>
                        <p>4. We particularly regret that Indonesians have used Viet-Nam situation
                            as excuse for latest series of outrages. We know <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> disagrees with our Viet-Nam policy. However, such
                            disagreements must in no way be allowed to result in destruction or
                            violation of diplomatic, <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0268"/>consular or any other property. Our actions in Viet-Nam stem from our
                            firm commitment to help South Viet-Nam defend itself against outside
                            aggression, and we determined to continue doing whatever is found
                            necessary to meet that commitment. No actions by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> or Indonesian mobs are going to change that situation
                            to slightest degree, and we are sorry to see <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> sacrificing our bilateral relations in fruitless,
                            undignified efforts to do so. (If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> takes this opportunity to debate our Viet-Nam
                            policy, you should draw on Depcirtels 1441, 1442, 1443, 1449 and

                        <p>5. We have now reached critical watershed in our relations with
                            Indonesia. We want better relations and we prepared do whatever we
                            reasonably can to achieve them. At present, however, we are at point
                            where we can do no more unless <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            responds by promptly restoring conditions which will permit us deal with
                            each other under tolerable conditions.</p>

                            seriously concerned that line Ambassador instructed take with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will worsen rather than
                            help basic situation. Recent deplorable attacks US installations here
                            are reflection rather than cause fundamental US-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> problem. Debate with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on Viet-Nam and other policy issues along lines
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> is not only futile but
                            will just anger him and probably increase our troubles. Country Team
                            convinced day when we can profitably try to argue Indos into accepting
                            our viewpoint on major world issues is, for the moment and hopefully
                            temporarily, past. <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0269"/>Believe we
                            should “agree to disagree” with GOI on China, Viet-Nam, Malaysia, Congo,
                            etc. We can, of course, discuss these problems but would be futile to
                            lay our prestige on line by attempting convince them we are right and
                            they wrong. Believe, however, we can and should attempt turn present
                            unfortunate situation to some advantage by shifting dialogue onto
                            preservation our bilateral relationships and seeking actions best
                            designed to do this.</p>
                        <p>Following additional factors underlie Country Team thinking:</p>
                        <p>1. If we seem attack and threaten Indos along lines <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> they will react adversely and
                            irrationally. We will not convince them, merely aggravate them.
                            Situation will continue to worsen, perhaps to breaking point.</p>
                        <p>2. With no real capacity for retaliation against Indo installations in
                            US, we only increase danger to our own establishment here by vague
                            threats and admonitions. We believe it important that USG retain
                            foothold in Indonesia. If present trends continue we will be put in
                            position sooner or later where we will have little alternative but to
                            retaliate against some Indo installations in US. Resulting tit-for-tat
                            exchange could eliminate US from Indonesia. As Dept aware, Indos are
                            hypersensitive in dealing with big Western power and perfectly capable
                            cutting own throats if they believe they being pressured.</p>
                        <p>3. We support delay in $350,000 contribution to Bandung reactor but fact
                            remains it is limited lever over <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, whereas if used punitively it will only hurt
                            and antagonize some of our friends here (especially Siwabessy).
                            Unilateral reduction size USAID as punitive measure similar. If this to
                            be done believe we should do it in way which gets at least some mileage
                            from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Despite what <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and others
                            have said, evidence is clear they do not want our <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> libraries, at least as they now
                            function, and have little interest in USAID. Same is probably true other
                            parts US installation. Indos seem be reaching point at which they
                            “tolerate” our programs because they think we want them and because up
                            to a point they want to avoid antagonizing us further. <gloss target="#t_reftel1">Reftel</gloss> seems imply we should press for
                            physical protection existing establishment by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. We agree but believe we should also examine that
                            establishment more closely to reduce difficulty of protection.</p>
                        <p>5. Would be unrealistic for us to insist on retention <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> libraries or other aspects our
                            programs directed toward Indo people when they are in such marked
                            contrast with what <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is telling its
                            own people. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has given us clear
                            signal on these libraries. We should recognize it.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite our policy differences with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, Country Team believes constructive discussion is
                            possible and necessary regarding our bilateral relations. We believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and many of his
                            top aides want avoid break with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                            Reasons for this complex but probably include <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0270"/>(a) fact that US is major world power
                            as well as power in Pacific; (b) <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            view that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may at some point be
                            useful in exerting influence on Brits; (c) belief US is still potent
                            source aid; and (d) though this seems be diminishing possible belief
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is useful as counter-ploy to
                            Communist China. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            often expressed and we believe sin- cere friendship for Americans as
                            individuals also should not be over- looked.</p>
                        <p>7. As result above analysis, Country Team believes our objectives should
                            be (a) quietly to reduce hostages (especially unengaged people in <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> aid and <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>); (b) eliminate those parts our establishment which
                            have become useless to us and source profitless friction with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>; and (c) try to convince Indos it in
                            our common interest to carry out (a) and (b) above in rational and
                            orderly manner and in way that will preserve our future bilateral
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>8. Approach which seeks reduce our presence here may actually stimulate
                            Indos to help preserve as much of our establishment as possible. Our
                            apparent readiness to take initiative may shock some Indos into
                            believing we are preparing to abandon them. This could rebound to our
                            benefit. Continued effort by us to avoid reductions in establish- ment
                            likely strengthen hand those who seek total elimination <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> presence.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, Country Team and I believe attacks on US installations and
                            other recent <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> actions are signal
                            Indos do not want us here in strength and form we now have. This not to
                            say attacks in any sense justified or should be condoned. What we mean
                            is that discussion should not be restricted solely to attacks and
                            ostensible reason for them (Viet-Nam). Rather these should be used as
                            springboard for far-reaching exploration seeking rational and realistic
                            basis for continued <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> relations. Numbered paras 1, 2 and 5 in
                            instructions (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>) seem fit within
                            this framework. Paras 3 and 4 would, I believe, be counterproductive. I
                            therefore urge Dept amend my instructions and authorize me make
                            following approach to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> (I would hope
                            see them together; if not I would go over same ground separately).<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">In telegram 731 to Djakarta, February 22, the

                                presentation subject to certain comments and observations. The
                                Department believed that Indonesia had moved from “agreeing to
                                disagree” to “riotsmanship” in its differences with the United
                                States over Vietnam. The Department hoped that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> “would not put the

                                prepared to defend and warned that the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs in Indonesia were under increasing
                                Congressional scrutiny and unless <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> desired termination or substantial

                        <p>3. These events have brought us to critical position. We want better
                            relations and are prepared do whatever we reasonably can to achieve
                            them. We believe <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> also wants maintain
                            constructive relations with us. However this mutual desire endangers
                            present situation in which we faced by intolerable attacks on our
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe we can and must seek position in which we can have honest
                            policy differences without excesses. One phase of present problem may be
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> view that US presence in Indo
                            too large and active and no longer reflects actual state our relations.
                            Seems to us this is what <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> trying tell
                            us by these repeated attacks on our installations.</p>
                        <p>5. If so we would like bring this into open so we can discuss on fal [<hi rend="italic">full</hi>?] and frank basis; otherwise, continuation
                            present trends may endanger more permanent aspects of our relationship.
                            We fully willing discuss reductions and adjustments in our programs and
                            installations if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> believes these
                            desirable. However we want to take these up in orderly way on
                            government-to-government basis and not as result mob attacks. These
                            attacks only complicate problem and make understanding more difficult. I
                            would then seek draw <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> out on <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and other US installations and
                            programs along lines set forth above. I would stress need for facing
                            problem openly and directly and would say that in view importance <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attaches to this issue I believe it
                            essential we have joint understanding on these matters within 30 days. I
                            would tell them I would report their views to my government and will
                            want to discuss matter further. I would, of course, make no commitments
                            at this time.</p>

                            return this afternoon and held for my signature. As Dept aware, I have
                            long held out for maintaining as complete US presence here as possible,
                            considering that closing down of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            installations would be heralded as <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            victory and swiftly result in further clipping away of US presence as
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> tacticians turn the heat on

                        <p>It is obvious, however, that if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> does
                            not want <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> to continue its activity
                            in its present form, we as guests in country have no choice but to
                            accept verdict. It is of vital importance to our bilateral relationship
                            that if utility of <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> operation
                            actually has diminished to point at which we are getting no returns on
                            our investment, whatever adjustment is to be made should be made in
                            manner to do least damage to totality of US position. This I and all of
                            Country Team consider can only be done by full and free frank discussion
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> without establishing

                        <p>Since the summer of 1964, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] has worked with the Department of State
                            in formulating concepts and developing an operational program of
                            political action in Indonesia aimed at bolstering the more moderate
                            elements in the Indonesian political spectrum to counter the growing
                            power of the Communist Party of Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). This program has been coordinated in the Department
                            of State with the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs and with
                            the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The aim of this political action program is to reduce the influence on
                            Indonesian foreign and domestic policies of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and the Government of Red China and to encourage and
                            support existing non-Communist elements within Indonesia. The program
                            envisages continuation of certain activities which have been undertaken
                            previously on a developmental basis plus other new activities which
                            appear now to offer <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0273"/>promise of
                            success if implemented on a coordinated and sustained basis. The main
                            thrust of this program is designed to exploit factionalism within the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> itself, to emphasize traditional
                            Indonesian distrust of Mainland China and to portray the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as an instrument of Red Chinese
                            imperialism. Specific types of activity envisaged include covert liaison
                            with and support to existing anti-Communist groups, particularly among

                        <p>One of the main factors bearing on the problem is the close affinity
                            between the current objectives of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Red China and the support provided to

                        <p>The requirement for a program of this type arose out of a series of

                        <p>Risks involved in this program include the possibility that were Sukarno
                            to learn of its existence and to suspect that one of the objectives of
                            the program is to weaken his control of Indonesian affairs, further
                            deterioration of relations between Indonesia and the United States could
                            result. An additional risk is the possibility that too blatant
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> activity is likely to
                            invite repressive measures on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s part, assisted by <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> attacks upon key anti-Communist leaders, with
                            concomitant further disarray within the non-Communist groups.
                            Nevertheless, it is believed that a program of this type should be
                            attempted.</p>

                            as well as bilateral US-Indonesia relations. His statements were
                            accompanied by vigorous complaints re treatment he was receiving <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0276"/>at hands US press and

                        <p>Meeting was unique in that there was no banter, hardly opportunity for
                            usual exchange of courtesies. Promptly at 0730 President excused himself
                            from group of courtiers and we got down to business at once. I reviewed
                            situation as it existed two weeks ago at time of my departure for
                            Manila, reminded President of promises he had made at that time,
                            deplored deterioration in Emb operating conditions and overall US-Indo
                            relationships since then and made points in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 727 as modified by subsequent exchanges with Dept. I
                            put up forcibly the proposition as to whether <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was going to let mob action destroy possibility of
                            satisfactory bilateral relations. I said I knew <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could control situation if
                            he made the effort although some of my people were now beginning to
                            challenge this. I told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that we took very serious view of situation,
                            that my government, including President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, views inexcusable attacks on <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> property with gravest concern and fears
                            they will completely destroy useful relations between us unless steps
                            are taken not only to halt them but to restore normal operating
                            conditions. In making points 1, 2 and 5 in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 727, in order impress him with fact we had about
                            reached point of no return, I drew <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> from my pocket and read him actual text of portions
                            of it. I then went on to suggest that we had reached stage where some
                            basic decisions were required. We could no longer continue on present
                            basis. We recognized that we were guests in Indonesia. Despite fact that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Libraries were established
                            with a view to improving relations and creating better understanding
                            between our two countries, we appeared to have reached point at which
                            these installations had become local point of contact [conflict?]. If
                            they were in fact not helping relations but rather reverse, perhaps we
                            should consider closing them down. It obviously made no sense to
                            continue effort which, aimed at creating understanding, was being
                            exploited by hostile elements uncontrolled by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to exacerbate relations between us.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that we both consider this possible course of action from
                            point of view of what was best for US-Indo bilateral relations and if it
                            seemed closing <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> installations was
                            the answer, then decision should be reached on basis mutual
                            understanding and implementation carried out in cooperative manner
                            calculated to do least harm to our relations.</p>

                        <p>President responded by nodding his head thoughtfully, indicating he
                            wished to think matter over carefully. He said he would talk to me again
                            about it in near future. I told him that conditions were currently
                            intolerable and that I felt basic decision had to be reached in very
                            near future as to whether libraries were to be closed and our books sent
                            home or whether libraries were to be reopened. I reminded him that we
                            had earlier discussed possibility of reopening Jogjakarta Library as
                            gesture toward improved relations. I asked him to set a date for further
                            discussion of this matter.</p>
                        <p>I then went on to summarize other harassments to which we had recently
                            been subject, including specific mention of difficulties in utilization
                                <gloss target="#t_ALUSNA1">ALUSNA</gloss> aircraft, harassment at
                            airport in connection with receipt and delivery of <gloss target="#t_APO1">APO</gloss> mail, threatening circular letters
                            addressed to American and Indonesian employees of Embassy and other
                            unpleasantnesses. Under current circumstances, US Embassy was being
                            harassed and discriminated against in violation of all international
                            customs and usage to point where we could not conduct our normal
                            business. I also mentioned <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s trip to Medan and said that I had been
                            informed that this trip represented first step in takeover rubber
                            estates.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> vehemently denied
                            this, said shoe was on other foot, that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> was proceeding to Medan
                            accompanied by Sudibjo of National Front, in effort to guard and protect
                            American properties. As to other harassments, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that he would do
                            everything he could. As first step, he summoned his aide as reported
                            above, and gave him specific instructions to notify local authorities in
                            Jogjakarta, Surabaya and Djakarta that we should have access to <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> Libraries. At same time <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said American Government
                            was making it very difficult for him in his relationships with his own
                            people because of our policies in Asia. I responded that America and
                            Indonesia would be neighbors in the Pacific for centuries to come and
                            that regardless of differences of views on such current issues as
                            Vietnam, Malaysia, the Congo, etc. it seemed self-evident that it was in
                            interest of both countries to maintain friendly bilateral relations and
                            that these relations should not be impaired by mob action condoned by
                            governmental authorities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> admitted that he
                            regarded action against <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> as
                            retaliatory for US press attacks against him and Indonesia. He mentioned
                            several examples to which he objected including recent Newsweek cover
                            story. He said we always hid behind our freedom of the press but that
                            unfriendly attacks on head of state by American journalists had same
                            effect in Indonesia as demonstrations against <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> installations had in US. I pointed out obvious
                            difference between two—<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had the power to control press and mobs in
                            Indonesia whereas our government <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0278"/>did not have the power to control our press which was reacting to
                            unjustified attacks on American property. “Can't your people understand
                            that I am hurt, personally hurt, by these press attacks?” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked. I reminded him that
                            some of the greatest idols in American history including Presidents
                            Lincoln, Roosevelt and <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            had been maligned by American press. He was no exception.</p>
                        <p>I drew conversation back to practical situation which called for
                            immediate remedy. I suggested that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> make public statement clarifying <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> responsibility under international law
                            for protection of foreign persons and property and reminding his people
                            that disagreements between nations did not warrant such hostile actions
                            as we were currently experiencing. I concluded by repeating that this
                            situation could not be allowed to drift any longer and that I felt we
                            should shortly reach discussion as to future of American presence in
                            Indonesia. I urged him to consider seriously how <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> problem should be handled and
                            requested further appointment to follow up our discussions today later
                            this week. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> agreed and
                            set up appointment for [garble—meeting?] Feb 26.</p>
                        <p>Without committing himself specifically, he again promised to do
                            everything he could to improve situation but asked me to appeal to
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to move carefully in Asia and to
                            do anything we could do to improve unfair and distorted press treatment
                            of Indonesia and himself.</p>
                        <p>Sukarno comments on <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> subject in
                            separate telegram.<note n="7" xml:id="d111fn7">In telegram 1662 from

                                absolutely unfounded.” According to <persName>Jones</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was
                                unconvinced, referring to the “invisible government.” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> stated that
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> was not a party to nor aware of these
                                clandestine operations. When <persName>Jones</persName> asked
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to show him
                                documentary evidence, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> retorted it was no use because anything

                                    <persName>Jones</persName> concluded, “We left it at that.”

                            headed for a very sharp cut-down in all our activities and we are going
                            to announce our plans when they are clear. The way we do it makes a good
                            deal of difference in whether we get back in at a later time and
                                <persName>Jones</persName>' role at this point. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thought we should be
                            taking the initiative in cutting down. <persName>Bundy</persName> said
                            we are prepared to but we should do it as gently as possible for the

                            considered possible retaliatory action against <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and have reached following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. While there some chance serious discussions with influential Indos
                            (particularly military) of what US can and will do unless <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> stops its harassments US installations
                            would be effective, we doubt on balance that such a move would evoke
                            desired response. On contrary it would probably only tend confirm and
                            accelerate direction <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> have chosen
                            for Indo policy, i.e. de facto and hopefully temporary alliance with
                            Peiping and Hanoi. We not at all hopeful Indo military, faced with
                            virtual ultimatum from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, would take
                            action to force change in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policies
                            or personnel. More likely, they would be swept under in wave intense
                            nationalism against foreign intervention propelled by personal
                            emotionalism <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and
                            others.</p>
                        <p>2. On balance, we believe <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would lose
                            more than it would gain by responding to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> harassments in kind. While it might be self-satisfying
                            for the moment to close Indo information programs in US, this would
                            clearly preclude us from carrying on any info or cultural programs at
                            our Embassy here. Similarly, economic retaliatory measures suggested
                            reftel would not seriously affect Indo economy but would only drive
                            Indos closer to Communist Bloc and accelerate takeover remaining
                            US-owned enterprises (oil companies) here. Real punitive measures also
                            highly inadvisable while we have so many hostages in Indo.</p>
                        <p>3. Only effective retaliation we have is in military field. Show of
                            military force against Indonesia would undoubtedly impress Indos but
                            would, of course, create whole new situation presumably calling for
                            cashing by Indo of commitments ChiComs have allegedly made to them.
                            Situation does not yet warrant taking that risk. Over longer run we
                            believe military and other actions which show clear evidence US
                            determination hold fast in nearby free world areas such as S. Vietnam,
                            Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines will have salutary effect on Indo
                            behavior.</p>
                        <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0281"/>
                        <p>4. While we not in favor of punitive retaliation against <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, do believe it essential we make rapid
                            but orderly adjustments in our establishment and programs to reflect
                            present inhospitable situation.</p>
                        <p>These matters are currently under thorough inter-agency discussion here
                            and specific recommendations as to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, Peace Corps, <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>, etc, will be forwarded
                            separately.</p>
                        <p>Wish emphasize these adjustments should be on orderly basis without
                            appearance this punitive action. Otherwise our problems will be
                            increased and we will probably find it impossible get our equipment and
                            material out. If Department concurs this course of action believe it
                            important also that Congress be briefed fully and urged refrain from
                            provocative statements which will only compound our problems here.</p>
                        <p>Important thing is to avoid dramatizing this reduction in way which may
                            bring violent Indo reaction resulting in danger to US personnel and
                            possibility of undignified route similar to British exit year and half

                        <p>1428. Kuala Lumpur's 1109.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">In telegram 1109
                                from Kuala Lumpur, March 5, <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> suggested that Department officials talk to the
                                British about an <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> in which
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would choose
                                Pakistan or Cambodia, the Philippines would designate Thailand at
                                U.S. urging, and Malaysia would consider Nigeria as their candidate.
                                (Ibid.)</note> Department's attitude toward current motions in
                            direction negotiation Indo-Malaysian dispute has been as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We have continued believe bilateral contacts between senior officials
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> could be useful to help locate areas within <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0282"/>which agreement possible, and to
                            prevent Indos from claiming <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> avoiding
                            settlement. We therefore encouraged <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> to support or at least not deter
                                <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. For same reasons we have not opposed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            meeting, subject qualification that at that level meeting would be less
                            formal, would lose some of flavor of “contact” and would take on air of
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>3. We have not wanted sponsor negotiations at this point because we think
                            they will inevitably lead to some version of <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> idea, and we think it would be premature and perhaps
                            dangerous for <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> to accept such vague
                            concept until preliminary quiet contacts have established more precisely
                            what is meant.</p>
                        <p>4. While there are advantages in <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>,
                            as idea stands undefined at present, it has these dangers: Sukarno has
                            publicly stated and reiterated that he will accept any solution proposed
                            by <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss>. This is fine public position,
                            but at same time various Indo diplomats have recently confirmed what we
                            have previously assumed, which is that Indos would insist that <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> work on basis consensus unless, of
                            course, they had pro-Indo majority. At least Indo nominee would not
                            accept position which too hard for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            to swallow, and other Asians would be most unlikely incur Indo enmity by
                            pushing too hard for such position. We thus feel we could rule out idea
                            that <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> would confirm <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ascertainment and certify Malaysia as
                            pure. <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> would be left with choice of
                            recognizing inability reach agreement or of coming up with some new form
                            of “testing will of people of North Kalimantan.” This being case, we
                            think that what form this testing procedure would take must be worked
                            out informally between <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> before concept accepted. Otherwise,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> is likely to be faced with
                                <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> recommendation for plebiscite
                            which it might feel it had to reject, thus giving ball game to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. As far as Phils are concerned, we have felt they have no place in
                            bilateral contacts because their presence reintroduces Borneo claim,
                            because their method of operation via press leak has been dramatically
                            unhelpful, and because Indos have been most successful in using them as
                            divisive element in past. At same time, if matters proceed past
                            bilateral stage in trilateral meeting, we think it important that they
                            be fully aware of situation and our views of it in hope we can mitigate
                            disadvantages inherent in their presence. This produces dilemma: if we
                            talk to them too fully and too soon we may encourage their desire
                            attend, while if we leave them out too long we may have uninformed and
                            destructive Philippine involvement.</p>
                        <p>At this stage we inclined think we should not push Phils until it clear
                            that tripartite meeting is inevitable. We expect, however, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> or Mendez or both
                            will want <persName>Bundy</persName>'s views on Indo-Malaysian <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0283"/>negotiations, and recognize
                            subject cannot be by-passed. If this happens, suggest Ambassador and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> might give briefing on current status of
                            contacts, drawing on points 1 to 4 above, and endorsing <gloss target="#t_AACC1">AACC</gloss> structure outlined Kuala Lumpur's
                            1109, with which we fully agree.</p>

                            additional steps to promote recently reiterated Sukarno desire continue
                                <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> in Indonesia. This subject
                            currently under discussion with FonMin; response we receive will be
                            significant test <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> determination keep
                                <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> here in spite of current
                            atmosphere. Without some strong Sukarno support to regional govts we
                            believe unlikely <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> can continue operate
                            effectively under any circumstances. Do not believe any evacuation
                            required at this time; physical safety <gloss target="#t_PCVS1">PCVS</gloss> not seriously in question whereas any such moves would
                            signal drive to oust all <gloss target="#t_PCVS1">PCVS</gloss>. Will
                            keep this under constant review and notify Dept soonest if situation

                            close-out to be in US interest, however, believe we should consider
                            deactivation of <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> as such and
                            establishment within Embassy of “Special Assistant to Ambassador for
                            Defense Liaison Activities.” This Defense Liaison Group to have mission
                            maintain US military presence, perform <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and civic action residual function, maintain direct
                            link to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, and provide base for future expansion
                            of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or other Defense activities
                            should such expansion become desirable. Organization should include
                            officer representation from each service dept, personnel to perform
                            continuing specialized functions, and minimum clerical and
                            administrative support. Believe this can be accomplished with eight
                            military personnel (5 officers and 3 enlisted), which includes spaces
                            for Signal Corps officer to supervise Philco contract, army schools
                            liaison officer at Bandung, and enlisted radio man to support military
                            communications system at the Embassy. Believe reduction below numbers
                            proposed above should not be considered until requirements are further
                            reduced or until further reduction is made necessary by actions of
                            Indonesian Govt. This represents drastic cut from present <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> strength of 25 enlisted men and
                            officers. Proposed organizations will be covered in greater detail in

                        <p>4. Evacuation. Do not believe advisable yet move into formal phase of E
                            and E plan. To do so would almost inevitably leak to Indonesian
                            community and complicate our problems; at very best such action would
                            add to morale problems in American community. What I need in face this
                            unpredictable situation is standby authority to (a) authorize advance
                            travel for dependents who would like to leave on voluntary basis, (b)
                            advance authorization to ship HHE, if necessary, and we strongly
                            recommend CONUS as safehaven (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                                798),<note n="6" target="d115fn6">Not found.</note> (c) use foreign
                            flag vessels if American shipping not available. Embassy believes it
                            would also be wise, on contingency basis, to select and make <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0286"/>other necessary preliminary
                            arrangements for representation of US interests in Indonesia by third
                            power. (I would think that Japanese Embassy here would be one of few
                            here with sufficient staff and standing with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to do this effectively—would welcome Dept's comments.)

                        </p>
                        <p>Reconstituted programs outlined above based on strong belief it in US
                            interest, at least until game progresses a bit further, to maintain
                            nucleus <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> and USAID (possibly
                            under other names) along lines outlined above for residual reporting
                            responsibilities and other situations that may develop. Number of events
                            could alter present direction Indo politics and provide renewed openings
                            for US initiative. Among these are (a) possible replacement of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> through death or
                            incapacitation; (b) possible army move to stem present trends; or (c)
                            conceivably shift of Malaysian confrontation out of military arena. None
                            of these at all certain but all possible. More likely is hope, as stated
                            Embtel 1643 that with less conspicuous and smaller mission here <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will find it easier to protect us and
                            that our relations will accordingly, and despite continued foreign
                            policy differences, be eased. This assumes of course <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> desires continued relations. While this
                            also not certain, believe it clearly in US national interest to continue
                            on this assumption until situation clarifies way in which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> cooperates in orderly withdrawal of
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> installations will provide
                            barometer for future action across board. If we are successful in
                            closing down <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> without exacerbation
                            already difficult situation, I propose that I have frank discussion with

                            programs in effort reach understanding. Do not believe we should move
                            too fast with actions which will be interpreted by Indos as retaliatory.
                            Let us have our plans ready so as to be able move fast if necessary and
                            desirable but take soundings as we go. As Dept aware, stakes in game are
                            high and we should not burn any bridges before absolutely necessary.</p>

                                reported that he had informed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> that he had received assurances from the
                                    “<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Head for the Far East” that
                                there were no anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and anti-Indonesia subversive operations.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> admitted
                                that he had no reliable evidence to the contrary, but
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> was still convinced that only a
                                personal denial by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> would “carry full weight.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is psychopathic on
                            this score and he has been assured, reassured and re-re-assured to no
                            avail. He seems to enjoy this death-wish and appears to use it to
                            justify to himself and to others any of his anti-American acts.</p>
                        <p>A high-level meeting should not be dismissed out-of-hand, but if it takes
                            place I think a scenario along this line should be worked out:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName>Jones</persName> leaves for East-West Center.</p>
                        <p>(2) <persName>Jones</persName> invites <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as old friend to his induction ceremonies in
                            Honolulu.</p>
                        <p>(3) The President (Vice President?) decides to attend himself because of
                            his friendship for <persName>Jones</persName>, because of the
                            significance of the E–W Center in our Asian policy, because he has never
                            been to the 50th State since he became President.</p>
                        <p>(4) The President takes this occasion to meet for an hour or so with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0288"/>But two points should be mentioned:</p>
                        <p>(1) I don't think we can expect anything much to emerge from such a
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>(2) I believe the Department (at least <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>)
                            is opposed to the idea. See attached memo for some further thoughts on

                                That.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Reference is to a 4-page
                                unattributed paper, March 10, which recommended “a carrot and stick
                                proposition” to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                since U.S.-Indonesian relations were at a crossroads and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> must choose which fork
                                to travel. The memorandum recommended as carrots a Presidential
                                letter to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> written
                                “more in sorrow than in anger,” a visit by <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Robert Kennedy</persName> to offer U.S. good
                                services to mediate the dispute with Malaysia, and the prospect of
                                additional U.S. economic assistance. The United States would pass
                                the word to moderate politicians and military leaders that the U.S.
                                offer was their last chance. Should Indonesians reject the offer,
                                the United States would increase the pressure by giving military
                                assistance to the British and Malaysians including U.S. advisers.
                                Should Indonesia persist in aggression against Malaysia, the United
                                States should use air and naval power against Indonesian supply
                                lines and back “independence” movements in the outer islands.

                            temporarily stabilizing the situation.</p>
                        <p>2. He could make use of his own prestige with the Indonesians (you will
                            recall he was the man who negotiated the West New Guinea settlement) to
                            try to get a commitment from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to take a more moderate course.</p>
                        <p>3. He would be able to recommend the decisions we may be forced to make
                            regarding the further evacuation of personnel; the handling of the
                            problem of the oil companies, etc.</p>
                        <p>If you think well of this idea, we will prepare a draft letter from you
                            to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> could deliver.
                            Meanwhile, the mere fact that Sukarno knew that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> was proposing to visit Djakarta
                            on your behalf could have a stabilizing effect.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> is seeing you
                            at 1 p.m. today in connection with his mission to Indonesia. He is
                            seeking general guidelines from you on the purpose of his trip. He will
                            be leaving for Djakarta this weekend and will probably stay for a week
                            or ten days.</p>
                        <p>2. As you know, <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> was deeply
                            involved in the Indonesian problem when he served successfully as United
                            Nations Mediator for the West Irian (West New Guinea) dispute between
                            the Indonesians and the Dutch in 1962. He is devoting this week to an
                            intensive updating on the current state of U.S.-Indonesia relations.</p>
                        <p>3. We would suggest that you stress the following points in your talk
                            with the Ambassador:</p>
                        <p>(1) It is clearly in our interest to do what we can to arrest Indonesia's
                            apparent drift into the Communist camp under the auspices of the
                            Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). At
                            stake are 100 million people, vast potential resources, and a
                            strategically important chain of islands.</p>
                        <p>(2) There is disagreement both in our Djakarta Embassy and in Washington
                            as to (a) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s real
                            intentions; (b) the Indo power balance between Communists and
                            non-Communists; and (c) what the U.S. can and should do—some recommend a
                            “deep freeze” for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            &amp; Co.; others believe in a continued effort to win back their
                            interest and friendship. You want his best judgment on these points.</p>
                        <p>(3) You would therefore like him to consult in depth with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>, with other members of
                            the Country Team, with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and with a broad spectrum of top Indonesian
                            officials.</p>

                        <p>In an April 23, 1965, letter to Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern
                            Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Howard Jones</persName> stated that he
                            was “privy to plans for a coup here and write you to inform you of the
                            possibility.” <persName>Jones</persName> stated that he had informed
                            only one other person in Djakarta, Edward E. Masters, the head of the
                            Embassy's political section, “because any indication that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> even knows about this could be the kiss
                            of death not only to the effort itself, but to those involved.”
                                <persName>Jones</persName> also told <persName>Bundy</persName>, “to
                            play safe, I informed my contact that the U.S. Government can in no way
                            participate in any effort of this kind. I nevertheless conveyed clearly
                            my own sympathy with his objectives.” <persName>Jones</persName> went on
                            to explain that the tentative plans contemplated action in late May or
                            June when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was out of
                            the country and suggested that <persName>Bundy</persName> might want to
                            share this information with the President. He told
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>, “I should caution that we do not yet
                            know how seriously the plans are to be taken.” Jones assured
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> that his information was based on
                            “personal contact with one of the leaders of the coup group which
                            represents important civil and military elements.” (Johnson Library,
                            National Security File, Country File, Indonesia, Vol. IV, Memos,
                            3/65–9/65)</p>
                        <p>Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Leonard Unger
                            sent this letter to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> at the White House suggesting that “he should be
                            aware of this and you may wish to alert the President, although the
                            information contained is obviously far from firm.” (Memorandum from
                            Unger to <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, May 3;
                            ibid.) There is no indication that the President was informed.</p>
                        <p>As it turned out, <persName>Jones</persName>' information proved to be
                            “far from firm.” <persName>Jones</persName> left Indonesia on May 24,
                            1965. On May 25 <persName>Jones</persName> cabled the Department of
                            State from Bangkok in telegram 1879, that “plans referred to in my
                            letter maturing slowly” and that “earlier it appeared as though some
                            action against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            government might be attempted while he was out of the country within the

                        <p>1. Because of the factors mentioned below Indonesian-American relations
                            are unlikely to improve in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. Ostensible reasons advanced by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for the deterioration of Indo-U.S. relations
                            are:</p>
                        <p>a) U.S. recognition and support of Malaysia, as evidenced by the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> communique<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">For text of

                        <p>b) Our “intervention” in South Vietnam and support of the government

                        <p>c) U.S. presence and bases in that part of the world. </p>
                        <p>3. Other and more fundamental reasons for the present state of Indo-U.S.
                            relations which will continue to affect them adversely are:</p>
                        <p>a) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s ambition to
                            solidify the Afro-Asian nations in a struggle of the NEFOS (New Emerging
                            Forces) against the OLDEFOS (Old Established Forces) and to occupy
                            himself a dominant position in the struggle;</p>
                        <p>b) Characterization of the West as representative of neo-colonialism and
                            imperialism (<gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss>), therefore as
                            the enemy of the newly independent countries. The U.S. as the most
                            powerful leader of the developed countries is identified as enemy No.
                            1;</p>
                        <p>c) The influence of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> (Communist
                            Party of Indonesia), which looks to Peking for inspiration and whose
                            avowed purpose is to drive the U.S. out of Indonesia;</p>
                        <p>d) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s proclaimed
                            Marxism and his avowed intention of doing away with capitalism in the
                            process of socializing Indonesia;</p>
                        <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>e) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s view that
                            creation of national unity and a sense of national identity are more
                            important than economic development; hence his emphasis on the
                            “romanticism of revolution”, and external issues to involve the
                            emotional response of his people;</p>
                        <p>f) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s confidence that
                            he can bend the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to his will; hence
                            his emphasis on NASOKOM, the unification of the national, the religious
                            and the communist elements into a national consensus;</p>
                        <p>g) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s mystical belief
                            in his own destiny, hence his conviction that it is his mission to lead
                            his country to unity and power; and because of doubts about his health,
                            to accelerate the process. 4. While the settlement of the Malaysia
                            problem directly, and that of Southeast Asia indirectly, might remove
                            some tension in Indo-U.S. relations, it is probable that these will be
                            under strain for a considerable period because of the factors enumerated
                            above.</p>
                        <p>5. There are, however, elements of strength in the situation, but which
                            at present find it expedient not to oppose the party line. These, which
                            numerically outnumber the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, are:</p>
                        <p>a) The military, especially the army;</p>
                        <p>b) Moderate moslem political organizations;</p>
                        <p>c) Other moderate political elements now inactive. 6. The military,
                            because of the widespread emotional popular support for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policy of confrontation
                            with Malaysia, and because of their adherence to constitutionality,
                            support the confrontation policy.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, however, that the military understands that:</p>
                        <p>a) It cannot win a war with Malaysia as long as the latter has British
                            backing;</p>
                        <p>b) A defeat would seriously damage its prestige domestically, hence
                            increase relatively the strength of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>; </p>
                        <p>c) Would therefore prefer a settlement which would permit troops to
                            return to Indonesia to be prepared for a future confrontation with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and other extremists. </p>
                        <p>7. In terms of internal political power it is not in the U.S. interest to
                            see the military defeated. Such a result, however, would not be
                            unwelcome to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> which would like to
                            discredit the present military leadership.</p>
                        <p>8. Sectors of the moslem population are increasingly restive over the
                            growing power of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Clashes
                            between these elements have already taken place in east and central Java
                            and Sumatra.</p>
                        <p>9. A large and widespread U.S. presence provides the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and other extremist elements targets
                            for attack.</p>
                        <p>A defense of the U.S. presence, even by the forces of law and order, is
                            embarrassing to them and to those friendly to the U.S. since it subjects
                            them to attack as defenders or stooges of the imperialists.</p>
                        <p>10. U.S. visibility should be reduced so that those opposed to the
                            communists and extremists may be free to handle a confrontation, <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0295"/>which they believe will come,
                            without the incubus of being attacked as defenders of the
                            neo-colonialists and imperialists.</p>
                        <p>11. Within the limitations imposed by the preceding paragraph the U.S.
                            should maintain contact with the constructive elements of strength in
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>12. Indonesia essentially will have to save itself. U.S. policy should be
                            directed toward creating conditions which will give the elements of
                            potential strength the most favorable conditions for confrontation.</p>
                        <p>13. The struggle for succession has already begun. First Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, devious
                            and untrustworthy, is in the lead, following the communist line in an
                            endeavor to use the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as a political
                            base.</p>
                        <p>14. If <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> were to
                            succeed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in the near
                            future there is a probability that the military would try to force his
                            retirement.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is still the
                            symbol of Indonesian unity and independence, believes in himself and his
                            destiny, and is able and shrewd. There is little question of his
                            continued hold on the loyalty of the Indonesian people, who in large
                            measure look to him for leadership, trust his leadership, and are
                            willing to follow him. No force in the country can attack him nor is
                            there evidence that any significant group would want to do so.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has, however,
                            increasingly shown a tendency to take positions consistently favoring
                            the pro-communist forces. Unless he moves to restore the balance, the
                            drift toward communist domination of the country will continue.</p>
                        <p>17. The Indonesian economy:</p>
                        <p>a) Has not been effectively exploited since the country proclaimed its
                            independence in 1945;</p>
                        <p>b) Development planning has been inept, and is today virtually
                            non-existent;</p>
                        <p>c) Over half the population live outside the monetized sector of the
                            economy as self-sufficient farmers, a fact which accounts for the
                            resilience to economic adversity demonstrated by Indonesia over the last
                            two decades;</p>
                        <p>d) Inflation has been widespread and inflationary forces continue to
                            exert an upward pressure on prices;</p>
                        <p>e) The government occupies a dominant position in basic industry, public
                            utilities, internal transportation and communication;</p>
                        <p>f) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> emphasized in his
                            speech on April 11 that his concept of “guided economy” includes a
                            speeding-up of the process of socializing the country;</p>
                        <p>g) It is probable that foreign private ownership will disappear and may
                            be succeeded by some form of production-profit-sharing contract
                            arrangements to be applied to all foreign investment;</p>
                        <p>h) The avowed Indonesian objective is “to stand on their own feet” in
                            developing their economy, free from foreign, especially Western,
                            influence.</p>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>18. Since <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> occupies a
                            dominant and virtually unchallenged position of leadership, Indo-U.S.
                            relations will be largely what he wishes them to be, while he remains in
                            power.</p>
                        <p>19. There are, as noted above, moderate elements which are in contention
                            to succeed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Whether
                            they will be able to do so will depend on their own strength and unity,
                            and to some extent on our relations with them and with Indonesia during
                            the remainder of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            regime.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Part 2: Recommendations</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General </p>
                        <p>1. Because of Indonesia's importance and potential strength, we should
                            seek to retain a continued presence in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>2. Where aspects of our presence in Indonesia provide targets easily
                            exploitable by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, they should be
                            quietly removed.</p>
                        <p>3. Our major effort should be directed toward influencing long-range
                            developments in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>4. In dealing with the present regime we should continue to emphasize our
                            desire for friendly relations while recognizing the fact that the nature
                            of our relations depends primarily on what the Government of Indonesia
                            wishes them to be. Accepting the fact that our bilateral relations are
                            presently unsatisfactory we should, to the extent possible, continue the
                            effort to work with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and maintain a dialogue between him and the President.</p>
                        <p>5. We should try to maintain as much contact with as many other elements
                            in Indonesia, both of current and potential importance, as circumstances
                            permit.</p>
                        <p>6. We should avoid taking actions which appear to be punitive. We should
                            also recognize the fact that public castigation of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime produces no
                            restraining effect in Indonesia, but on the contrary tends to intensify
                            our problems there.</p>
                        <p>7. We should quietly but effectively, using wherever possible the agency
                            of third countries, oppose Indonesia's efforts to turn the
                            Afro-Asian-Latin American countries into an anti-American bloc.</p>
                        <p>8. Because the ideal of national unity is an overriding obsession with
                            practically all Indonesians, stronger by far than any real divisive
                            regional feeling, we should avoid becoming involved in efforts to split
                            off Sumatra or other areas from Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>9. We should continue to avoid direct involvement in both the military
                            and diplomatic aspects of the Malaysian problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific </p>
                        <p>1. The security situation as it affects dependents of American personnel
                            should be kept under constant review. An unpublicized and <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0297"/>temporary freeze should be put on the
                            travel of dependents of newly assigned personnel going to Djakarta until
                            at least May 15, the situation to be re-assessed at that time. We should
                            also establish Indonesia as in Phase I of Emergency and Evacuation
                            planning without, however, any general circulation of this fact beyond a
                            need-to-know basis.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. has an unfulfilled commitment to the Indonesian Army,
                            involving the personal position of Army Chief General Yani, to complete
                            the fixed communications project on which the Indonesian Army has
                            expended some $10 million. If this project is not completed General Yani
                            will be placed in a very vulnerable position which, in turn, will have
                            an adverse effect on the Army's attitude toward the U.S. and its ability
                            to resist the Communist Party. Unless an acceptable proposal for the
                            Indonesian Army's acquisition of the equipment through commercial
                            channels can be made to General Yani, the U.S. should complete the now
                            reduced project under the Military Assistance Program.</p>
                        <p>3. Other than completing the foregoing project, we should not contemplate
                            further deliveries under the Military Assistance Program. In order to
                            keep maximum contact with the Indonesian military we should retain a few
                            selected officers of the military assistance training group, either as a
                            part of the attache staff or as a separate unit within the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>4. Although new money should not be sought from Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966, a skeleton <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> staff should be maintained at least as long as <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-administered activities continue. If
                            all such activities are terminated, the question of maintenance of a
                            skeleton staff should be reviewed.</p>
                        <p>5. The University contracts should be continued so long as there is not a
                            marked increase in the general security threat to Americans and so long
                            as they are able to operate.</p>
                        <p>6. The Harbor Construction Project, a development loan granted well
                            before Indonesia began its military confrontation against Malaysia, is
                            well along, and involves a commitment by the U.S. Government both to the
                            Government of Indonesia and to the company which has the contract.
                            Defaulting on this commitment, a punitive action on our part, would not
                            only reflect unfavorably on the U.S. but would put in jeopardy some
                            $500,000 worth of equipment owned by the American company. We should try
                            to complete this project.</p>
                        <p>7. An information program under the aegis of the Embassy should be
                            pursued and, if possible, expanded with the objective of keeping a
                            window open for U.S. influence with Indonesian leaders, particularly
                            those among the youth. The recent proposal by <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> involving the assignment of two officers and 16 locals
                            to the Embassy and the two Consulates seems a reasonable beginning.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In the course of my visit to Indonesia—a stay of one day more than two
                            weeks—I had four meetings with President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, two other meetings with First Deputy Prime
                            Minister and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, and I also called on a number of other
                            ministers in influential positions. Additionally, I lunched once with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at the
                            Palace in Djakarta and in turn entertained him once at a luncheon at the
                            Embassy Residence in Djakarta. At his request I also went to Bandung to
                            hear his speech at the opening session of the Consultative Assembly. In
                            addition, I obtained the views of a number of ambassadors accredited to
                            Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>In the talks with President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and members of his government I endeavored
                            consistently to make a number of points about our general concept of
                            United States relations with Indonesia and in turn to elicit from
                            Indonesians their views of present and future relations with the United
                            States. I avoided to the extent possible becoming involved in
                            operational questions which I felt would be more appropriately handled
                            by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The following are the aspects of United States policy toward Indonesia
                            which I particularly stressed in my talks with Indonesian leaders:</p>
                        <p>1. I said that I had come to Indonesia at the request of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> who had become
                            concerned by the recent deterioration of relations between Indonesia and
                            the United States, and who had expressed to me his wish to enter into a
                            closer dialogue with President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in which American attitudes and Indonesian views
                            might better be understood by both sides. I emphasized that neither the
                            President nor I considered my visit to be a “last ditch” effort, but
                            rather an aspect of continuing communication between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>2. I made clear that the United States seeks a friendly and constructive
                            relationship with Indonesia to the extent that this kind of relationship
                            also is desired and would be supported by the Indonesian Government. I
                            stressed that the United States has no territorial or other ambitions in
                            the Far Eastern region. When talking to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, I assured him most clearly
                            that the United States Government is not working against him personally
                            and does not seek his removal from power.</p>
                        <p>3. I pointed out to the Indonesian leadership that, contrary to what some
                            of them may believe, the United States very well understands the
                            dynamics and objectives of revolution, including that of Indonesia. <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0299"/>The American revolution has
                            continued and its present manifestation in which the equal rights of
                            citizens are being sought has even strengthened our understanding and
                            sympathy for such legitimate aspirations. We understand that to be
                            strong a nation must be given a sense of unity, self-identification, and
                            self-reliance.</p>
                        <p>4. We believe it natural that Indonesia should play an important role in
                            international affairs, I pointed out to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and I added that we could
                            see no reason why this should bring the United States and Indonesia into
                            opposition. I expressed the thought in this connection that Indonesia's
                            ability to exert external influence on events would be enhanced by
                            peaceful settlement of Indonesia's differences with its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>5. I told the Indonesians that since we share many basic objectives, we
                            should be able to live in mutual friendship and respect. This is the
                            desire of the United States and we hope also of Indonesia. However, it
                            is evident that our bilateral relations have been disturbed and allowed
                            to deteriorate because of our differing views on a broad range of other
                            issues in the world. The United States, I said, does not wish that these
                            other issues should control our relationship, but it seems to us that
                            the Indonesian Government has deliberately allowed this to happen.
                            Moreover, the campaign of anti-Americanism which has been taking place
                            in Indonesia in recent months seems designed to identify the United
                            States as the principal enemy of Indonesia. We understand that the
                            Indonesian Communist Party wishes to disrupt relations between the two
                            countries, but we do not assume that this also is the objective of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and other
                            Indonesian leaders. I told President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that I would like to be able to report to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> his estimate of
                            the direction and nature of Indonesian relations with the United States.
                            U.S. programs in Indonesia, such as <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and the Peace
                            Corps, I pointed out, had been designed to promote friendship and
                            understanding between us. However, since it appeared that they had
                            instead become irritants in our relations, we believe that they should
                            be removed unless the Indonesian Government wished them to remain and
                            would support them.</p>
                        <p>6. I told President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            that we considered him to be the leader of the Indonesian people and the
                            principal formulator of Indonesian policies. We believed the Indonesian
                            people would follow his guidance. Therefore, the nature of future United
                            States-Indonesian relations would be up to him. We should be prepared
                            for a constructive, friendly relationship.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> pushed
                            very hard to obtain United States support in their “confrontation” with
                            Malaysia, both constantly reiterating that what they termed as American
                            support of Malaysia could not but constitute a serious obstacle to the
                            improvement of relations between us. President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> described <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0300"/>the communique between President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName> and U.S. military
                            aid to Malaysia as evidence of United States support of Malaysia and
                            opposition to Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asserted that he regards Malaysia as a puppet of
                            “British imperialism” and had evidence it had been set up to “contain”
                            Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> sought to
                            obtain from me United States endorsement of his proposal that the
                            Malaysian issue be settled along the lines of the Manila agreement or
                            Tokyo declaration, and asserted that United States support in this
                            respect would permit the Indonesian Government to support and promote
                            improved bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the subject of Malaysia, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> also mentioned North Vietnam, North Korea, and
                            the Congo as examples matters of matters in which our differing
                            approaches have an effect on our bilateral relations. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> described to me his concept
                            of the Afro-Asian area as an “integrated political whole” and sought to
                            obtain from me agreement, which I did not give, that this concept is
                            accepted by the United States.</p>
                        <p>I spelled out for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, in
                            precise terms, our policy toward Malaysia and the nature of and reasons
                            for our commitment to South Vietnam, and the fact that we had no
                            territorial or other ambitions in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> clearly and
                            repeatedly inserted third country issues into our bilateral relationship
                            and gave every indication that Indonesia would continue to let the
                            relationship be dominated by such issues. I consistently declined to be
                            drawn into debate of the substance of these various other matters,
                            explaining that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            had asked me to come to Indonesia to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> the United
                            States-Indonesian bilateral relationship and reiterated that it seemed
                            to me this should not be influenced unduly by third country
                            relationships; that where our policies diverged we could at least agree
                            to disagree amicably. Apparently it became clear to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that I would not make a
                            substantive concession to his views regarding Malaysia, and he settled
                            for language in a communique that was much less than fully satisfactory
                            to him but nonetheless did permit him, as well as me, to conclude the
                            conversation gracefully.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asserted
                            that he also wished good relationships with the United States and he
                            requested that his views, as described above, be fully reported to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> acquiesced in the removal,
                            strongly recommended by First Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, Minister of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Army Chief of
                            Staff Yani in their remarks to me, of the Peace Corps from Indonesia. He
                            also, in the communique, publicly affirmed his desire that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-financed university contract teams be
                            continued. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made no
                            specific response to most of the points I had made to him concerning our
                            concept of and desire for friendly and constructive bilateral
                            relations.</p>
                        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0301"/>
                        <p>Other Indonesian officials with whom I talked, including most importantly
                            the Minister of Defense, General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, strongly advocated and advised that American
                            programs in Indonesia be removed for the time being. Arguments in
                            support of this advice pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party
                            is targeting its harassment tactics on these programs. Indonesian
                            officialdom, led by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            has taken an anti-American line publicly, and this makes it virtually
                            impossible for the military and police to support or even to protect
                            these programs adequately. Therefore, the programs would best be removed
                            because their security could not be assured, because they could not be
                            fully effective, and because they divert attention from the main aspects
                            of the sharpening internal power struggle between the communists and
                            non-communists. General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            predicted a one to two-year period of tense relations with the United
                            States resulting from this internal political struggle. He observed that
                            these political phenomena have their own momentum and direction, and
                            therefore are unlikely to be influenced by external pressures. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, principal leader
                            of the anti-communist military forces, in effect advised that the United
                            States prepare to keep its head down and patiently ride out a period of
                            political turbulence, and he said that he also wished the Indonesian
                            Army to follow this same course. A minority view, most prominently
                            expressed by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>, who was
                            recently promoted out of the Ministry of Trade, was that the United
                            States should avoid reducing its presence or its programs in Indonesia
                            on the grounds that removal of U.S. programs would encourage the
                            Indonesian communists and make them appear stronger than they actually
                            are.</p>
                        <p>Conversations with Indonesians generally followed this pattern of
                            conversation with President Sukarno and with General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>: Those of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> persuasion taking the
                            position that improvement in United States-Indonesian relations would be

                            while other elements, those traditionally more friendly to the United
                            States, advising that a period of disturbed relations lies ahead, that
                            the United States should lower its profile in order to remove targets
                            from communists' harassment, retain only those programs for which

                            support and protection could be obtained, and maintain a posture that
                            will permit a renewal of good relationships when conditions in Indonesia

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> is coming in
                            primarily to report to you on his mission to Indonesia. I attach at Tab
                            A the first two sections of a long report.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">
                                <ref target="#d121">See Document 121</ref>.</note> These sections
                            give his general conclusions and his recommendations.</p>
                        <p>2. He is pessimistic about the short-run prospects for improved U.S.
                            relations with Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>
                            knows it takes two to have good relations, and he thinks <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> simply does not want them
                            right now. Malaysia is the immediate cause of friction, but even if
                            Malaysia were settled, the internal politics of Indonesia would bend
                            Sukarno toward hostility to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>3. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>
                            believes strongly in a continued U.S. effort to play for the long-term
                            stakes by keeping open quiet lines of contact to the Indonesian
                            Government and people—and especially to the Indonesian military. He
                            recommends that we reduce our visibility, avoid punitive actions, remove
                            vulnerable Americans from isolated regions, but maintain a skeleton
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> staff with minor and popular
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects as our University
                            contract program. His one politically tricky recommendation is that we
                            should keep our good relations with the Indonesian military by
                            completing a firm but unfulfilled commitment to the Indonesian army to
                            help in finishing a telecommunications project (Part 2, page 2, item 2).
                            There is not yet an inter-agency position on this one.</p>
                        <p>4. There are two questions that may be more important than <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>'s report: (1) the succession in
                            Indonesia, and (2) your own possible interest in appointing <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(1) On Indonesia, <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> recommends
                            Henry Byroade who has done a very good job as Ambassador in Burma. The
                            State Department concurs, and so do we. Byroade's record is marred by
                            some private indiscretions, but he has apparently behaved very well in
                            Burma, and he has the temperament and style for Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>(2) On <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> himself, I continue
                            to think that if he were interested, he would give a stature and
                            coherence to our European Bureau that it has never had in many years,
                            even under Foy Kohler.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> has recently
                            reported to me on his mission to Indonesia. I have discussed with him
                            his experiences and impressions and have read with much interest his
                            report of his conversations with you and your advisers. I am deeply
                            appreciative of the time which you personally gave him and the
                            courtesies extended to him during his stay in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName>'s mission has
                            enabled us to obtain a fuller measure of understanding of your hopes and
                            concerns for Indonesia. <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0304"/>I hope
                            that it has correspondingly brought you a clearer view of American
                            policies and of our continuing desire for mutually friendly and
                            beneficial relations between the United States and Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>I hope, Mr. President, that we can keep in personal contact, and I shall
                            look forward to an opportunity when we can meet together for a closer
                            discussion of the broad areas of our mutual interests. Although there
                            are differences of view between us on some issues, I believe we should
                            not allow these differences to impair the relationships which have
                            existed between our governments and peoples over a number of years of
                            friendly association.</p>
                        <p>I am very grateful for the many years of dedicated service which
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> has given in the
                            cause of friendly relations between our nations. We all regret his
                            forthcoming retirement, but I have every confidence that we will be able
                            to continue under his successor the tradition of friendship and close
                            relations which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>
                            has fostered.</p>
                        <p>Only a few days ago I had the pleasure of welcoming Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> to Washington, and I trust, Mr.
                            President, that either through the channels of our respective
                            Ambassadors, or through this more direct means of personal
                            correspondence, we may narrow the gaps that threaten to separate our
                            countries and find and maintain a basis on which our peoples may
                            continue to live in true peace and friendship.</p>
                        <p>With all good wishes,</p>

                                made important strides in its campaign against remaining

                                suggested that the United States should prepare for the possibility
                                that Indonesia “could pass under institutionalized Communist control

                                would be a “maverick nationalist brand of communism which would be
                                Indonesia centered.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15

                            ChiComs and would undoubtedly have more appeal in Islam-impacted Middle
                            East than uncompromising brand of purely Communist-directed violent
                            revolution.</p>
                        <p>Despite this assessment, I believe it would be unwise for US to declare
                            that Indonesia is Communist or to begin overtly to treat Indonesia as a
                            Communist state. Should we do so the effect would most probably be to
                            rally in defense their country's honor and prestige those many who
                            presently give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            policies only lip service and half-hearted support. There is still some
                            chance for change or possibly even reversal of policies not yet
                            ineluctably solidified into Communist mold, and US posture should be one
                            that will enhance and strengthen if possible chances for future change
                            toward improved US-Indonesian relationship.</p>
                        <p>We believe guidelines set by Bunker report<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">
                                <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> are still correct but
                            that US should begin energetically though quietly to tool up for
                            effective <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0306"/>counter-propaganda
                            effort and other counter-actions against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies and Indonesia's current objective of
                            Nasakomizing Afro-Asian World.</p>
                        <p>For present we should not take lead in overtly declaring <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> pariah in our informational media since
                            this action would on one hand precipitate Indo reaction which would make
                            our maintenance of desired presence here virtually impossible and, on
                            other hand, would probably be premature in terms of credence to be given
                            by most AA nations we would hope to influence. Suggest therefore that
                            our public posture continue to be correct while avoiding being
                            identifiably hostile. We should probably express any cordiality required
                            to continue to play game with Sukarno in non-public channels. We should,
                            however, cease characterizing Indonesia as part of “free world,” since
                            in its international alignments it clearly is not, and term is ridiculed
                            by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> itself.</p>
                        <p>Specific actions recommended at this time are:</p>
                        <p>1. Make immediate and major effort to improve <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> signal strength and time devoted to broadcasting to
                            Indonesia. Indonesian people are currently almost completely cut off
                            from any interpretation, other than that dictated by Communist-dominated
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> propaganda machine, of facts
                            about national and international events. Most Western news magazines are
                            banned. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> signal poor.</p>
                        <p>2. Establish team composed of members located in this Embassy and in
                            Washington of political-editorial experts who can prepare material on
                            current basis for use by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and other
                            media for counter-propaganda effort with <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> world.</p>
                        <p>(A) It is hoped that promised info officer will be shortly assigned and
                            will be crack writer who can quickly put in usable form and transmit to
                            Washington material gathered here in conjunction with Embassy political
                            officer for channeling back to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>(B) Team in Washington should, besides screening and deciding on use of
                            this material, be concerned with broad appeal to Afro-Asian world and
                            techniques and actions required to counter ChiCom-Indonesian efforts
                            subvert other AA countries to their ideologies.</p>
                        <p>3. Major effect should be made to enlist active support for
                            counter-effort described above from friendly <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> nations and they, rather than US, should begin publicly
                            to expose Djakarta's aggressive and pro-Community policies.</p>
                        <p>4. Continue our efforts to inform AA moderates of true nature of Indo
                            approach to Algiers conference and importance of avoiding victory by
                            Indonesian-ChiCom coalition in name of unity or avoidance controversy.
                            We believe, for example, that greater emphasis on <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s own aggressive influence and policies
                            rather than on desirability Malaysian admission is indicated. Isolation
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> at Algiers almost certainly
                            lesser evil than Indonesian success.</p>
                        <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0307"/>
                        <p>5. Through third country radio broadcasts and such other means as can be
                            made available, including Embassy's own modest informational effort,
                            expose <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> efforts dominate political
                            spectrum in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>6. Through friendly <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> countries expose
                            throughout <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> world effect of Sukarno's
                            policies in Indonesia and acceleration of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence here.</p>
                        <p>7. Achieve foregoing in subdued manner which will avoid complete break
                            and removal remaining American presence in Indonesia. Obviously risks
                            would be involved in this respect in carrying out above recommendations
                            but risk must be taken in view danger current Indo policies aimed at
                            rest of <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> world.</p>
                        <p>Main thrust foregoing recommendations meant to be greater <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attention to and attempt cope with
                            problems raised by trends described reftel both in Indonesia and in
                            wider Afro-Asian context.</p>

                            of deserved thanks and to give Djakarta a signal of your confidence in
                            Green. The Indonesians, and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in particular, had a particularly high regard
                            for <persName>Jones</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our policy toward Indonesia is cool and correct at the
                            moment. We are keeping the door open to friendly relations, but we have

                        <p>To examine the domestic political situation and foreign policy trends in
                            Indonesia and Malaysia, and to estimate the prospects of both countries
                            and the probable course of their conflict with one another over the next
                            year or so.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. The principal development in Indonesia over the past year has been the
                            sharply accelerated growth of the Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) role <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0309"/>in government. This trend is likely to continue as long
                            as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is in control.
                            Opponents of this trend are discouraged and intimidated; even the
                            military has all but lost the will to resist. The longer <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> lives, the better will be
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> chances of maintaining or
                            improving its position following his death. (Paras. 2–11)</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s campaign to
                            destroy Malaysia, now in its third year, will almost certainly continue
                            at varying levels of intensity. There is little prospect of an
                            Indonesian military victory and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> knows it. This realization has led him to
                            denounce and harass the entire Western presence in Southeast Asia, and
                            indeed in the Afro-Asian world. (Paras. 14–16, 21)</p>
                        <p>C. We look for a continuation of Indonesia's hostile attitude toward the
                            US, though chances are less than even that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will go so far as to break
                            diplomatic relations. Ties with Communist China are likely to become
                            closer, since Sukarno sees no immediate Chinese threat to Indonesian
                            ambitions. The desire of the Indonesian military to continue receiving
                            Soviet arms aid will probably induce <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to maintain relatively friendly relations with
                            the USSR. (Paras. 17–23)</p>
                        <p>D. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dies or becomes
                            incapacitated in the next year or so, the immediate successor government
                            would probably be an ostensibly non-Communist coalition. The military
                            would almost certainly exercise greater authority than at present, but
                            would be unlikely to risk civil war to initiate a roll back of the
                            Communists. Indeed, the Communists are already so entrenched that they
                            could probably not be denied an important share in any successor
                            government. (Paras. 12–13)</p>
                        <p>E. In Malaysia, existing political and racial frictions will intensify,
                            but even if no settlement is achieved, we do not believe that this will
                            lead to a breakup of the federation during the period of this estimate.
                            The subversive threat to Malaysia is unlikely to bring down the present
                            regime unless it is significantly weakened by Indonesian actions on a
                            scale which we consider improbable. (Paras 24–33)</p>
                        <p>F. Malaysia is totally dependent on British military support and its
                            foreign policy is closely allied to that of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and its Commonwealth partners. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and to a lesser extent Australia and New
                            Zealand, have committed a considerable military force to the defense of
                            Malaysia. It will probably prove adequate to cope with likely Indonesian
                            actions and to deter <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            from substantially bolder aggression. Nevertheless, Malaysia will
                            continue to seek an even stronger US commitment to its defense. (Paras.
                            34–36)</p>

                            Indonesian Army people had come to us privately saying they needed some
                            secure means of internal communication within the army. Commercial

                        <p>Ambassador Dean said he had been instructed to convey to the Secretary
                            the British Government's unhappiness about the U.S. decision to permit
                            the sale of communications equipment for use by the Indonesian Army. The
                            Ambassador said he understood the U.S. problem but the British were
                            faced with the situation of trying to prevent other friendly countries
                            from supplying military equipment to the Indonesians. The French were
                            getting ready to sell three helicopters, using the action of the U.S. as
                            an excuse. The Dutch were about to sell twenty Fokkers. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was also having a lot of trouble with
                            the Japanese. The British had demonstrated that they practiced what they
                            preached when they cancelled the Decca contract some time ago.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> went over the
                            reasons for the U.S. decision which he had previously given to the
                            Ambassador. He stressed the limitations on the program and the
                            desirability of aiding the Indonesian Army to obtain a secure means of
                            internal communication.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that this sort of problem existed elsewhere.
                            We were not happy with some of the things the British were doing. For
                            instance, British shipping to Cuba. It was difficult to deal with each
                            one of these cases on an ad hoc basis. Perhaps we should discuss the
                            general problem in an attempt to arrive at a broad policy agreement. The
                            Secretary said we would be glad to talk with the British to see if a
                            basis could be found for a general agreement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Dean said he thought <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would
                            be interested in such talks. Perhaps Sir Burke Trend, Secretary of the
                            British Cabinet, could take up this matter on his current visit to the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>There was further discussion of our proposal to permit the sale of
                            communications equipment to the Indonesian Army. The Secretary <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0312"/>then mentioned that the
                            Pakistanis were apparently sending C–130 spare parts to Indonesia from
                            supplies originally furnished by the United States. We had taken this
                            matter up with Pakistan. In view of the nature of the problem, it would
                            probably be inadvisable for the British to make any approaches to the
                            Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Dean said that he had been unaware of this situation. He
                            agreed that it would probably not be a good idea for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to talk with the Pakistanis.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">In another meeting on August 2, also in <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s office, the Secretary told
                                Dean that “the British should probably wait to see what happens.
                                There is a good chance the Indonesians will not go through with the
                                purchase of the equipment.” (Memorandum of conversation, August 2;

                        <p>It appears that the conclusions reached by the <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> Mission, namely, that a large reduction in the
                            American presence in Indonesia would produce a better climate in which
                            to conduct US/Indonesian relations, are being proved fallacious and that
                            time may be running out on U.S. efforts to placate <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Perhaps our moderation in
                            dealing with Indonesia has misled <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to believe that the United States is not
                            prepared to defend its interests. There are nearly 100 million people in
                            Indonesia who by all logic and past history should be pro-American. I am
                            convinced they are truly afraid of Communist China but have the delusion
                            that they (Indos) are clever enough to handle them and/or are convinced
                            that the U.S. will back down and leave the Communist Chinese in a
                            commanding position.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it might be appropriate to consider what measures we should
                            take to make clear our determination to use the international waters
                            around the Indonesian islands and also to counteract the political
                            impact of the possible detonation of an atomic bomb in Indonesia. The
                            following steps might be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. Reopen with State the question of sending one or more Navy ships
                            through the Indonesian Straits “unannounced” to demonstrate our refusal
                            to accept the Indonesian claim to these as territorial waters.</p>
                        <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0314"/>
                        <p>2. Encourage the Atlantis II to carry out that part of its survey in the
                            Banda Sea which is clearly outside Indonesian territorial waters and
                            make it clear we will not stand for any harassment.</p>
                        <p>3. Reconsider our decision to permit Philco Corporation to build a
                            three-site communication system for the Indonesian Army. The Indonesians
                            apparently are delaying any decision in this matter in order to reap a
                            full political harvest from Malaysia's bitter reaction to the United
                            States support for its “enemy”. Although I supported the decision and
                            feel the opposition to this sale is largely emotional, I'm leaning
                            toward reneging now, not just because of Commonwealth opposition, but
                            because of continued <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            boorishness.</p>
                        <p>4. Take steps to minimize the political impact if Indonesia should
                            detonate an atomic bomb. Such a detonation is hardly possible without
                            ChiCom help but the Indos have surprised us before. The event would
                            alarm not only the Malaysians but the Fils, too.</p>

                        <p>We have learned of some disturbing views that are circulating on the
                            seventh floor at State regarding U.S. relations with Indonesia. We are
                            at a point where either an initiative by you at today's lunch or a talk

                        <p>It appears that the report of the attack on our Medan consulate coincided
                            with a contingency message from Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> discussing third-country representation of our
                            interests in the event of a break in relations with Indonesia—jointly to

                            high-level thrust toward quick and drastic action on the evacuation of

                            premature at this time. Both he and the experts regard August 17th as
                            the annual critical date. Actions taken by us prior to the 17th would
                            tend to be self-fulfilling.</p>
                        <p>Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> now has the

                        <p>264. 1. Following are my dominant first impressions of Indonesian
                            political scene. These impressions are shared by senior members of my
                            staff and are reflected in their excellent reports these past several
                            months.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">

                                promoting Communism</hi>'s cause in Indonesia. I concur in view
                            already expressed in this Embassy's reporting that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who clearly calls the
                            shots here, is attempting to move all forces in Indo society to left or,
                            more explicitly, to policy orientation similar to that PKI. This is
                            being done at as rapid a pace as seems prudent without creating
                            excessive dissidence or coalition of more conservative elements which
                            might conceivably act as coherent restraining influence. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not a “Communist” in a
                            formal sense, but he is certainly attracted to Communism as a means of
                            organizing society and advancing his own Marxist-nationalistic ideology.
                            We may look for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to
                            continue his efforts to develop a family of more or less “Communist”
                            power elements, of which the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> proper
                            would be an important but not an exclusive element. This (i) gives
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> more freedom to
                            operate, (ii) makes some sort of “communization a la Indonesia” more
                            palatable to other groups by allowing them to continue their existence
                            and even to prosper while being altered in their intrinsic content and
                            (iii) provides a more acceptable image abroad in areas of would-be
                            Indonesian or “<gloss target="#t_NEFO1">NEFO</gloss>” penetration.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Indonesia has become an almost completely closed
                                society</hi>. I was aware in Washington that we were taking a
                            propaganda beating but I was not aware of the extent of this anti-U.S.
                            campaign. Pro-Communist Antara News Agency is sole source of foreign
                            news. Indonesian people are receiving steady propaganda diet through
                            speeches of their leaders, press, radio and TV emphasizing seamy side of
                            U.S. domestic life and U.S. “imperialism and aggression” abroad. U.S.
                            efforts to refute hostile propaganda are largely ignored. While many
                            Indonesians say privately that they see merit in our side of story, they
                            are submerged in mass of anti-U.S. rhetoric and distorted news from
                            Antara or from Peiping, Pyongyang, Hanoi and Moscow. No one has the guts
                            to print objective views and this is understandable in Indonesia's
                            political environment.</p>
                        <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0317"/>
                        <p>a. Indonesians have developed art of smearing by insinuation to fine
                            point. Usual formula is to print distorted or manufactured allegation
                            against U.S. or other “imperialist” enemy, refuse to print rebuttal, and
                            then take stand that silence by “imperialists” implies consent. This
                            point clearly indicated by Minister Coordinator for Public Relations
                            Ruslan Abdulgani, who said in speech July 27 that absence of denial by
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Malaysia to Indo charges of
                            subversion in Sulawesi remind one of old Dutch saying that “those who
                            keep silent consent.”</p>
                        <p>4. U.S. officials in Indonesia are becoming increasingly isolated.
                            Indonesian contacts shy away from us when political climate heats up,
                            and this is the hot season in Djakarta. For our part we do not press to
                            see them since in present atmosphere this would put them in difficult
                            position. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, who has been here on and
                            off since 1949 and who, therefore, has many old Indonesian friends,
                            tells me that he leaves it up to these friends in most cases to see him,
                            wanting to avoid putting them on spot by seeking them out. In most cases
                            they stay away.</p>
                        <p>5. Although I see no immediate physical threat to Americans in Indonesia,
                            I believe there is virtue in further contraction of our establishment
                            here. I lean more and more in favor of withdrawing all university
                            contract Americans. Possibly it would be helpful to convey to Indos
                            impression that we are prepared to pull out completely if conditions
                            worsen appreciably. Perhaps if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> started really to think about it he would begin
                            to realize all the disadvantages and even dangers to him were a break in
                            relations to occur. This is not to deny that there would be
                            disadvantages to us as well, but I feel that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has come to feel over the
                            last several years that the U.S. has an infinite capacity to put up with
                            Indo harassments and humiliations. If we could shake this belief we
                            might at least buy time. In any case, previous U.S. posture of sweetness
                            and light has been anything but successful in recent past.</p>
                        <p>6. I have been unable to establish any kind of dialogue or even
                            antiphonal autologue with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in short time I have been here. Process has been
                            inhibited of course by events before my arrival, events following that
                            arrival and perhaps importantly by fact that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> goes into hibernation for
                            three weeks before his annual blockbuster speech on August 17. In fact
                            he raised latter subject with me as first topic in our conversation July
                            26. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has avoided
                            any talks with me. Other Indonesians are perfectly pleasant (for
                            example, my wife and I had long pleasant chat with Madame Hartini
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and several
                            cabinet ministers after opening of Book Fair yesterday) but social
                            dealings are as generally reflected in para 4 above.</p>
                        <p>7. Our style and approach towards Sukarno and company in past years may
                            have been appropriate under circumstances then but I believe time has
                            come to challenge old assumptions, to look at facts anew and to
                            re-examine our posture toward Indonesia. This is process we <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0318"/>must do in orderly deliberate manner.
                            We should avoid to extent circumstances permit any sudden changes of
                            policy or crash operations.</p>

                            physical threat to Americans. He recommends a further reduction of U.S.

                        <p>B. Our Embassy has been instructed to draw up a plan to reduce its staff

                            anti-American atmosphere, and to assess the utility versus the risk of

                        <p>On 24 July <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> stated that
                            Indonesia would build its own atomic bomb in the near future. He added
                            it would not be used for aggressive purposes. Last November General
                            Hartono, Director of the Army Arsenal said Indonesia planned to explode
                            a bomb in 1969. The same officer declared on 2 February 1965, that 200
                            scientists were working to produce bomb and promised a “surprise” at the
                            Armed Forces Day celebration in October 1965. A third statement by
                            Hartono made 27 July stated that there is a good possibility that
                            Indonesia will test an atomic bomb following the Afro-Asian conference
                            in Algiers this coming November.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0320"/>
                        <p>Indonesia does not have the capability to produce an atomic bomb without
                            outside assistance. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s behavior may be explained by the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. Just propaganda.</p>
                        <p>2. Forthcoming test of a Chinese bomb on Indonesian soil with Chinese
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>3. Forthcoming test of a Chinese bomb with “Indonesian ‘participation’”
                            and attendant publicity.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may denounce the
                            test ban and withdraw from it. </p>
                        <p>If 1. above is the case and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is making a strictly propaganda pitch (our
                            Embassy in Djakarta suspects this), then no comment on the part of the
                            United States is required.</p>
                        <p>Regarding 2., a test in Indonesia, our Embassy remains doubtful that a
                            detonation will take place. Yet the Embassy allows that if the
                            detonation is to be made almost purely for political purposes and if
                            auxiliary scientific expertise needed to collect technical research data
                            is held to a minimum or dispensed with entirely, it is conceivable that
                            a ChiCom-Indonesian collaboration could successfully meet the deadline.
                            Reporting for the ChiCom side, our Consul General in Hong Kong believes
                            the ChiComs would recoil in horror from conducting a test in Indonesia,
                            mainly on security grounds. AmConGen Hong Kong notes that the ChiCom
                            hypersensitivity on maintaining security with respect to conventional
                            military developments is notorious and without question would be even
                            greater with respect to nuclear weapons. AmConGen Hong Kong doubts that
                            the ChiComs would expect that their role could be kept secret. If it
                            became known this would defeat Sukarno's presumed purpose, i.e. that it
                            was solely an Indonesian nuclear breakthrough.</p>
                        <p>We can not doubt that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            would like to detonate a bomb in Indonesia. He would believe that it
                            would enhance his prestige among the Afro-Asians and it would, quite
                            frankly, shock the British and their Malaysian allies, along with
                            Australia. It would add tremendous drive to Indonesia's plan to set up
                            the Conference of Newly Emerging Forces (<gloss target="#t_CONEFO1">CONEFO</gloss>) as a rival and eventual successor to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The problem is not whether Indonesia
                            would detonate a bomb if they could but whether the ChiComs will help
                            them. We don't think they will. Nevertheless we have requested DIA to
                            intensify their efforts in watching for indications of a preparation of
                            an Indonesian testing site and association of Indonesians with the
                            ChiCom test program.</p>
                        <p>If it is indicated that the ChiComs and Indonesians are preparing for a
                            detonation then we should</p>
                        <p>a) Coordinate early with the British on intelligence.</p>
                        <p>b) Prepare a pre-emptive statement which would take much of the wind out
                            of the Indonesian sails. </p>
                        <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>Regarding 3., a test of a ChiCom bomb in China, with “Indonesian
                            participation,”—we give this a better chance of being carried out than
                            we do a detonation in Indonesia but we are doubtful it will be done.
                            Besides the problem of security, there is the question of whether or not
                            Peiping really wants another Asian state to claim the status of being a
                            nuclear power. AmConGen Hong Kong believes that Peiping is trying to
                            reduce Asian, and especially Japanese, criticism of its nuclear program
                            and wonders if ChiCom nationalistic and chauvinistic pride might not
                            cause them to take a dim view of an additional Asian country attempts to
                            climb on the nuclear bandwagon. We don't think Peiping wants Indonesia
                            alongside—at least for the present. However, we have asked DIA carefully
                            watch for any Indonesian participation in the ChiCom test program.</p>
                        <p>If there is an indication of this, we should prepare a pre-emptive
                            statement which would denounce the Indo-ChiCom collaborative effort.</p>
                        <p>The final case is that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            may denounce the test ban treaty and withdraw from it. There is a good
                            chance that this might happen. State believes that recent Indonesian
                            pronouncements regarding atomic bombs point toward the possibility that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might regard a
                            denunciation of the test ban treaty as valid and dramatic material for
                            use in his 17 August Independence Day speech. State particularly notes
                            Foreign Minister Subandrio's recent statement to the effect that the
                            only real way of removing the threat of nuclear war is for all nations
                            to have their own stocks of nuclear weapons. We recommend:</p>

                            speech. In addition to possibility of a test ban denunciation, it may
                            indicate more about a future detonation.</p>
                        <p>b) Prepare a contingent statement in case Indonesia withdraws from the

                                is enough of a possibility that Indonesians may acquire an atomic
                                device and explode it for psychological reasons to warrant an
                                investigation by the intelligence community and to prepare a public
                                position.” <persName corresp="#p_HEK1">Hamilton</persName> suggested
                                consulting the Department of State. (Ibid.) On September 22 Barber
                                wrote Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International
                                Organization Affairs Joseph J. Sisco a letter stating that “there
                                was a very real possibility that an atomic bomb will be set off in
                                Indonesia in October, with Chinese assistance.” Barber hoped that
                                the United Nations could pass a strongly worded resolution
                                condemning any such test. (Ibid.)</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>The subject of Indonesia came up briefly at the breakfast meeting this
                            morning attended by the above persons. The Senators were interested in
                            what <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had said in his
                            August 7 [17] Independence Anniversary speech. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that the US rather than
                            Britain and Australia had been singled out for attack although perhaps
                            the attack was less violent than one might have expected. The speech
                            clearly aligned <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            Indonesia with the Communist World in terms of objectives and
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>There was then an inconclusive discussion about the role of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and the army in Indonesia, during which
                            the Under Secretary indicated that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s activities had considerably aided the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s penetration of the government. One of
                            the Senators said that he understood the army would oppose the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. The Under Secretary commented that the
                            situation would not arise as long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was at the helm. Should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> disappear, and there were
                            rumors that he had been quite ill recently, it was not clear and
                            predictable whether the army would go all out against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> or whether the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> processes of infiltration of the government had reached
                            that point where the army would try to accommodate itself with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in some form of modus vivendi.
                            Much might depend on the kind of action the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> initiated should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> disappear and this is unpredictable at this
                            juncture.</p>

                        <p>403. 1. Following is my assessment of where we stand following <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s August 17 attack on
                            US.</p>
                        <p>2. There are widely differing interpretations of speech and its
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>A. Many, who emphasize what <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might have said or done, consider speech “mild.”
                            Australians, British and Indians here hold view, but my Australian
                            colleague (Shann) showed me his report to Canberra which ends on note
                            that despite “mildness” of speech he “does not take much comfort from
                            it.”</p>
                        <p>B. Others view speech as further tightening of inexorable process by
                            which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, singlehandedly
                            but with support <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and others,
                            subverts that large, unknowing and basically unwilling part of Indo
                            people and induces them to accept a Communist-oriented state and
                            severance of ties with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Subgroup of
                            Indos who share this general view realizes what <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is attempting to do but
                            prefers ignore or downplay his effectiveness in belief they can achieve
                            their own narrow objectives (usually profit) and live until pendulum
                            swings back from extreme left. Latter group includes some of Indo army
                            and many private entrepreneurs.</p>
                        <p>3. Future events will show which of foregoing closest to truth. We can
                            take some satisfaction from fact <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not attack President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> or mention <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. However US was only nation singled out
                            for strong attack and I believe we should get across the idea that we
                            are anything but happy about speech and that there are limits to what
                            any nation can take in terms of abuse, damage to property, etc.</p>
                        <p>4. Process of implementing Aug 17 address will probably be one in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s ministers and
                            others will attempt sense what speech means by offering to Sukarno for
                            approval those actions they believe he wants. Significant so far in this
                            respect is campaign to have US Consul Surabaya declared personna non
                            grata (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 365).<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">Dated August 8. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 17 US–INDON)</note> Press charges August 21 that
                            American missionaries implicated in recent civil unrest in West Irian
                            may be another example.</p>
                        <p>5. We interpret August 17 speech to mean that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is in for continued difficulty in trying to do normal
                            business in Indonesia. We <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0324"/>believe <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> again gave
                            clear signal that he will keep heat on US unless and until we change our
                            policies toward Malaysia, Vietnam and elsewhere to conform to his
                            wishes. If not, he threatens action against US business interests and
                            has, in effect, given green light for further “expressions of peoples'
                            will” against official US installations.</p>
                        <p>6. By same token we believe speech indicates <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> not now ready for break
                            with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Relating future of American
                            business enterprises to Malaysia rather than to Vietnam may mean he
                            still hopes get some mileage from US on Malaysia now that Singapore has
                            withdrawn. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            implied as much during my call August 12 (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 318).<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">Dated August 13.
                                (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> INDON–US)</note> We may
                            as result have some slack, but probably not much.</p>
                        <p>7. August 17 speech and other recent events also indicate we probably
                            cannot have much direct impact on Indonesia's policymaking through
                            normal diplomatic exchange as long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is in control. As a result of his own complexes,
                            Marxist political views and suspicions arising from 1958 events and
                            later, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has clearly
                            identified US as enemy. No Indonesians influential in governing
                            processes are likely to stand up to him even if he should push relations
                            with US to breaking point. We also cannot realistically expect to have
                            decisive influence on other power groups, such as mil although it
                            important we maintain contact with them.</p>
                        <p>8. Although prospects for short run gloomy, there is very useful role for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to play in Indonesia. Following
                            are among things we can and should do as long as we can stay here with
                            dignity:</p>
                        <p>A. Maintain whatever contact possible with military and other elements in
                            power structure, looking toward post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> period.</p>
                        <p>B. Maintain basic diplomatic and hopefully consular presence here, again
                            looking toward time when we may be able operate more effectively.</p>
                        <p>C. Continue do useful political, economic and especially intelligence
                            reporting. While Washington best judge, we believe it important maintain
                            full flow reporting to build basic background in event diplomatic
                            relations broken and also fill gaps created by Indonesia's drastic
                            reduction in contacts with free world.</p>
                        <p>D. Identify Indonesia maneuvers and aspirations to Afro-Asian and Latin
                            American countries and, either directly or through third countries,
                            subject these to cold light of publicity.</p>
                        <p>E. Attempt to get some objective news reporting info Indonesia through
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, Embassy news bulletins, and
                            other means. Effect these efforts likely to be limited, but Indonesians

                                post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> period, I
                            will attempt establish dialogue with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> but I hesitate to reach any conclusions right

                            prepared to continue this kind of relationship, or if he is, how
                            productive such a line of effort would be. Experience over past year
                            suggests it has definite limitations.</p>
                        <p>9. As I see it, we need, by trial and error, to find correct balance of
                            carrot and stick. Petulance or overreaction by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would probably drive <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to extremes. Under reaction on our part makes us
                            look foolish to our friends abroad and to some Indonesians. I believe we
                            struck about right balance in August 17 celebration. I attended speech,
                            palace reception, film show on Indonesia's accomplishments, and opening
                            of development exhibition but stayed away from cultural evening (North
                            Vietnamese performed) and parade. Sending modified Presidential message
                            of congratulations on 20th anniversary was just about right.</p>
                        <p>10. It difficult now to come up with precise recommendations on size and
                            nature of our mission here. While Dept and Embassy seem to be fully
                            agreed on reduction of mission along lines of para (a) of <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 302,<note n="5" xml:id="d135fn5">Dated August 12. (Ibid., PER 4–1 DJAKARTA)</note> how far we should
                            go with regard to (b) and re other issues will become more apparent in
                            coming weeks. Indocom is one sensitive problem which could affect our
                            relations in short run. University contracts are another and I am
                            pleased with Dept's approach para 2 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 196.<note n="6" xml:id="d135fn6">Dated August 20.
                                (Ibid., EDX–31 INDON)</note> Since we cannot overload the line, I
                            would prefer delay final decision on future university contracts at
                            least until Philco issue decided. For the present I can only urge that
                            we maintain flexibility in order to be in best position cope with
                            situation. I have asked our Consuls in Medan and Surabaya to come to
                            Djakarta for discussions later this week. Following these discussions
                            and probable further developments by Indos we will be in better position
                            make firm recommendations.</p>

                            late August 1965 “an impromptu meeting of about a half-dozen officials
                            in his office.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked wasn't
                            it true that in terms of size and importance “Indonesia was objectively
                            at least on a par with the whole of Indochina?” The consensus of the
                            meeting was that it was. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            then asked was not “a far-left, if not a totally communist, takeover

                            effects on the position of the non-communist countries of Southeast
                            Asia?” <persName>Bundy</persName> recalls that the consensus held that
                            the scenario described by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            was inevitable. Then <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked
                            was there something that could be done to slow or counter this trend.
                            The consensus was, “there was not a single friendly element or favorable
                            factor that could be effective, even if it were wise to seek to
                            galvanize it.” In discussing Indonesia at an historical conference at
                            Annapolis in 1995, <persName>Bundy</persName> also recalled that Ball
                            asked the Central Intelligence Agency's representative if the Agency
                            could use its assets to reverse this trend in Indonesia.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> recalled that the representative replied
                            the Agency did not have good assets in Indonesia and was unable to make
                            much of an impact.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is the unchallenged
                            leader of Indonesia and will almost certainly remain so until death or
                            infirmity removes him from the scene. He is developing in Indonesia an
                            authoritarian government of the “national-front” type on which the
                            Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) exerts
                            the strongest influence, though under his own continued domination. The
                            past year or two have been characterized by rapid progress toward this
                            objective. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> now claims 3,000,000
                            members and is by far the best organized and most dynamic political
                            entity in Indonesia. With <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s support, the Communists and their sympathizers
                            have come to occupy a major position in the central government and in
                            numerous provincial and local administrations. Whatever its present
                            influence on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, it is
                            clear that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> finds <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies, both domestic
                            and foreign, compatible with its own interests. It does not create these
                            policies, but provides specific suggestions on method and timing which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> finds acceptable.
                            His own predilections, skillfully played upon by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, have brought his foreign policy into
                            close harmony with that of the Communist states of Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. Communist fortunes in Indonesia will probably continue to prosper so
                            long as Sukarno stays in power. As in the past, however, he will
                            probably move cautiously in expanding <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> participation in the government so as to avoid creating
                            excessive domestic unrest or encouraging a coalition of non-Communist
                            elements. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> lives,
                            it is probable that in two or three years the Indonesian state will be
                                <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0328"/>sufficiently controlled by
                            the Communists to be termed a Communist state, even though <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains the acknowledged
                            leader. It will probably not be possible, however, to detect any precise
                            moment at which the Communists “take over,” unless <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> chooses to proclaim it. We
                            believe that domestic political considerations and his desire to
                            bequeath his personal political concepts to Indonesia will lead him to
                            refrain from such an announcement. Conceivably, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders could become powerful enough to
                            threaten <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s own
                            dominance, but since his policies are likely to remain along lines
                            generally favorable to them, they are unlikely to take risks in order to
                            seize power.</p>
                        <p>3. In the event of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            early death or incapacity, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> drive
                            to power would probably be slowed for a time. Though there would be
                            considerable political turmoil and perhaps some violence, the successor
                            government would probably be headed at first by a coalition of familiar
                            non-Communist military and civilian names. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> could probably not be denied an important share in this
                            government, both because of its established position and because the
                            military would probably be reluctant to risk civil war to initiate a
                            roll back of the Communists. On the other hand, the party would no
                            longer benefit from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            patronage and would have to rely entirely on its own strengths and
                            capabilities, which though considerable would probably be insufficient
                            to encourage an open challenge to the military. Hence, we believe that
                            the PKI would not attempt to seize full power by force in the months
                            following Sukarno's death if that occurred at any early date.</p>
                        <p>4. The longer <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> lives,
                            the better will be the position of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> after his death. Another two or three years of his rule
                            are likely to weaken anti-Communist elements in the army and elsewhere
                            to the point where, at his death, the Communists would have a good
                            chance of taking over full power. We do not exclude other possibilities,
                            however, such as the emergence of a coalition of anti-Communists leading
                            to a protracted stalemate or to a conflict which could break up the
                            Indonesian state.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Implications </p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s Indonesia already
                            acts in important respects like a Communist state and is more openly
                            hostile to the US than most Communist nations. Much of the damage that
                            an avowedly Communist Indonesia could do to the Western position in the
                            Far East is being done (e.g., “confrontation” of Malaysia and subversion
                            and infiltration in the Philippines) and neither <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> nor any probable successor
                            government is likely to abandon efforts to weaken the West in this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>6. Nevertheless, the overt accession to communism of a country like
                            Indonesia—large, populous, rich in resources, and strategically <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0329"/>situated—would have an
                            important impact on other countries in South and East Asia. Peking would
                            be especially gratified by the triumph of one of its closest associates
                            and, for a time, would probably offer close cooperation in the Malaysian
                            area. Both Peking and Hanoi would be encouraged in their struggle with
                            the US in Vietnam, while the confidence of Laos, Thailand, and South
                            Vietnam would be undermined. The advent of a Communist state on the
                            Indian Ocean would make India increasingly nervous.</p>
                        <p>7. Given Indonesia's limited military capability and its many strategic
                            vulnerabilities, a Communist Indonesia would pose only a potential
                            threat to the Western position in Southeast Asia and to important world
                            sea and air lanes. The threat of a Communist Indonesia would be felt
                            most immediately in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Australia, and would
                            lead their governments to make urgent demands for substantial US and
                            Commonwealth military support.</p>
                        <p>8. The conservative Malaysian government would despair of a satisfactory
                            settlement of its dispute with Djakarta. Furthermore, it would expect
                            intensification of Indonesian efforts to subvert the peninsular Malays,
                            and increased cooperation between Djakarta and Peking in arming and
                            training dissidents on the Thai-Malayan border and in northern Borneo.
                            Singapore would face an intensified effort to subvert its Chinese
                            population. Both governments would face increased pressure by all
                            left-wing political and labor groups. The Commonwealth presence would
                            probably make it possible for moderate governments in the two states to
                            survive for the period of this estimate, but over a longer period the
                            existence of a Communist Indonesia would cause their chances of survival
                            to diminish.</p>
                        <p>9. The Philippine Government, already concerned about Indonesian
                            infiltration of the southern islands as well as Djakarta's clandestine
                            political activities in Manila itself, would show real alarm. Irritants
                            in its relations with the US would probably be submerged for a time in a
                            sense of common danger. The Australians would fear for East New Guinea
                            and their lines of communication to Europe and the Far East.</p>
                        <p>10. As a major Communist state led by a markedly independent and
                            self-reliant party, Indonesia would become the object of more intense
                            Sino-Soviet rivalry. Moscow would probably increase its military and
                            economic assistance in hopes of encouraging the development of a second
                            Asian Communist power center to compete with Peking. For its part, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would probably take a friendlier
                            attitude toward Moscow in the interest of material gain. Peking would,
                            of course, increase its efforts to tie Djakarta even more closely to
                            Chinese policy in the Far East. But it is likely that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> foreign policy decisions, like those of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, would stress
                            Indonesian national interests above those of Peking, Moscow, or
                            international communism in general. The <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0330"/>pursuit of these national interests would be more
                            likely to lead to friction with the Chinese Communists than with the
                            Soviets. Thus, Indonesia's formal accession to communism, while
                            immediately strengthening the Communist side, would contribute over the
                            longer run to transforming the Communist world into a looser association
                            of sovereign states.</p>
                        <p>11. A Communist Indonesia would probably not become of major military
                            significance to either Moscow or Peking during the period of this
                            estimate. An Indonesia openly led by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> might ask for security guarantees from Moscow and
                            Peking, and such requests might, in the circumstances, be difficult to
                            reject. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders
                            would be sufficiently nationalistic to refuse to grant air or naval
                            bases or missile sites to either Moscow or Peking, though it is possible
                            that they would permit one or both to use existing Indonesian bases for
                            logistical purposes, thereby greatly extending the range, for example,
                            of their submarines. In any bargaining with Moscow or Peking on the
                            subject of bases or missile sites, the Indonesians would undoubtedly be
                            favorably impressed by offers of nuclear weapons in exchange. It is
                            extremely doubtful, however, that Moscow would make such an offer, and,
                            over the next two or three years, unlikely that Peking would be in a
                            position to do so.</p>
                        <p>12. In the short term, Indonesia's formal accession to communism would
                            have a heavy impact on world politics. It would be seen as a major
                            change in the international balance of political forces and would inject
                            new life into the thesis that communism is the wave of the future. But
                            while Communists around the world would be encouraged, and their
                            opponents disturbed, this event would not by itself cause other nations
                            to follow suit or even necessarily to alter their foreign policies.</p>
                        <p>13. The longer term impact of a Communist Indonesia would depend
                            primarily on the degree of success or failure which the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> met as it moved to energize and unite
                            the Indonesian nation. If these efforts succeeded, Indonesia would
                            provide a powerful example for the underdeveloped world and hence a
                            credit to communism and a setback for Western prestige. It is much more
                            likely that the early years of a Communist Indonesia would be occupied
                            with consolidating political control and resuscitating the Indonesian
                            economy and that, during this period, Indonesia would be more liability
                            than asset to the Communist powers.</p>

                        <p>486. 1. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was friendly
                            and relaxed throughout my forty-five minute call at his office Aug. 31.
                            Most of our conversation was small talk and story telling, but was not
                            without its serious moments and verbal fencing. I doubt that anything
                            was accomplished beyond establishing some rapport with the man who
                            controls the destiny of this country. At no point did he raise old
                            favorites like Malaysia, Vietnam, Congo, etc. He was on his good
                            behavior. No others present.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> inquired whether I
                            really understood nationalism in Asia and sentiments of Asian people. I
                            assured him I did, that nationalism is a force we respect in developing
                            national consciousness and unity, that we fully support Indonesia's
                            territorial integrity and welcome its economic advancements and
                            self-reliance, that I nevertheless recognize that I have much to study
                            and learn about Indonesia just as any Indonesian would wish to study and
                            learn more about the United States. For this reason I felt strongly
                            about the need for close dialogue, student exchanges, free circulation
                            of information about each other's countries, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> then spoke of basic
                            principles behind Indonesia's revolutions and reminded me of Sun
                            Yat-sen's dictum to effect that it is easy to speak and to act in regard
                            to another nation but it is most difficult to understand it. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> then inquired whether we
                            really understood the forces of revolution and change in this part of
                            the world. I said I thought we did although, here again, America and
                            Indonesia still had much to learn about each other. We too are a country
                            in revolution—not just technically and scientifically, but politically
                            as well, as witness way Pres <persName>Johnson</persName> facing boldly
                            up to problem of promoting complete racial equality and improvement of
                            lot of negroes.</p>
                        <p>4. In expressing hope that ways could be found for improving Indo-US
                            relations, I mentioned that a major obstacle was Indonesian actions
                            against American properties and our concern over safety of our people (I
                            alluded to missionaries in this regard). <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> replied that popular feeling against the United
                            States, including demonstrations, was bound to continue as long as
                            American newspapers and magazines printed defamatory articles about
                            Indonesia and its leaders. This led to discussion along lines so
                            familiar to my predecessor. I <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0332"/>pointed out that Indo actions as well as statements against US
                            engendered a lot of anger back home. At same time I recalled no instance
                            where our President or anyone in high authority had shown anything but
                            restraint and understanding in their statements about Indonesia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> seemed to brush
                            this aside. He displayed genuine concern about critical articles
                            regarding him and Indonesia appearing in American publications,
                            specifically mentioning Time, Life, Newsweek (probably because they have
                            wide circulation in Afro-Asian countries), and he asked me several times
                            whether something could be done to halt these injurious representations
                            of Indonesia to the world. He cited Time article about Queen of Cambodia
                            as prime example of bad American journalism. I replied that this article
                            was mild compared to what Prince Sihanouk had said over Khmer radio
                            about President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> shortly
                            after his death. I quoted those infamous words. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was visibly shocked but he
                            merely said with feeling: <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            was a great man.</p>
                        <p>5. Conversation was interlarded with many stories and lighter touches. In
                            conclusion, I expressed hope we could keep in close touch and that I
                            knew he preferred informality which I did too. As we walked to door,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and I agreed that
                            we would only tell the press that this was a courtesy call in course of
                            which we had a general discussion. This he relayed in both Indonesian
                            and English to the considerable group of newsmen and photographers
                            outside. (Morning Indonesian press quotes Sukarno along these lines.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> escorted me to
                            car and cordially waved goodbye in full view of those present. I smiled
                            too, but vaguely wondered when the next low blow would come.</p>

                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> to protest
                                demonstrations against U.S. Consulates and to “make it painfully
                                clear to him that any serious attacks against our properties or
                                persons will force the US to take important decisions re its
                                relations with Indonesia.” <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recommended that <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> imply that the United States might close its
                                consulates, or even the Embassy, and require Indonesia to do the
                                same. (Ibid.)</note> has concluded that what we faced with is
                            culmination concerted campaign by <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            and probably others to bring about closing of our consulates, with
                            collusion or tacit approval by Central Govt. We recognize possibility
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> motivation may be complicated
                            by desire use pressure on consulates as weapon against us, that it may
                            find role of consulates as “whipping boy” useful to head off internal
                            confrontation, and that it may lack ability control extremist actions in
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p>2. We suspect GOI attitude may be composite of foregoing, but regardless
                            of motivation <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has created situation
                            which is making our position untenable, and we do not see significant
                            chance for improvement. We believe any further deterioration will
                            introduce serious danger to personal safety of Americans in provinces,
                            though perhaps not in Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>3. With this in mind, we believe time has come to demand explicit and
                            effective guarantee from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of security
                            American persons and property in Indonesia from both mob action and
                            harassment by either public or private Indo groups or people. Failing
                            receipt of such guarantee in credible form in very near future, we
                            intend close Surabaya Consulate. Without specifying Surabaya Secretary
                            will make this position clear to <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> today, noting that if we find such action
                            necessary we will have to look into question of continuation of Indo
                            presence here in its present form. Our current thought is that, if Indos
                            do not follow through, we would close Surabaya late next week. Report

                        <p>4. We fully aware value of Surabaya as listening post and that consular
                            district contains number of American citizens, but feel we are too close
                            to end of line to let these considerations outweigh need for action on
                            our part. We also feel that if Indos fail to act and we close Surabaya,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will be faced with decision to
                            protect Medan or face seeing it go too. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> really wants both consulates shut (at clearly implied
                            price their consulates here) they will produce this result themselves at
                            time their choosing with maximum damage to us. If they do not want both
                            closed, vigorous action re Surabaya may bring about more cautious action
                            re Embassy and Medan. We also recognize chance that Indos will interpret
                            closing as hostile gesture, but believe we must take this chance.</p>

                            think necessary, similar action with Medan at this point. At political

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Secretary told Ambassador Palar that he had asked him to come in
                            regarding the serious problem of Indonesia not affording the <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0335"/>most elementary rights of legation to
                            diplomatic and consular establishments.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary said that the United States was becoming increasingly
                            concerned about the repeated intrusions in Indonesia on the rights of
                            legation, which have been recognized for many years as fundamental to
                            the elementary proprieties of international conduct. We afford these
                            rights to Indonesian representatives in the United States, and we expect
                            them to be afforded our representatives in Indonesia. The United States
                            must know more clearly what the intentions of the Indonesian Government
                            are. We find the present situation intolerable. If the Government of
                            Indonesia really wants a continuation of diplomatic relations, it must
                            afford adequate protection to our personnel and our installations.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary emphasized that he was not discussing any of the foreign
                            policy issues about which Indonesia and the United States have different
                            opinions. Rather, he was referring to the structure of diplomacy by
                            which foreign relations are carried out. The most basic requirement of
                            this structure is that diplomatic representatives be protected and
                            allowed to conduct their business without harassment. The Indonesian
                            Government is not providing this protection.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> said he
                            regretted the attacks on our establishments which had taken place. He
                            attempted to explain them by saying that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> allows demonstrations so that he may respond to
                            the wishes of the people, and that unfortunately sometimes the
                            demonstrations get out of hand, particularly outside of Djakarta.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s strength, he
                            said, is that he never goes beyond what he knows the people of Indonesia
                            want.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary responded that the United States does not underestimate
                            the leadership qualities of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, which have been manifested in many ways. In
                            this matter, however, we have not heard him tell the Indonesian people
                            to respect the right of legation. What we have heard him say would tend
                            to encourage demonstrations, not restrain them. We do not believe that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is helpless
                            in the face of public opinion. Our impression is that he is the leader
                            of Indonesia, who shapes and molds public opinion in his country.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary emphasized that it is of the utmost importance that the
                            highest level of the Indonesian Government understands that if Indonesia
                            wants relations with the United States, it must correct the situation
                            which has developed and which has now become dangerous. If the
                            Indonesian Government allows mass demonstrations to continue to the
                            point where we can no longer operate and where the safety of our people
                            is involved, we shall have to examine the position of Indonesian
                            installations in the United States. Before departing, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> said that he was
                            embarrassed by what is happening in <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0336"/>Indonesia and that he had no excuse for it. He would
                            convey the Secretary's request to his Government immediately.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">According to telegram 329 to Djakarta, September
                                17, <persName corresp="#p_PLN1">Palar</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> on that day to “reaffirm <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> intention honor rights of
                                legation.” Palar stated that the Indonesian Government would allow
                                and, on occasion encourage, demonstrations, but it had issued strict
                                orders to the police to prevent violence. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–8 INDON)</note>

                            consulates (and eventually out of the country altogether). An Indo-U.S.

                                State was under considerable pressure to reduce official
                                representation in Indonesia to a minimum, and “the prospects for
                                continued diplomatic relations with Indonesia become dimmer every

                                the Department transmitted a memorandum, originally prepared by

                                United Nations. The memorandum noted that the 30th of September
                                Movement had installed a 40-man Revolutionary Council led by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> who had a

                            unnamed generals and politicians have been arrested, and the homes of
                            Defense Minister General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Army Commander General Yani are under

                        <p>A decree issued on 1 October by <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Lt. Colonel
                                Untung</persName>, Commander of the Presidential Bodyguard, stated
                            that the government would be administered by an Indonesian Revolution
                            Council. According to the decree, the council will follow already
                            established government policies, and council membership will be
                            announced shortly.</p>
                        <p>No mention has been made of any active role by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The government radio
                            initially announced that the 30 September Movement was organized to
                            “save President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> whose
                            health was in danger.” It later commented that he was safe and
                            “continues to carry out the leadership of the state.”</p>
                        <p>The 30 September group claims that the alleged Generals' plot was
                            American inspired. The US Embassy's external telephone line was cut
                            three hours before the Indonesian Radio announced that the “coup” had
                            been thwarted. Troops are stationed at the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>The immediate purpose of the 30 September Movement appears to be the
                            elimination of any political role by anti-communist Army elements and a
                            change in Army leadership. Action against similar Army elements
                            apparently is also planned outside Djakarta. The affair may also be used
                            to generate new Anti-American activity.</p>
                        <p>It seems likely that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            knew in advance of the movement and its intention. Prime movers in the
                            whole affair, however, in terms of timing and detailed planning may well
                            have been First Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and Communist Leaders who are close to him and

                            may be the first step toward a Communist takeover. They have pushed the
                            young officers out in front. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            headquarters seem to be going ahead without any strain and the people we

                            do not know. The people on the list are not terribly reassuring.

                            and perhaps we should talk to the British and the Australians about

                            coup would appear to have been from the leftist side. It was by group of
                            young officers but most of the council they set up are pretty far on the
                            left and there is very big question as to how much <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> were instrumental in this or at least
                            aware of it. There was a lot of activity in <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_hq1">Hq</gloss> which remained open. We have had in
                            past three hours report that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> had gotten hold of other army elements and
                            taken back Djakarta radio station and rescued <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and to what extent he has
                            been able to get control of the situation is not known. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said if it would be useful to
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> he could send
                            someone up to give him drill. <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> said Lausche and some others wanted to have a
                            meeting but he had gotten a report that there was not enough information
                            to warrant it. <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> said in
                            view of circumstances he did not think it would do much good. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it is very hard to know just
                            what the situation is—they simply say <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is fine and that they had rescued him. The other
                            side said <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was in good
                            health. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he has feeling
                            if <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> takes over he may
                            keep going and clean up <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>—this is the
                            most optimistic expectation <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0341"/>but
                            it is unclear at the moment. <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> again said in view of tentative nature of it
                            it would be waste of time for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to send someone over until Monday.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">October 4.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was best bet and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he is about the best bet but
                            that the army's antipathy to <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is not
                            based on ideology—but the army may not be in a cushy spot—it is [an]
                            ignoble motive. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> agreed they could
                            not depend on any Indonesians.</p>

                        <p>Secretary wanted to know if there was anything special this morning on
                            Indonesian situation. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            mentioned the telcon during the night,<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">In
                                this teleconference, October 2, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked the Embassy four questions: what was the
                                current situation, who was in ascendancy, what was <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s status and if
                                unknown, what was the Embassy's estimate, and what was the situation
                                with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>? The Embassy responded
                                that Djakarta was relatively quiet with forces loyal to <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> no longer a major military
                                threat. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was in
                                ascendancy, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                                status was unknown, but he was not supporting the Army. He was in

                                for the dust to settle, or he masterminded the whole affair to
                                discredit the Army (highly unlikely). <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was not active but still prepared and able to

                        <p>The situation in Indonesia is in an uneasy calm, and President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> seems to be making great
                            efforts to bring about national unity in the face of growing antagonism
                            between the Army and the groups that supported the 30 September
                            Movement. The bodies of the senior military officers who were shot early
                            in the 30 September attempted coup have been discovered. There is report
                            of “brutalization” of their bodies, and the Army is capitalizing on
                            these incidents to build up public support for its position. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, however, has indicated
                            that he is not prepared to move against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, the Air Force, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, or other elements who may have been in on the
                            30 September grab for power. One report indicates that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was in the hands of the Air
                            Force until Sunday and did not know the true situation. Another report
                            states that he now is fully aware of what happened and who were the
                            culprits. The Army has banned the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            newspaper but has made no move against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> headquarters. General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, who seems to have firm control of the military
                            situation in and around Djakarta, went on the radio today with a strong
                            speech denouncing the Air Force for its role in the plot and went to
                            great lengths to build up public support for the Army by describing the
                            brutal slaying of its top generals. This is the first indication we have
                            that the Army may be willing to take issue with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policy of trying to gloss
                            over the events of the last few days.</p>

                        <p>There has not yet been any departure of U.S. dependents from Djakarta via
                            commercial aircraft, although the Embassy indicated that this might
                            begin today. A high Indonesian official (General Rubiono) told the
                            Embassy it would be unwise to evacuate Americans at this time because it
                            would show a lack of confidence in the Army's ability to control the
                            situation. On the other hand there are reports that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> is in central Java organizing
                            several battalions for possible further action against the Army and that

                        <p>There are several current appraisals of the recent course of events, all
                            of which are supported by the sometimes conflicting information. The two
                            major ones are:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> knew what was
                            happening all along and was lying low until he could see who was going
                            to come out on top (presumably he hoped the <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName>
                            coup would succeed and the Army high command would no longer be a threat
                            to his pro-Peking policy).</p>
                        <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was duped into
                            believing that the <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> coup
                            was to save him from a US-sponsored coup by the Army and that he is only
                            now beginning to believe that the Air Force <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> were involved in a plot to get rid of their only major
                            opposition, the Army.</p>
                        <p>If one assumes estimate (1) above to be true, it follows that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will do everything possible
                            to prevent the Army from cracking down on the Air Force and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and that he will continue his previous
                            policy of close relations with Peking and with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, to our disadvantage. He has already
                            made some attempt at playing up the incident as a mere interservice
                            squabble. If we assume that estimate (2) is correct, then it follows
                            that the Army will be given more authority and that people like
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> are out. But, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may fear that if he allows the Army to move too
                            fast against the 30 September Movement, and more particularly against
                            the PKI, civil war will develop and tear the country apart—leaving the

                            and making a great show of national unity, he may be able to prevent
                            disintegration of the Federation and still take care of the elements who
                            sought to topple the government.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to think that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was aware, at least in part, of what was going
                            on from the beginning and that he is now attempting to put the best face
                            on a botched job, hoping to keep his own prestige intact. The big
                            question is whether the Army, having shown its strength and unity in the
                            face of an effort to demolish its influence, will permit <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to exercise the kind of
                            control he had before. In any event, the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> image has been tarnished.</p>
                        <p>The next two days should tell a lot. If the Army turns the Armed Forces
                            Day celebration (October 5) into a big funeral procession for its fallen
                            leaders, the momentum generated could well put the Army into the
                            commanding position in spite of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. However, we cannot underestimate the power of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to manipulate the
                            situation any way he wants, for better or worse. There is probably no
                            other person in Indonesia today who can hold the Federation together,
                            and the Army may well consider this factor more important than taking
                            revenge on the Air Force and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>1. Events of the past few days have put <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and pro-Communist elements very much on defensive and
                            they may embolden army at long last to act effectively against
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>2. At same time we seem to be witnessing what may be the passing of power
                            from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s hands to a
                            figure or figures whose identity is yet unknown, possibly bringing
                            changes in national policy and posture in its wake.</p>
                        <p>3. Right now, our key problem is if we can help shape developments to our
                            advantage, bearing in mind that events will largely follow their own
                            course as determined by basic forces far beyond our capability to
                            control.</p>
                        <p>4. Following guidelines may supply part of the answer to what our posture
                            should be:</p>
                        <p>A. Avoid overt involvement as power struggle unfolds.</p>
                        <p>B. Covertly, however, indicate clearly to key people in army such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> our desire to be of assistance
                            where we can, while at same time conveying to them our assumption that
                            we should avoid appearance of involvement or interference in any
                            way,.</p>
                        <p>C. Maintain and if possible extend our contact with military.</p>
                        <p>D. Avoid moves that might be interpreted as note of nonconfidence in army
                            (such as precipately moving out our dependents or cutting staff).</p>
                        <p>E. Spread the story of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s guilt,
                            treachery and brutality (this priority effort is perhaps most needed
                            immediate assistance we can <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0346"/>give army if we can find way to do it without identifying it as solely
                            or largely US effort).</p>
                        <p>F. Support through information output and such other means as becomes
                            available to us unity of Indonesian armed forces.</p>
                        <p>G. Bear in mind that Moscow and Peking are in basic conflict regarding
                            Indonesia, and that Soviet Union might find itself even more in line
                            with our thinking than at present. This will be subject of our next
                            Country Team meeting and we may have specific recommendations for
                            exploiting this phenomenon.</p>
                        <p>H. Continue to consult closely with friendly embassies (who take up much
                            of our time and occasionally our facilities) extending our line of
                            credit and enhancing our image generally through them as a constructive
                            influence here.</p>
                        <p>I. Continue for time being to maintain low profile and be restrained
                            about any apparent opportunities to rush in with new, overt programs
                            (although need for stepped-up information effort will be great).</p>
                        <p>5. We will submit further recommendations as these seem to be appropriate
                            to what will undoubtedly be fast-moving or at least uncertain situation
                            for some time to come.</p>

                            momentum its offensive against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in
                            face <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s practiced
                            political manipulations.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> sympathizers in Cabinet will be alert
                            to any evidence substantiating their charges that <gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss> will attempt to exploit
                            situation. We believe it essential that we not give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and company opportunity
                            claim that they about to be attacked by <gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss> and that we not give <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> citable public evidence that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> supports Army against them.</p>
                        <p>5. Army clearly needs no material assistance from us at this point. Over
                            past years inter-service relationships developed through training
                            program, civic action program and <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>, as well as regular assurances to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, should have established
                            clearly in minds Army leaders that U.S. stands behind them if they
                            should need help. Reur paras 4 b and c believe we should therefore
                            exercise extreme caution in contacts with the Army lest our well-meaning
                            efforts to offer assistance or steel their resolve may in fact play into

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The Indonesian army, having countered what appears to have been a leftist
                            coup on 1 October, is for the time being firmly in control of Indonesia.
                            It would like to use the opportunity to take strong steps against the
                            Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) and
                            elements allied with it. It would be reluctant to take decisive action,
                            however, without the approval of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, in the interest of
                            national unity and probably fearing the ascendancy of the army, has
                            asserted that the present situation is a political problem that requires
                            a political settlement and that he wishes to settle it himself. He
                            apparently hopes to conciliate the leftists and return the Communist
                            Party to the favorable political position it enjoyed prior to the events
                            of 1 October.</p>
                        <p>1. Early on 1 October a group which called itself the “30 September
                            Movement” kidnapped six army generals, including Army Commander Yani,
                            and later murdered them. The movement was led by Lt. Col. Untung, a
                            battalion commander in President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s bodyguard, the Tjakrabirawa regiment. In
                            addition to <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s own
                            battalion (which was one of three in the regiment), the movement also
                            appears to have included some elements of the air force and initially
                            was openly supported by the Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Dani. Also
                            reportedly <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0349"/>involved were
                            Communist-influenced army elements from Central Java and members of
                            Pemuda Rakjat—the Communist youth organization, the party's special
                            security force, and GERWANI—the Communist women's front group.</p>
                        <p>2. A message read over the Djakarta radio on the morning of 1 October
                            claimed that <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s action was
                            “supported by troops of other branches of the armed forces” and that the
                            “30 September Movement” had acted to forestall an American-inspired
                            “generals' coup.” The message stated that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and other targets of the
                            “generals' coup” were under the protection of the movement. Shortly
                            thereafter the 45 members of a leftist “Revolutionary Council” were
                            announced. About half of the council's membership was composed of
                            government officials, a few of whom were high-level and none of whom at
                            that time was maintaining an anti- or even strong non-Communist
                            position. The council contained three members of the Indonesian
                            Communist Party Central Committee. The rest were well-known fellow
                            travellers or crypto-Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. By the early evening of 1 October Army General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, commander of the Army Strategic
                            Reserve (KOSTRAD), informed all military areas that in the absence of
                            Army Commander General Yani, who had been kidnapped, he was assuming
                            command of the army. He was doing so with the understanding and
                            cooperation of the navy in order to destroy the “30 September Movement.”
                            Two hours later Radio Indonesia announced that the army controlled the
                            situation, that the police had also joined the army and navy to crush
                            the “counterrevolutionary movement,” and that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Defense Minister
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>—the latter had
                            been a target of <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s
                            group—were safe.</p>
                        <p>4. During the night of 1 October, <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Lt. Col.
                                Untung</persName> apparently fled to Central Java where he
                            apparently hoped to establish a position with pro-Communist elements in
                            that province. Repeated broadcasts of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s appeal for restoration of
                            order and the strong pro-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, pro-army stance of both General Sabur—<persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s superior officer in the
                            Tjakrabirawa regiment—and of General Surjosumpeno—army commander in
                            Central Java—appear to have cut away much of <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s following. Reports are confused, however, as to
                            his present support. They range from a mere 110 troops to several
                            battalions. There are no present plans to send additional troops into
                            Central Java to deal with him; loyal troops already stationed in that
                            province are deemed sufficient to cope with the situation.</p>
                        <p>5. On 4 October Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Dani, who had already
                            been absolved of complicity in the “30 September Movement” by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, by implication denied any
                            connection with the movement. In a special broadcast he thanked
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> “for trust in the
                            air force” and <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0350"/>said appropriate
                            action would be taken against any air force personnel involved in the
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>6. Meanwhile President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            had been maneuvering to reaffirm his own control of the situation. On 2
                            October he summoned all military commanders and Second Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ9">Leimena</persName> to a meeting “to
                            settle the 30 September incident immediately.” (First Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> was in
                            North Sumatra but has since returned and is with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Bogor; Third Deputy
                            Prime Minister Chaerul Saleh is en route home from Communist China.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> subsequently
                            broadcast to the nation that he had assumed personal command of the
                            army, that he had appointed General Pranoto, an army headquarters staff
                            officer, administrative head of the army and had deputized General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> “to implement the
                            restoration of security.” A statement by <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> which followed that of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> affirmed the changes made
                            by the president. A 3 October broadcast by the Supreme Operations
                            Command (<gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>) described Pranoto only
                            as “assisting the president.”</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, long regarded as
                            apolitical and possibly an opportunist, emerges in the present situation
                            as a strong military leader and apparently a firm anti-Communist.
                            Pranoto, on the other hand, does not belong to the group of officers who
                            looked to Yani and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> for
                            leadership and obviously is viewed with some disfavor by <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his colleagues. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is said to have elevated
                            Pranoto during the present crisis as a means of conciliating and
                            protecting the left, and it would seem that he also did it as a means of
                            imposing disunity upon the army. Appraisals of Pranoto range from
                            passive and soft on the Communists to actively pro-Communist. He has
                            served in Central Java, a Communist stronghold, as a battalion commander
                            and later as the territorial commander; he is reputed during those years
                            to have done nothing to obstruct Communist growth there. Available
                            information, most of it from pro-<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> sources, has not mentioned any action taken by
                            Pranoto in his present capacity.</p>
                        <p>8. The US Embassy in Djakarta has a confirmed report that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s palace guards and air
                            force troops are protecting <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName>
                            in Bogor. Reportedly, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            troops have their guns trained toward the palace. The US Embassy now
                            believes that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s forces are
                            allowed access to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for
                            bargaining and tape recording <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s statements but they do not control him.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has rejected army
                            suggestions for firm measures against leaders of the “30 September
                            Movement” and the Communist Party. On 4 October he told the army
                            generals that the situation basically involves political issues, that
                            tranquillity and order are needed for a solution, and that the generals
                            should “leave the political settlement to me.” Army officers, initially
                            jubilant at the prospect of cracking <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0351"/>down on the Communists, were reported depressed after
                            their meetings with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>10. Apparently a few hours prior to this 4 October meeting between
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the generals
                            and apparently also under the emotion of having just viewed the exhuming
                            of the murdered generals, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            made an unusual public statement which strongly implied both doubt and
                            criticism of the president and accused the air force and the Communists
                            of complicity in the “30 September Movement.” He stated that the bodies
                            had been found in a well within the jurisdiction of the Halim Air Force
                            Base near Djakarta. He said that an area near the well had been used as
                            an air force training center for volunteers from Pemuda Rakjat (the
                            Communist youth organization) and GERWANI (the Communist women's
                            organization). He went on that “based on these facts, it is possible
                            that there is truth in the statement of our beloved father, President,
                            Supreme Commander, Great Leader of the Revolution, that the air force is
                            not involved in the affair. But it is impossible that there is no
                            connection with this affair among elements of the air force.” Suharto
                            said he conveyed the sentiments of “patriots who are members of the
                            army” that “air force patriots will purge such members (of the air
                            force) who are involved in this adventure.”</p>
                        <p>11. A few hours later, General Sabur in his capacity as Secretary General
                            of the Supreme Operations Command (<gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>) broadcast an account of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s 4 October admonitions to the generals, combat
                            commanders, and all commanders of the armed services. According to
                            Sabur, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had ordered
                            those present, and inferentially all Indonesians, not to permit
                            themselves to be “set off against each other” since this would “harm our
                            struggle and weaken our potential.” Sabur said settlement of the 30
                            September incident would be handled personally and soon by the
                            president. He quoted <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            as warning military leaders “not to fall into the trap of
                            (garble—probably imperialist or neocolonialist) tactics in view of their
                            latest activities for weakening us from inside as a prelude for their
                            attacks against us.” He specifically ordered combat commanders to
                            “realize the danger of intrigue of our adversaries,” to “remain vigilant
                            and continuously enhance unity.” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did manage to say that those who fell victim to
                            the “30 September Movement” were heroes of the revolution, and he
                            invited prayer for their souls.</p>
                        <p>12. The Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>),
                            after indicating its support of the “30 September Movement” through its
                            official newspaper Harian Rakjat, has now largely lapsed into silence.
                            Communist Party leaders apparently are in seclusion or actual hiding.
                            According to a clandestine source, party policy is to disavow the “30
                            September Movement.” Party members caught with arms or found in other
                            ways to be supporting the rebellion will be regarded by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as misguided adventurers.</p>
                        <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>13. The leftist press in Medan, North Sumatra, has continued to publish,
                            and probably is setting the line the party plans to take when its
                            leaders emerge again. The pro-party press in Medan expresses a hope for
                            increased solidarity between the army and the people “particularly in
                            settling the 30 September affair strictly along lines set out by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>14. Many questions remain unanswered about the “30 September Movement.”
                            Most revolve around <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.
                            Did <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> have prior
                            knowledge of the “30 September Movement” and its intentions? Was he
                            taken into protective custody by members of the movement or did he, as
                            he publicly announced, visit Halim Air Force Base—the headquarters of
                            Air Force Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName> and
                            probably the headquarters of the 30 September group—of his own will on 1
                            October because he thought it wise to be near an airplane? Or was his
                            presence there an indication that he, like the air force and the
                            Communist Party, openly and briefly endorsed the movement? Or was this
                            part of the escape route, reportedly engineered by General Sabur, to get
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> out of Djakarta
                            to Bogor? Did <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            appearance of illness during an address on the evening of 30 September
                            motivate the events of 1 October—events which seem to have been
                            previously but perhaps incompletely planned?</p>
                        <p>15. Other questions pertain to <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Lt. Col.
                                Untung</persName> and Communist Party leaders. Most reports claim or
                            assume that <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> was merely a
                            dupe; according to one source, he is a strict Moslem who was outraged by
                            the high living and corrupt practices of high-ranking army officers. If
                            he was only a tool and a front man—and this seems plausible—who did the
                            actual planning? Or did several plans by various elements become
                            entangled, with one being used to justify another?</p>
                        <p>16. It has been reliably reported that the Communist Party in August had
                            reviewed contingency plans which would be put into effect if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> died within the next few
                            days or weeks. These apparently involved the seclusion of top Communist
                            leaders and moves to protect Communist assets by members of the
                            Communist youth front and the party's special security force. There is
                            at least one report that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had agreed to the arrest—by whom was not
                            reported—of the anti-Communist generals but that he did not know of
                            plans to kill them and, had he known, would not have approved them. A
                            high-ranking army source (one of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s physicians and a key figure in army
                            communications), who has occasionally been candid about internal
                            matters, stated on 3 October that among <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s sponsors were armed Communist cadres who had
                            been armed and uniformed. He said <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>'s troops had been among those who had gone to the
                            generals' houses but that it was not clear who had done the
                            firing—implying that uniformed Communists had also been part of the
                            group.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0353"/>
                        <p>17. A plausible view of the immediate background of the “30 September
                            Movement” is that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, and perhaps
                            Communist leaders close to them had considered the arrest of certain
                            army generals. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> have
                            repeatedly and publicly warned the armed forces in recent months that
                            individual leaders must cooperate with the “revolution” or be “left
                            behind.” More recently they have even implied some sort of action
                            against them. With the knowledge of this possibility, militant Communist
                            cadres both inside and outside of the air force (and it seems
                            well-established that such were involved) may have used it to justify
                            action against the generals to <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>, and may have played also upon his resentment of
                            high living among the brass. Young militants are known to be chafing
                            against the peaceful united front tactics espoused by top Communist
                            leaders and the latter's strong support of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The timing of their action
                            could have been influenced by reports on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s illness on the night of 30 September and by
                            partial or garbled knowledge of Communist contingency plans in the event
                            of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s death. The
                            militants—probably impetuous, zealous, and none too clear in their
                            thinking—would have assumed that the swiftness and decisiveness of their
                            actions—the death of the generals and the formation of a new
                            government—would force Sukarno and thereby the rest of Indonesia to fall
                            in behind them.</p>
                        <p>18. Despite Harian Rakjat's brief espousal of the movement it does not
                            seem likely that party chairman <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> would have approved the murder of the generals or
                            even the change of government. The Indonesian situation, both foreign
                            and domestic, was highly favorable to the Communists and—barring
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s immediate
                            death—showed every sign of becoming progressively more so. Possibly a
                            few militant members of the Central Committee approved the plan; future
                            internal party developments may so indicate. The motivation of Air Force
                            Chief of Staff Marshal Dani remains an open question. He has assumed an
                            increasingly leftist position during the past year.</p>
                        <p>19. With the army's counteraction and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s subsequent moves, many of the questions
                            pertaining to the promotion of the “30 September Movement” become almost
                            academic. The principal point now is whether the army will go along with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in papering over
                            the situation and returning to the political status quo prior to the
                            events of 1 October.</p>
                        <p>20. The previous record of the army seems to indicate, that despite
                            frustration and rage over the murders of six highly regarded generals,
                            most officers will continue to support <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Although there is considerable individual and
                            collective doubt among the officer corps as to the wisdom of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s policies, there is also
                            enormous reluctance to oppose him. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has so presented his position that any specific
                            action against the Communists would be considered an anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0354"/>act. It now appears that only
                            if <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> can develop a following
                            in Central Java and renew armed action—and at the moment this does not
                            appear to be a strong possibility—would <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> tolerate a significant move against him and his
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>21. In the aftermath of the “30 September Movement,” however, the army
                            temporarily will retain a political ascendancy. This is based in the
                            martial law still obtaining in Djakarta, in the army's physical control
                            of most of the country, and in the present policy of seclusion being
                            followed by Communist leaders.</p>
                        <p>22. Should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> move too
                            rapidly in favor of the left during this period, he could cause a
                            sharpening of feeling between himself and most army leaders. This could
                            promote a stronger public and political anti-Communist stand by the army
                            than it has maintained in the past year and weaken the political
                            position of the party. Such a development, however, is highly
                            speculative.</p>
                        <p>23. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health continues
                            to be a major factor in determining the course of events. The army is
                            far more likely to act decisively if the president dies or is disabled
                            than if he remains reasonably vigorous. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s continued seclusion is not necessarily an
                            indication that his health has further deteriorated; he will probably
                            defer a public appearance until he feels that it is to his political
                            advantage. Meanwhile he apparently is holding frequent meetings with
                            various military and civilian officials.</p>

                                413<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">In telegram 413 to Djakarta, October
                                7, the Department told <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>
                                it “had serious reservations on wisdom proposal that British convey
                                to Indonesia military willingness to refrain from attacks as long as
                                Indo Army continues to press <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.”
                                No matter how discreetly passed, it would saddle the recipient
                                Indonesian with the danger of “exposure as traitor to nation.” The
                                Department then suggested that the Indonesian military was
                                sophisticated enough to realize that the British “would not stab
                                Army in back while dealing with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>”
                                without being specifically informed. (National Archives and Records
                                Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–1966, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> INDON–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>)</note> that “we should credit Indo military with
                            sufficient sophistication to realize that British would not stab Indo
                            army in back while it was dealing with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.” Latter contention overlooks suspiciousness of
                            hard-pressed army and its poor communications. We just cannot leave to
                            chance that Indos will understand British restraint.</p>
                        <p>3. In latter connection, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_EWG1">Ethel</persName> was told today by his Indo army contact (who is
                            close to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>) that Indo army hopes British
                            will not escalate Malaysia confrontation at this time because it would
                            weaken army position. Source believes US only nation which could bring
                            pressure to bear on British on this matter. Later on in conversation,
                            source stated that Indo army leadership feels it has situation well in
                            hand and will win this time, provided British do not interfere by
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>4. I therefore recommend that <persName corresp="#p_EWG1">Ethel</persName> reply to his contact just about along lines
                            Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName> suggests. This would of course
                            require that British desisted from any kind of aggressive patrolling but
                            it should not involve any weakening of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            defensive position.<note n="4" xml:id="d151fn4">In telegram 437 to
                                Djakarta, October 10, the Department agreed with <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s recommendation, but asked
                                that the Embassy withhold action until the matter was cleared with
                                the British. (Ibid.) In telegram 1918 to London, repeated to
                                Djakarta as telegram 446, the Department reported that Berger had
                                suggested to a British Embassy official that the United States pass
                                the following message to the Indonesians: “First, we wish to assure
                                you that we have no intention of interfering Indonesian internal
                                affairs directly or indirectly. Second we have good reason to
                                believe that none of our allies intend any offensive action against
                                Indonesia.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–9 INDON)
                                The British agreed, but asked that the phrase, “to initiate,” be
                                included between “allies intend” and “any offensive action.”

                            The harder question is their request for our assessment of the

                            and he (Cuthell) has great fears and doubts of our expressing
                            encouragement, etc. This is a complex power fight that is going on and
                            we do not know who is on top and we do not know, for instance, whether
                            the army might resolve this by declaring a war on imperialists and we
                            would be left on the limb by the army moving in and exploiting
                            anti-American feelings. The Secretary thought this a very far-fetched
                            likelihood. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this is not
                            an ideological fight but a power fight. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thinks that any indication that we are giving army

                        <p>1. We think time is approaching when it may be desirable to give some
                            indication to the military of our attitudes toward recent and current
                            developments. While we might do this by taking advantage of request for
                            our assessment put to us by <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide (reftel paras 1 and 2), we are reserved
                            for three reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. We are not at all clear as to who is calling the shots within the
                            military. As examples: although it appears to be <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> seems to be taking a stronger line vis-a-vis
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. We do not know
                            who else is playing what role, or what degree of unity exists among the

                        <p>b. We have no real knowledge of the military plans and intentions or what
                            debates are going on in the inner circle, without which it is impossible
                            to make an assessment.</p>
                        <p>c. We are not even certain that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide is really speaking for him, or has taken
                            initiative on his own.</p>
                        <p>2. Under these circumstances we think it would be best to move
                            cautiously.</p>
                        <p>3. Dilemma is that (a) we do not wish to give army impression that we are
                            trying to inject ourselves into Indo internal situation, or that we wish
                            to channel army's actions for our—as opposed to Indo's—benefit, or that
                            we encouraging action against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> or, in fact, anyone except <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. On other hand, (b) if army's
                            willingness to follow through against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is in any way contingent on or subject to influence by
                            US, we do not wish miss opportunity consider US action. As noted 1 c
                            above, we not sure whether Indos making typically over-subtle approach
                            via <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to aide's question re our assessment of situation,
                            suggest you respond on following lines: We are, as always, sympathetic
                            to army's desire eliminate communist influence, but difficult for us to
                            assess current situation since we do not have clear picture of military
                            aims and plans. Realize situation fast moving, but would be helpful if
                            we could be given indication to army's assessment and intentions.</p>

                            Many basic issues will remain unresolved. Prolonged maneuvering <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0362"/>among the various elements is
                            likely and, whatever the outcome, the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> image and leadership will never be quite the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>2. The following basic factors underlie Indonesia's present political
                            maneuvering:</p>
                        <p>A. There are now two power centers in Indonesia, not one. These are
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the army.
                            Each needs the other and at the same time each is trying to undermine
                            the other. But in true Indonesian fashion they are trying to reach an
                            agreed settlement which will give the outward impression that all is
                            well and that national unity has been preserved.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s image has been
                            damaged but there is little likelihood of any serious move to dump him.
                            Many Indonesians privately believe he was aware of, or even back of, the
                            Sept 30 affair. Nonetheless, they do not want to make this fact public
                            or to face openly its logical consequences. They will probably whitewash
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, for to them, and
                            despite his faults, he is Indonesia and national unity depends on
                            allegiance to his father figure, but the army, for its part, finds its
                            public support of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> a
                            useful symbol that it is the protector of national unity.</p>
                        <p>C. The present political jockeying takes place in an atmosphere of
                            considerable national tension. The attacks on <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> installations which started in Djakarta have spread to
                            other regions of Indonesia. In some areas it could strike a spark
                            leading to the outbreak of real conflict. The army regards central Java
                            as politically sensitive, even though the security situation has been
                            brought into line. Communists and non-Communists have been at each
                            other's throats in east Java and in north Sumatra for months and some
                            observers fear civil war in those areas. This situation cuts both ways
                            for the army. It strengthens the hand of the military in bargaining with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> who fears
                            national disunity. But the army also fears civil war, particularly in
                            any situation which would pit them publicly against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who might rally forces
                            against the army that would make their position untenable, and thus move
                            the army toward compromise.</p>
                        <p>D. The basic framework of Indonesia's domestic ideology will be retained
                            but there will probably be changes of emphasis, for the present at
                            least, and possibly and hopefully of longer duration. Elements such as
                                <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> will not be completely
                            dominant theme they had become in recent months although lip service
                            will probably continue to be paid to these concepts. In this connection,
                            song “<gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> Unity” is now heard
                            again on radio after two week absence. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> also expressed support for <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> at his installation ceremony.
                                (<gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> is, of course, the
                            Indonesian acronym and cover for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s drive to establish a Communist-oriented
                            Indonesian political unity. That Moslem elements maintain a healthy
                            resistance to this forced adjustment <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0363"/>of their religious convictions to Communist ideology
                            has become apparent in a way that is both surprising and heartening
                            during these last few days.)</p>
                        <p>E. No dramatic changes in Indonesia's foreign policy are likely. The army
                            and large sections of the Indonesian public suspects Communist China's
                            hand behind recent events. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> does not, or at least he will not admit this
                            possibility. However, as one general said, “We already have enough
                            enemies. We can't take on Communist China as well.” The Sept 30 affair
                            will almost certainly cause strains between Djakarta and Peiping, but
                            close cooperation will probably continue because both parties find it
                            useful. But there latent explosiveness against the Chinese in the minds
                            of many, particularly strong Moslem elements, among the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>F. Indonesia's basic “anti-<gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss>”
                            policy will probably also be retained although the army may well seek to
                            twist definition of the term when this suits the army's purposes.</p>
                        <p>3. Appears likely that partial deal between army and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may already have been
                            reached while other matters are still under negotiation. (It is even
                            more commonplace here than elsewhere to come up with vague phraseology
                            to reach agreement on obstinate points leaving future in-fighting to
                            determine final outcome.)</p>
                        <p>A. One side of deal may be that army will hush up any indications of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s involvement in
                            Sept 30 affair. We have in fact already noted that army sources are now
                            playing this down following earlier open talk that President was
                            involved. Army has probably also agreed to continuation of certain
                            essential aspects of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s foreign policy and this will produce competition
                            and perhaps confusion in weeks ahead.</p>
                        <p>B. There are several different versions of army's five point demands on
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> but these appear
                            generally to involve following: (I) Appointment of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> head army, (II) all persons
                            involved in Sept 30 movement to be punished in accordance with Indo law,
                            (III) Indo air force to be retooled, (IV) all mass organizations and
                            political parties which supported Sept 30 movement to be banned, and (V)
                            replacement of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s intelligence
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>C. Appointment of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is only
                            point in above list which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has completely carried out. He has agreed to
                            send <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName> abroad but has not yet
                            selected a regular replacement for him as head of air force. Army, of
                            course, is going ahead on its own to punish many of those involved in
                            Sept 30 movement.</p>
                        <p>4. While firm evidence lacking we believe there are two major ways in
                            which internal political crisis might be resolved. First in formation of
                            new “pure” and “indigenous” Communist Party to replace bad old <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would probably like new party to be headed by
                                <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0364"/>Njoto but this would be
                            subject to negotiation. This seems more likely outcome, but possibility
                            of single national party should not be ruled out. Both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> have in past advocated
                            one-party system of substitution of “National Front” for all parties
                            although they would have different views on nature of single party. Army
                            leadership wants complete ban of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            but, if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> insists,
                            would reportedly propose single party which, in contrast to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, they would want to be
                            “right-wing” with heavy representation of “functional groups.”</p>
                        <p>5. Activities of Indo press and other information media here are almost
                            certain to be continued bone of contention between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his backers and army
                            leadership and other anti-Communists. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will want to push his anti-<gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss> program in which he identifies
                            Indonesia with other Communist countries. He will want to play down
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> complexion which has been
                            introduced under recent army direction of Indo information media. Army
                            still seems dissatisfied with activities of Indonesia's sole news
                            agency, Antara, and continues to interrogate and harass its staff which,
                            of course, was heavily Communist infected.</p>
                        <p>6. The activities of the National Front, especially those relating to
                            demonstrations (that peculiarly Indonesian method of political
                            expression), will probably, like the press, be subject to tugging and
                            pulling between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            his leftist advisers and the army.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and army may
                            already have reached ostensible, modus vivendi, on basic political
                            issues. If not, odds are that they will in near future. However, working
                            out details will be serious problem, as will probable differences of
                            interpretation between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and army on points already accepted. While
                            recent crisis is likely to be papered over, basic problems have been
                            brought to surface and will not easily or successfully or for very long
                            be sublimated. Role of <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, and others in cabinet spiritually akin to if
                            not active in September 30 movement, many of whom now appear likely to
                            survive present crisis, will be source continued friction between
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and army. But
                            issues, such as those mentioned above, and many others including
                            personal feelings of revenge, are likely continue plague <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and reduce effectiveness and cohesion
                            of government for foreseeable future.</p>

                        <p>1. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_EWG1">Ethel</persName> has had two more
                            meetings with <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide
                            who made a number of interesting points as follows:</p>
                        <p>2. Police say they have caught <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> in central Java, but this fact is not being
                            released now. For publication, he remains still at large. One reason
                            given for this is to obstruct <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> from
                            naming new head of party.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> trusts <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> about 80 percent of the time
                            and discussions continue between them. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has been pressing for accept- ance of five
                            following points, first two of which already granted: (a) appointment of

                            master-minded by the <gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss>s, to be
                            executed by the army, navy and police, against the air force. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has told <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> that he wants all the facts
                            of this 30 September incident in order to reach his final political
                            solution on current crisis. The army is working hard, along with police,
                            to get the facts and they already have a good deal of incriminating
                            evidence against <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            and others.</p>
                        <p>5. There is a major split between <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SK1">Suwito</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>'s Chief Deputy in the Foreign Office).
                                <persName corresp="#p_SK1">Suwito</persName> has the support of
                            almost all the foreign office.</p>
                        <p>6. If <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has anything
                            to say about it, it is questionable how long <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> can remain as Army Chief of Staff. There is
                            strong mutual dislike between them. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not wish to appoint
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, but was forced to do
                            so by <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. Earlier report we had from another source to effect that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was ousting Sughardi as
                            information officer of Department of Defense <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0366"/>is not true. It is true that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at first considered
                            Sughardi as being too outspoken against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and Tjakrabirawa, but <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has relented, partly because he now knows more
                            of the facts and partly because Sughardi used to be one of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s aides. Sughardi now sees
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> every day.</p>
                        <p>8. There is danger of trouble in the navy, where <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> is attempting to stir
                            up dissidence. Martadinata is aware of this and is trying to head it
                            off.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> is proving to be a
                            problem to his interrogators who have been unable to extract much of
                            interest from him. (Note that this conflicts with a German Embassy
                            source, but we believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide's information correct.)</p>
                        <p>10. Army is now screening all of its officers to eliminate those who are
                            untrustworthy. In past several days forty have been picked up for
                            detention, including Lt. Col. Soewasono who, working directly under
                            General Pronoto, was largely responsible for personnel assignments and
                            who used his office for infiltration of leftists into key spots.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">General Comment:</hi> In reviewing telegrams I have
                            drafted during past two weeks reporting Colonel <persName corresp="#p_EWG1">Ethel</persName>'s regular contacts with <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide, I gain distinct
                            impression that army is proceeding methodically against Communists and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, though being
                            prepared to co-exist with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for reasons Embassy has recently reported in
                            detail. Also looking back over record I note that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s aide has given us much
                            accurate information as to up-coming developments, which helps to
                            establish his reliability as well as fact that army leadership seems to
                            know where it is going, at least in short run.</p>

                        <p>1090. 1. Army and other actions against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> have been covered in detail in our sitreps and regular
                                reporting.<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">In telegram 923 from
                                Djakarta, October 8, the Embassy reported that the Army had arrested
                                several thousand <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> activists and
                                it has recovered many, but far from all, of the weapons distributed
                                to Communist troops. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                                23–9 INDON)</note> Question now is extent to which party's
                            effectiveness and potential have actually been impaired.</p>
                        <p>2. While situation still fluid, evidence to date indicates party has
                            received major, though not necessarily mortal, blow to its image,
                            considerable damage to its communications and command structures, and
                            some damage to its organizational strength through arrest, harassment
                            and, in some cases, execution of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            cadres.</p>
                        <p>3. Extent of this damage cannot be definitely fixed but is certainly
                            significant. In area of communications and command, we have direct
                            evidence [less than 1 line of source text not declassified] that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> itself already regarded its
                            communications to be virtually shattered a week or so ago, even before
                            army repression had reached its peak. Some thousand of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> cadres have reportedly been arrested in
                            Djakarta area alone and several hundred of them have been executed. We
                            know that Njono, head of Djakarta <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            and Politburo member, was arrested and may have been executed and there
                            are unconfirmed reports of other arrests of top leaders including Anwar
                            Snauee. Army sweeps of Kampung areas have also disrupted channels of
                            communication, and loss of buildings, effects of curfew in Djakarta
                            shut-down of telephone and telegraph system, etc., are forcing <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to employ inefficient and cumbersome
                            devices no matter how well prepared their underground network may have
                            been.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus far, however, basic <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            organizational potential would appear to be largely intact and capable
                            of recovering quickly in a purely organizational sense if its status
                            were recognized by the government and army attacks were stopped.
                            However, there would still be severe damage to its image that, taken by
                            itself, would tend to impair recruitment and decrease possibilities for
                            successful prosecution of United Front tactics. Also, even now party
                            will face uphill fight in regaining degree of popular acceptance and
                            ostensible prestige it enjoyed before Sept 30. At same time, if return
                            of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> did take place and could be <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0368"/>shown as sign of anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> weakness and indication that opposition
                            to <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was useless, loss popular image
                            could be at least partially offset by psychology of intimation and by
                            terror.</p>
                        <p>5. If army repression of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> continues
                            and army refuses to give up its position of power to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> strength can be cut back. In long run, however, army
                            repression of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will not be successful
                            unless it is willing to attack communism as such, including associations
                            with China and other bloc countries and Communist ideology, including
                            many of key pillars of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> doctrine. Army has nevertheless been working
                            hard at destroying <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and I, for one,
                            have increasing respect for its determination and organization in
                            carrying out this crucial assignment.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> capability for insurgency reported
                                septel.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">In telegram 1098 from Djakarta,
                                October 20, the Embassy stated it had no real evidence that the

                                balance, the Embassy concluded that the Army could cope with
                                insurgency on a national basis, but it would have serious and
                                perhaps prolonged trouble rooting the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> out of some areas of Java and North Sumatra. The
                                Embassy added that should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> side with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, the difficulties would be greatly increased.

                        <p>508. 1. Following thoughts on current and prospective Indo situation are
                            based primarily on Mission's excellent reporting during past few weeks,
                            are tentative, and are intended to solicit Embassy's comment.</p>
                        <p>2. Main elements current situation are:</p>
                        <p>a. Indo Army still cleaning up situation;</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> resisting
                            elimination <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and trying to reassert
                            control;</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> apparently undecided between
                            pursuing legal struggle if possible or resorting to insurgency and
                            terrorism;</p>
                        <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0369"/>
                        <p>d. Non-communist civilians who have been inactive in past years becoming
                            actively anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, but their leaders
                            still much in background and not playing major role. Situation likely
                            settle down slowly in some new pattern. To date and probably in near
                            future issue regarded as domestic (except for question of Chicom
                            involvement), and our only role has been to give quiet assurance that we
                            and allies will not interfere. As situation takes new shape believe it
                            likely Army and perhaps others who will be responsible for running
                            country will feel need to know our position toward their regime.</p>
                        <p>3. Obviously premature to assess what shape new situation will take.
                            Alternatives seem to include, in broad terms,</p>
                        <p>a. Restoration pre-September 30 situation—i.e. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-run <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> dominated Indonesia;</p>
                        <p>b. Some version of <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> with Army
                            having ultimate responsibility for success, and “KOM” being successor to
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>c. Army-backed, and in part operated, civilian regime with substantial
                            Marxist-Socialist civilian component;</p>
                        <p>d. Out and out Army regime.</p>
                        <p>4. In unlikely event a. above develops, our relations with Indo clearly
                            back where they were and probably much worse. d. seems equally unlikely
                            in view <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s and Army's
                            often stated desire avoid military vs. civilian situation and importance
                            military has long given to need for development anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, non-communist civilian government.
                            This course would also involve direct challenge to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and subject Army's real
                            cohesion to major and unwanted test (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1098).<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">See <ref target="#d158fn3">footnote 3, Document 158</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. b. and c. above, which we currently believe more likely, are
                            essentially variants of same situation but probably with different
                            internal backgrounds. b. implies settlement with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> which tolerates existence
                            weakened <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, while c. might well result
                            in <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> hard core being out of power,
                            underground, and engaged in insurgency and terrorism. Likelihood in both
                            cases is that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            would be out or reduced to non-control position, while <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, if present, would not have
                            final authority in basic issues.</p>
                        <p>6. Regardless of which form new regime takes it will be faced by three
                            major problems apart from basic issue internal security:</p>
                        <p>a. Priorities: While operating behind facade of current domestic policies
                            regime will be oriented more toward Indonesians' domestic problems, and
                            this in turn will mean greater attention to long neglected and critical
                            economic problems.</p>

                                Embassy noted: “There is a subtle but important difference in

                            <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is one thing, communism another. As
                            most educated Indos have large Marxist element in their thinking, regime
                            will have to try to educate opinion slowly to recognize that communism
                            is more than economic theory, and that it is not simply aggressive form
                            Indonesian nationalism (para 5 your 1090).<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">

                        <p>7. New regime will obviously need external aid to deal with economy. Will
                            have difficult task of doing so while handicapped by foreign policy and
                            hobbled by confusion on economic theory. Despite this problem,
                            approaches to Thai, Japanese, Germans and apparently others which
                            already made will have to extend toward something more formal than
                            simple search for emergency bailing out in terms of food.</p>
                        <p>8. Basic to getting such foreign assistance will be establishment abroad
                            of fact that Indonesia has new face, and in this Indos likely want to
                            know how U.S. views them and what position U.S. will be conveying to
                            other countries whether or not Indos choose seek direct help from us. As
                            Indos probe us on question, and recognizing we dealing in still very
                            hypothetical situation, suggest our description of our attitude should
                            include following:</p>
                        <p>a. Like Indo Army, we have long assumed that at what it considered
                            appropriate time <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would make overt
                            bid for power. We were surprised that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> chose present period for open assault re Army, as
                            events in past months seemed to us to have been moving steadily in
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s favor. Only tenable conclusion
                            we have been able reach after considerable study of available info is
                            that Aidit and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> were under heavy
                            pressure from Chicoms to produce abrupt and prompt victory for Chicom
                            interests in Asia in view recent setbacks for Chinese in Africa and
                            elsewhere—without, of course, considering Indo interests.</p>
                        <p>b. Our hope continues to be that Indos will produce government and policy
                            dedicated to Free Indonesia and to full development of country for
                            benefit of Indo people;</p>
                        <p>c. As Army and non-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> elements move into
                            control of and responsibility for welfare of country they are going to
                            have to take rapid and effective steps to correct current economic mess,
                            and for this they <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0371"/>will need
                            foreign help. Indos have many friends in non-communist world who have
                            long desired help, their objectives ranging from desire see Indo
                            strength develop as force supporting freedom of other states to simple
                            desire for normal and mutually profitable trade and commerce. We unaware
                            of any free country which foolish enough to wish simply “exploit”
                            Indonesia or its people in colonial sense. We are disposed to help Indos
                            locate such help if they wish, but believe they will find it available
                            without difficulty;</p>
                        <p>d. Our own bilateral relations have been poisoned by sea of hatred (of
                            sort which produced September 30) which <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has poured into Indonesia in past years. We recognize
                            this background cannot be eliminated over night nor can it be ignored by
                            Indo Government or by us;</p>
                        <p>e. In view foregoing, we assume Indos will want avoid anything looking
                            like overt <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> turn toward U.S. For
                            short run our assistance to them would probably have to be on covert or
                            semi-covert basis related specific, small, ad hoc needs. We quite
                            willing go along with this. In addition showing Indos we will not take
                            advantage of difficult internal situation to intervene, we recognize
                            probable need for passage of time to allow cooling off period, and will
                            not seek or expect public evidences of pro-American feeling. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Further down road we would hope
                            situation might stabilize to point where structured economic support
                            along lines 1963 consortium idea could be considered, but think
                            speculation about this, except as indicated sub-para c. above, not
                            likely be useful in near future. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.);</p>
                        <p>f. If real <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> insurgency situation
                            develops we would, of course, try to meet Army needs as expressed to us
                            by Army. Problem here could be continuation military aspects of
                            confrontation and continuation stridently aggressive anti-American
                            propaganda. If former stopped or suspended and latter moderated, we
                            believe U.S. public and Congress would go along.</p>
                        <p>9. Foregoing obviously very tentative but believe Department and Embassy
                            should try to agree on main lines of U.S. response if and as Indos probe
                            our position in days and weeks ahead. Embassy's comments requested.<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">In telegram 1236 from Djakarta, October 27,
                                the Embassy agreed with this analysis and recommendations. The
                                Embassy recommended that the Department explore the possibility of
                                “short-term, one-shot aid on covert, non attributable basis assuming
                                Indo Army clearly solicits such aid.” The Embassy was less
                                pessimistic than the Department about changes in Indonesian foreign
                                policy, especially towards China. (National Archives and Records

                        <p>Events in Indonesia since the abortive September 30th coup are so far a
                            striking vindication of U.S. policy towards that nation in recent years:
                            a policy of keeping our hand in the game for the long-term stakes
                            despite recurrent pressures to pull out, break relations, recall our
                            Ambassador, etc. More specifically, they are a vindication of our
                            post-1963 approach and the recommendations of last spring's <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> Report.</p>
                        <p>In the past week we have continued to grope with the obscure but very
                            promising forces set free by the defeat of the September 30th plot.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s early analysis
                            that there are now two Indo Governments—<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the Army—still seems valid; and since each
                            Government needs the other (or rather, is too weak to topple the other),
                            the uneasy balance may continue for a while. The Army is showing
                            considerable courage, and the populace is with the Army to an
                            extraordinary degree so far. Our Embassy is performing well.</p>
                        <p>Important unknowns remain: <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health, his degree of involvement in the
                            September 30th plot, the whereabouts of <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> (reportedly under arrest), anti-Chinese passions,
                            etc. Whatever happens, we should expect no abrupt major change in
                            Indonesia's vocal fuzzy Marxism or in its foreign policy—regardless of
                            who runs the country. The longer we remain restrained and discreet (and
                            the same for our press), the better.</p>

                                Intelligence Agency's Office of Current Intelligence also prepared
                                an analysis of the 30 of September Movement, OCI No. 2342/65,
                                October 28. The memorandum's summary stated that the purpose of the
                                coup was to “destroy the army leadership and presumably to redirect
                                the army's political thrust,” but beyond these ends the motivation
                                of Untung and Vice Air Marshal Yani remained unclear. As for the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, elements were involved, but
                                the “role of the party leadership remains obscure.” (Johnson

                            believe we now have adequate information for informed assessment and
                            suggest report be given wide dissemination. Following for immediate use

                        <p>2. Sept 30 Movement. This Movement consisted of several army units, air
                            force chief and several of his colleagues, and paramilitary elements
                            formed from Communist cadres. Leaders included Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> of Palace Guard (tough,
                            dissatisfied soldier with Communist background); Army Brig. Gen.
                            Supardjo (Pontianak); Lt. Col. Heru (Air Force Intelligence); and Navy
                            Col. Sunardi. Principal culprits, however, are at very top: <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> and his <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, Omar <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName> and
                            elements of his air force. Communist China was involved, at least to
                            extent of supplying several thousand guns which smuggled into Indonesia
                            and distributed to Communist <gloss target="#t_RBP1">RBP</gloss>. There
                            circumstantial evidence that Peking aware of or perhaps even had hand in
                            plot but this not established.</p>
                        <p>3. Objective. Plot probably had two options: (a) total coup except for
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, or (b) limited
                            coup involving removal of army leadership. Plot perhaps failed because
                            it climaxed between these two. Additional complicating factor is
                            likelihood that not all elements were working for same objective.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>, for example, appears
                            to have been fall guy who went along because of pro-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> sympathies and resentment over high
                            living of top <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> leaders. Others
                                (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName>, possibly <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>) probably wanted to cut army down to size now in
                            order accelerate <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            rapid “turn of wheel” to left. Possible fear of army pre-emptive coup
                            may have sparked move but this not known.</p>

                        <p>4. What Probably Happened. At 0200 Oct 1 less than three battalions army
                            troops began move and by 0400 had sealed off palace, taken telegraph
                            office, telecommunications building and perhaps National Bank, and
                            assumed position around Merdeka Square. Other key objectives obtained
                            through inside cooperation. Between 0300 and 0500 raids by element army,
                            Palace Guard and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> youth occurred on
                            homes of 7 top generals resulting in murder Gen. Pandjaitan, kidnapping
                            (with some wounded) of Gens. Yani, Soetojo, Parman, Harjono, Suprapto.
                            Armed Forces Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> escaped over wall and Gen. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> apparently missed because he not
                            at home. Generals and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s
                            aide were hauled off to secluded spot on grounds Halim Air Force [Base]
                            and tortured and murdered. Mutilated bodies found Oct 3. There seemed to
                            be no close coordination in provinces except possibly central Java where
                            Sept 30 Movement forces held several points briefly and Joga changed
                            hands several times before reverting to government control Oct 4.</p>
                        <p>5. Movement forced into early retreat by quick reaction under Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> of Strategic Command
                            (Kostrad) and dwindling support for <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>. During evening Oct 1 <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, joined by cavalry battalion from Adjie's
                            Siliwangi division recaptured strategic points and secured city. Rebel
                            troops retreated to Halim; <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName>
                            and Air Force Chief <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Omar Dani</persName> flew
                            to his Swahjudi air force base near Madiun early Oct 2. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> went to Bogor Palace.</p>
                        <p>6. Probable Role of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Since 1952
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has pursued United Front
                            strategy proceeding cautiously toward peaceful transition into socialist
                            stage. In mid Sept party began taking vigorous security measures.
                            Whether it feared army attack or was itself preparing for coup attempt
                            not known. In any event there no question of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> involvement in Sept movement. <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> and other top leaders almost
                            certainly in on planning, <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> unions in
                            transport and communications fields assisted movement and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> newspaper was only one to support it.
                            Whether timing was triggered by concern <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s health or fear imminent army coup, <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> decision to participate seems to have
                            been hurried one.</p>
                        <p>7. Role of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Many
                            knowledgeable Indonesians join most foreign diplomats here in believing
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> involved in Sept
                            30 Movement, although extent his complicity not clear. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s long term political
                            record of close association with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            merged over past year into virtual public identification with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. On Sept 29 in speech to Communist
                            youth, he referred to former “loyal generals” who had become “protectors
                            of counter-revolutionary elements. These we must crush.” Important
                            circumstantial evidence lays critical questions at <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s door. His actions during
                            and after coup are suspect, including his lack of any real public
                            remorse over murdered generals. There are reservations, but odds seem
                            overwhelming that, at very least, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0375"/>knew what was afoot and had
                            given tacit blessing to seizure of generals, probably having let himself
                            be convinced (not a hard job) that they planning coup against him. He
                            may not however have been in on all details.</p>
                        <p>8. What Went Wrong. Coup came dangerously close to success. It perhaps
                            failed because of differing objectives of those involved and fact it
                            climaxed between being standard coup attempt and pure act of terror.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ULC1">Untung</persName> quickly gained control
                            of capital, and <persName corresp="#p_DO1">Dani</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> came to his support. However,
                            army regrouped quickly around <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, masses failed to rise against “capitalist
                            bureaucrats,” and it possible <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> backed out when he learned generals killed and
                            all not going well.</p>
                        <p>9. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has received serious setback to
                            prestige and organization. Road back will be long one but with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s support party could
                            eventually make it if army permits. This is key to situation.</p>
                        <p>B. Seems army will not now move directly against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, whom they probably believe
                            necessary as symbol national unity.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> likely remain
                            single most important figure in Indonesia but will not for foreseeable
                            future regain power and prestige he had before Sept 30.</p>
                        <p>D. To date army has performed far better than anticipated in attacking
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and regrouping. Degree to which
                            it will stand up to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            not yet proven, but seems almost certain army will continue exercise
                            considerable restraining influence on him.</p>
                        <p>E. Communists could cause considerable difficulty through insurgency,
                            strikes or mass action but will probably not resort to this tactic
                            except as very last resort. Some elements in army hope <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will take to hills so army can use its
                            military strength against them.</p>
                        <p>F. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dies in near
                            future, recent events give major boost to army in assuming effective
                            control and countering <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>G. Comments on implications recent events for Indonesian foreign policy
                            reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1166<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">In telegram 1166 from Djakarta, October 23, the
                                Embassy suggested that the outcome of the power struggle between
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the Army
                                had the potential for a significant shift in Indonesia's foreign
                                policy. Complete victory by the Army might well make expansionism
                                and concomitant anti-Westernism outmoded. Even a partial Army
                                victory would produce a change for the better. The central question
                                was how to help the Army to win, but without revealing that
                                assistance and thereby becoming a handicap rather than an asset.

                        <p>The Embassy in Djakarta was hampered in its reporting on events in the
                            areas outside the capital by the general confusion and chaos of the
                            initial conflict between the Partai Komunis Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) on one hand and the Indonesian Army
                            and anti-Communist forces on the other. At first the Embassy viewed the
                            fighting and violence as a potential military/guerrilla conflict and
                            concentrated on the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s armed activity
                            and its potential for terrorism. In telegram 1215 from Djakarta, October
                            27, 1965, the Embassy recounted multiple reports of increasing
                            insecurity and mounting bloodshed in Central Java, but could not
                            determine whether it was caused by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> moving towards terrorism and sabotage, “local <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> cadres reacting uncoordinatedly to
                            pressures upon them,” or the Army “purposely moving to wipe out
                            questionable elements and gain control.” (National Archives and Records
                            Administration, RG 84, Djakarta Embassy Files: Lot 69 F 42, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23) On October 28 the Embassy reported
                            that a <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> source alleged that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was about to engage in a “war of
                            liberation” and cited incidents of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            terrorism to support this conclusion. The telegram stated, “There [is]
                            no question, even allowing for exaggeration, that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> acts of terrorism have increased.”
                            (Telegram 1248 from Djakarta, October 28; ibid., RG 59, Central Files
                            1964–66, POL 23–9 INDON) On October 28 the Embassy Country Team reviewed
                            the situation and sent its appraisal. Although the report emphasized the
                            deteriorating security situation in Central Java, East Java, Bandung,
                            and Djakarta, the team could not say “whether these incidents were
                            isolated acts of local communists or beginning of a coordinated act of
                            terror and sabotage.” The report concluded that Indonesia was heading
                            for a “period of chaos, since <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has
                            residual strength and arms, but balance seems on Army side.” (Telegram
                            1255 from Djakarta; October 28; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>At the end of October 1965, the Embassy began to receive reports of
                            killings and atrocities against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            members, which were generally reported upon in the context of continued
                            armed <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> resistance. On October 29 the
                            Embassy reported that “Moslem fervor in Atjeh apparently put all but few
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> out of action. Atjehnese have
                            decapitated <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and placed their heads
                            on stakes along the road. Bodies of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            victims reportedly thrown into rivers or sea as Atjehnese refuse
                            'contaminate Atjeh soil.' ” (Telegram 1269 from Djakarta; October 29;
                            ibid., RG 84, Djakarta Embassy Files: Lot 69 F 42, <gloss target="#t_POL1">Pol</gloss> 23–9) By November 8 the Embassy
                            reported that in North Sumatra and Atjeh “the Army with the help of
                            IP–KI Youth organizations and other anti-Communist elements has
                            continued systematic drive to destroy <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in northern Sumatra with wholesale killings reported.”
                            On November 13 the Embassy had a report from the local police chief that
                            “from 50 to 100 <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0377"/>members were being killed every
                            night in East and Central Java by civilian anti-Communist troops with
                            blessing of the Army.” A missionary in Surabaya reported that 3,500
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> were killed between November 4
                            and 9 in Kediri and 300 at Paree, 30 kilometers northwest of Kediri.
                            (Telegrams 1374 and 1438 from Djakarta, November 8 and 13, and telegram
                            171 from Surabaya, November 13; ibid.) These types of anecdotal reports
                            continued well into the first months of 1966. In airgram A–527 from
                            Djakarta, February 25, 1966, the Embassy reported estimates of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> death toll in Bali at 80,000
                            with “no end in sight.” The Embassy attributed the murders to sharp
                            conflict there between <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and the
                            Indonesian National Party (<gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>), but
                            also to the “tradition of family blood feuds” and suggested that “many
                            of the killings that are taking place under a political cover are
                            actually motivated by personal and clan vendettas.” (Ibid., RG 59,
                            Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–9

                        <p>Gradually the Embassy came to realize that Indonesia was undergoing a
                            full scale purge of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence and
                            that these killings were overlaid with long standing and deep ethnic and
                            religious conflicts. The fact that many of the killings took place in
                            outlying areas tended to obscure their magnitude. The Embassy still had
                            no good estimates of the number of Indonesians who perished. In airgram
                            A–641 to the Department, April 15, 1966, the Embassy stated that the
                            problem was the impossibility of weighing “the countervailing effects of
                            exaggeration (which is especially common in Indonesia) and the interests
                            of persons involved to cover up some of the crimes. The truth can never
                            be known. Even the Indonesian Government has only a vague idea of the
                            truth.” The Embassy admitted, “We frankly do not know whether the real
                            figure is closer to 100,000 or 1,000,000 but believe it wiser to err on
                            the side of the lower estimates, especially when questioned by the
                            press.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 2 INDON)</p>
                        <p>In 1970, Foreign Service Officer Richard Cabot Howland, an officer at the
                            Embassy in Indonesia in 1965 and 1966, published an article in the
                            classified publication, <hi rend="italic">Studies in Intelligence</hi>
                            (Vol. 14, Fall 1970, pages 13–28) which has subsequently been
                            declassified and is available at the National Archives and Records
                            Administration, RG 263, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Records, <hi rend="italic">Studies in Intelligence</hi>. Howland's article
                            attempts to refute three misconceptions popular at the time of his
                            article: that the Indonesian military was encouraged to move against the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> by the forceful U.S. stance in
                            Vietnam, that the Chinese were behind the September 30 coup attempt, and
                            that from 350,000 to 1.5 million <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            members were killed in reaction to the September 30 coup. Howland
                            described his own efforts in Indonesia to elicit information from
                            Indonesians in 1966 and his difficulties in obtaining accurate answers
                            and hard data. He suggests that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            death numbers were inflated by local Indonesians to demonstrate <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0378"/>their anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> sentiments to the new anti-Communist
                            authorities in Indonesia. Howland does make his own estimate. He recalls
                            that he received figures from a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army's Supreme
                            Operations Command's “Social Action Affair Section” which the military
                            man assured him were accurate from field reporting. Howland writes: “The
                            totals were 50,000 dead on Java; 6,000 dead on Bali; 3,000 in North
                            Sumatra. I was skeptical of his methods but accepted his estimates faux
                            de mieux, and combining them with my own data produces a figure of
                            105,000 Communist dead.” (Ibid., page 23)</p>

                        <p>545. 1. Following is our tentative analysis of developing situation in
                            Indonesia and implications for US. We very conscious you have most or
                            all of what follows in mind, but would like your comments and
                            observations in order to develop it into policy recommendations.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">In telegram 1304 from Djakarta, November 2,
                                the Embassy agreed with the general conclusions in this analysis,
                                although it stressed that the outcome of the continuing struggle
                                between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the
                                Army was not clear. On balance the Embassy believed the Army would
                                continue to exercise an important political role, but would make
                                concessions to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                because it needed him and because some Army leaders still revered
                                him. The Embassy anticipated a long, difficult political struggle.

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s speech October 25
                            and the openly declared campaign against <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> are first conclusive
                            evidence that Army leaders are determined make all-out fight against
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and its fellow-travelers, and
                            will not be deflected from this purpose by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s opposition.</p>
                        <p>3. Army leaders are increasingly asserting themselves against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Their game appears be to
                            separate him from his anti-Army advisers; isolate him; and then use him,
                            or possibly dispose of him, as situation requires. Seems inconceivable,
                            at this stage, they can afford let initiative slip from their hands back
                            to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> in headlong retreat in face of
                            mass attacks encouraged by Army. However, at some stage <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will reconstitute some of their forces
                            and fight back—by strikes, sabotage, or guerrilla action, against <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0379"/>background of propaganda that
                            Army is reactionary tool of imperialist powers and C.I.A. Army will have
                            no choice except meet this counterattack and will need more or less
                            coherent government to back up their efforts.</p>
                        <p>5. Army has traditionally maintained that its role is non-political and
                            has shied away from any idea taking power or sharing direct
                            responsibility for governing. But appalling fact in Indonesia, with
                            collapse <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> concept, is that
                            there is no organized or disciplined force capable of providing
                            leadership and direction to successor government, except Army. Unless
                            Army accepts the responsibility for taking lead in new government,
                            however unready or unwilling it may be, there will be anarchy in
                            government, further economic chaos, and Army will be handicapped in
                            meeting the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> challenge. Sooner or
                            later, and probably sooner, it will become increasingly clear to Army
                            leaders they are only force capable of creating order in Indonesia, and
                            that they must take initiative to form a military or civilian-military
                            provisional government, with or without <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The Army is already making top policy decisions
                            independently of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            is more and more acting as de facto government.</p>
                        <p>6. Relations with Red China are increasingly strained, and given the
                            suspicion of Army leaders that Chinese Communists were behind the coup,
                            and the course Army must take—i.e., destruction of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>—a break with China cannot be ruled out.
                            The Soviet Union has begun to exert pressure on Army to call off its
                            campaign against the left, even hinting aid would be cut off. Army
                            cannot capitulate to this pressure without endangering its whole
                            position.</p>
                        <p>7. If foregoing analysis correct, we can begin see shape of some problems
                            that may be posed for us:</p>
                        <p>a. As the Army begins to think in terms of new government, they may move
                            toward military junta, a civil government, or a military-civil
                            coalition. If our views are sought, any doubts they may have should be
                            resolved by encouraging them to form a civil-military coalition, on
                            grounds that their presence in government as a unified and disciplined
                            force is essential in at least early stages, to stability of such a
                            government, to campaign against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, to
                            economic reform, and to plotting Indonesia's new course independent of
                            outside influence.</p>
                        <p>b. Chinese Communist open hostility toward Indonesian Army bound to
                            increase as Army moves against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.
                            Soviets are in somewhat different position, since they blame Peiping for
                            aborted coup, but they will also be embarrassed as Army engages the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. If they support the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> against the Army, they will put strain
                            on their relations, but they cannot support Army. They will probably
                            take nebulous and opportunist position. Both China and Russia are
                            probably hoping <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> can
                                <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0380"/>still reestablish his
                            control and force Army to accept “purged” leftist party in a
                            reconstituted <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. If our assumption correct that Army must carry on its campaign against
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> will react, and that China and Russia cannot ignore
                            Army's destruction of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and may
                            criticize it—in fact they are already doing this—then Army will be
                            forced to examine its attitude toward China and Russia.</p>
                        <p>d. From there it is only one step for Army to conclude that they must
                            look elsewhere for friends and support. We can expect they will approach
                            Japanese, other powers, and, no doubt, us. They will need little
                            education in fact that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s
                            extreme foreign and domestic policies have isolated Indonesia and led
                            Indonesia to brink of economic, political and social chaos. But given
                            warped <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> thinking to
                            which they have been exposed for so long, they will be less certain what
                            to do about all this and fearful or suspicious of our advice and
                            assistance. The Indonesian Army leaders' close service-to-service
                            relations with our military provide important channel of influence.</p>
                        <p>8. The next few days, weeks or months may offer unprecedented
                            opportunities for us to begin to influence people and events, as the
                            military begin to understand problems and dilemmas in which they find
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>a. We should try to fortify their confidence that Indonesia can be saved
                            from chaos, and that Army is main instrument for saving it.</p>
                        <p>b. We should get across that Indonesia and Army have real friends who are
                            ready to help.</p>
                        <p>c. When asked for help by <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> we should respond by saying we are ready to
                            help as they begin tackling their problems in sensible way.</p>
                        <p>d. They will need food, and we can point out that the International Red
                            Cross can supply it, if they find direct help from us or others
                            embarrassing. (Japan, Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, and even the
                            Republic of Korea have rice.) Raw materials and spare parts for
                            machinery may be needed soon.</p>
                        <p>e. Indonesia's currency and credit chaos needs immediate expert
                            attention. We can point out that <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> can
                            provide advice and that <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and
                            Indonesia's real friends can provide assistance. But this will require
                            change in recent attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            and toward friends.</p>
                        <p>f. Small arms and equipment may be needed to deal with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. (Would the Soviet Union supply Army
                            with equipment so long as it is attacking <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>?)</p>
                        <p>g. As events develop, the Army may find itself in major military campaign
                            against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, and we must be ready for
                            that contingency.</p>
                        <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0381"/>
                        <p>h. <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> requirements may give us opening
                            to suggest a de facto moratorium on nationalization of oil industry so
                            as permit companies to give all-out support to Army's and the country's
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>9. It may well be that Army will turn to Japanese in first instance.
                            Japan can play notable part in this evolution toward more rational
                            Indonesia. Japanese have a vital national interest in success of Army's
                            campaign against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and in a stable and
                            independent Indonesia. The Japanese are already taking initiative. (See
                            Djakarta's 1238.)<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Dated October 28. (Ibid.,
                                    <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> 1 INDON)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. For the moment Japan is still hypnotized by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as the “essential” man and
                            they are being careful not to antagonize him. But if events move in
                            direction we have indicated, and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is isolated or removed, very different situation
                            will present itself to Japanese. At some stage we must have quiet
                            discussions with Japanese, compare notes on developments, and work out
                            with them agreed lines of action. The time for that may well be not long
                            after <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> is removed.
                            We shall, of course, want to consult with British, Australians, and
                            others as well.</p>

                            Director of the State Department's Office of Southwest Pacific Affairs,
                            called a meeting to discuss measures that might be taken to prepare for
                            an insurgency situation in Indonesia. Present were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName>, his deputy Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UFTJ1">Underhill</persName>, State's Indonesian <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0382"/>desk officer Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHK1">Goodspeed</persName>, Mr. [name not declassified]

                        <p>The current situation in Indonesia was discussed briefly and it was
                            agreed that there has been a sufficient deterioration in the security of
                            central Java to warrant contingency planning in Washington of how the
                            United States might aid the Indonesian Army if it requested our
                            assistance. A joint State-Defense cable to Embassy Djakarta was
                            finalized, asking for the Embassy's estimate of what items of equipment
                            and other materials the Indonesian Army might need if armed insurgency
                            should develop suddenly.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Telegram 544 to

                            Java might be considerably worse than reported thus far by the Embassy
                            and that the Army might have difficulty coping with large-scale
                            Communist insurgency. It is apparent that the Army's greatest deficiency
                            is in short-range communications equipment to support sustained
                            operations against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> guerrilla
                            operations. Longer range communications equipment, between islands and
                            perhaps also with other countries, may also be required if large-scale
                            warfare breaks out. As <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> no longer has
                            a military officer in Indonesia with communications expertise, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            is sending a specialist in this field to review the communications
                            situation with U.S. Mission officers (he will not talk to Indonesians)
                            and his report should help clarify the Indonesian Army's needs in this
                            field.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that for the moment, at least, the Indonesian Army probably
                            has most of the equipment it needs to deal effectively with any <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> insurgency. What the U.S. might be
                            requested to supply would be small quantities of specific items which
                            are in short supply or in a poor state of repair. We would probably be
                            requested to channel delivery of such items through a third country,
                            such as Thailand or the Philippines. Therefore, it was agreed that we
                            should not plan in terms of a resumption of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> but rather a covert plan of assistance in which <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would work [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] to insure the minimum
                            risk of exposure. If the amount of equipment turns out to be more costly
                            than [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was requested to determine
                            quietly what stocks of communications equipment and other items that
                            might be requested by the Indonesian Army are available in Thailand and
                            what would be the means of getting it quickly in response to an urgent
                            request.</p>
                        <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>The working group will meet again on November 3. It is expected that a
                            reply to the joint State-Defense message as well as a report from the

                            will then be possible to plan more precisely for the types of equipment
                            and other materials that the Indonesian Army may need to meet a serious

                        <p>2. At same time, we remain in the dark regarding army's future planning
                            and capabilities on a broad range of issues and until we know more about
                            their intentions and capabilities it would be hazardous to be drawn into
                            any extensive assistance to military. (This problem was subject of
                            Embtel 1271.)<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">In telegram 1271 from
                                Djakarta, October 30, the Embassy suggested establishing informal
                                contact with a key figure in the military, not from the top
                                leadership for reasons of conspicuousness, but someone who was close
                                to the “so-called Army Braintrust” led by General <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>. (National Archives and

                        <p>3. On one hand, we have to bear in mind army leadership continues to
                            knock US policies and play the same old tired records against <gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss>s. Confrontation continues and
                            Indo military evidently feel that any concession in our direction (e.g.
                            our oil properties) would be politically damaging. Hence there seems to
                            be little prospect of break-through on a range of major issues of
                            interest to US at least in near future.</p>
                        <p>4. On other hand, we have seen important changes past month that could
                            foreshadow further major gains from our viewpoint. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> seems at long last to have
                            been spurred to act on and, in tandem with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and other [tough?] deeply motivated military
                            leaders, is moving relentlessly to exterminate <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as far as that is possible to do. Military and police
                            here face precarious situation, outcome of which means much to free
                            world and where we clearly have a stake. US, along with other
                            like-minded countries, including Japan, have good reason to lend a
                            helping hand to the extent that that help is really needed and to the
                            extent that that help does not compromise army or detract from our
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>5. If this Embassy, through its various channels, can establish fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> is acting at behest
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, then I believe we should do
                            what we can as soon as we can, to meet request for medical supplies.
                            Cost is not prohibitive and quantity is such that both financing and
                            shipping could probably be handled covertly. In the event that word were
                            to leak out, adverse reaction would be largely mitigated by humanitarian
                            nature of material provided.</p>
                        <p>6. As to request for communications equipment, we could tell army that we
                            would give sympathetic consideration to providing certain types of
                            equipment in reasonable quantity but that we would have to have a more
                            explicit statement of army's needs and of purpose to which equipment is
                            to be put before we can proceed. (Presume we would want to consult with
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australians on all of
                            foregoing.)</p>
                        <p>7. As to provision of small arms I would be leery about telling army we
                            are in position to provide same, although we should act, not close our
                            minds to this possibility. There is a chance that situation in central
                            Java might take such a turn for the worse that we would wish to move
                            quickly with packages of certain types of arms. Mean- while, we could
                            explore availability of small arms stocks, preferable of non-US origin,
                            which could be obtained without any overt US Government involvement. We
                            might also examine channels through which we could, if necessary,
                            provide covert assistance to army for purchase of weapons.</p>
                        <p>8. As for providing rice, I note that <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> does not specifically ask our assistance in
                            this regard. He is merely explaining problem and <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0385"/>stating his intentions. Our view on

                        <p>1. We share your view reflected para 1 Ref A that <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> approach [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] surrounded
                            by complex of unanswered question relevant to our continuing
                            relationships with Indonesian Army. We have now established contact with
                            Army [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] but, as you bring out in Ref D, political contact
                            through <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> to senior
                            officer under <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> would
                            close third side of triangle providing essential perspective on Army's
                            program and intentions.</p>
                        <p>2. Before we become involved in furnishing assistance, we will want to
                            establish through this political channel basic framework our relations
                            with the Army as distinct from Indonesian Government. Secondly, will
                            want to set up single reliable channel through which requests <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0386"/>for aid would be submitted.
                            Finally, we must bring home to Army that while we want to be helpful,
                            our ability to be of assistance will depend in turn on the ability of
                            the Army to influence Indonesia's foreign and domestic policies that
                            have put so great a strain on our relations.</p>
                        <p>3. Concur that you proceed immediately to check through your contacts to

                            wishes. At same time suggest you proceed with effort establish discreet
                            link at political level as proposed para 5 Ref D.</p>
                        <p>4. Following thoughts, in addition to questions noted Ref A, suggested by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> approach:</p>
                        <p>A. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            Does <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> not have reliable
                            subordinate in Djakarta whom he trusts?</p>
                        <p>B. Request for medicines, which not considered of sufficient priority
                            this year to warrant allocation foreign exchange, appears somewhat
                            calculated effort appeal American sympathies. Parenthetically, we find
                            it curious that funds available for Martidinata aero-commanders, but not
                            for medicines.</p>
                        <p>5. While <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> has placed
                            November 3 deadline on response his request we are disposed proceed
                            cautiously. Your reporting thus far indicates no other element urgency
                            and for time being we are disposed give him temporizing reply that his
                            request is under consideration. We are proceeding analysis and costing
                            of medical request so that we can move rapidly if situation
                            warrants.</p>

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> has noted that
                            we are now dealing with two Indonesian governments. The first is the
                            established, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-led <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0387"/>Dwikora Cabinet. The second is
                            the Indonesian military. There is evidence that the Indonesians see a
                            somewhat comparable split image when they look at the United States, and
                            this memorandum presents an estimate of the Indonesian Army's view of
                            the American Government.</p>
                        <p>2. The Indonesian Army sees itself as dealing with three American
                            governments. With some over-simplification for the purpose of rough
                            identification, they may be described as the Pentagon, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the State Department. Recognition
                            of the separate military, intelligence, and political aspects of the
                            American governmental structure is not in itself remarkable. What is
                            striking is the degree to which the Army feels it can keep its
                            relationships with each in separate compartments, and deal with each on
                            a separate plane in isolation from the other two.</p>
                        <p>3. The relationship with the Pentagon is a friendly, professional
                            association developed at Ft. Leavenworth, Fort Benning and Fort Sam
                            Houston. It is a service-to-service tie between military men which
                            transcends political differences between the governments. It is an
                            association founded on trust, respect, and a network of deep personal
                            friendships.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">11 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>5. The Army's relations with State have not been extensive. The Army has
                            in the past regarded this manifestation of the American Government as
                            the proper province of the civilian branch of the Indonesian Government.
                            While not regarded as hostile to the Army as such, State is identified
                            in the Army mind with policies and actions inimicable to Indonesia's
                            basic national objectives.</p>
                        <p>6. The Army knows that all three United States governments approve of its
                            actions against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, and that all
                            three are disposed to help the Army in this effort. The basic problem
                            which now confronts it is how this American desire to help can best be
                            exploited, first in the interests of the Indonesian Army, and, second,
                            in the interest of Indonesia. (The Army naturally sees these two
                            objectives as almost identical.)</p>
                        <p>7. Help from the Pentagon, i.e., large amounts of arms and material in a
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> pattern, for the time being is
                            foreclosed because it cannot be concealed, and is therefore politically
                            unacceptable. Non-military assistance from State also could not be kept
                            covert and has therefore the same major political drawback. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>8. Looking beyond its current campaign against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, the Army is undoubtedly aware of the
                            problems it will have with State before any large-scale resumption of
                            American assistance is possible. Among these are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. The Army opposes western military presence in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0388"/>
                        <p>b. The Army favors continuation of confrontation. It may have some
                            differences with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> on tactics,
                            but not on basic policy. Confrontation provides a desirable unifying
                            influence. It provides a foreign enemy against which to channel popular
                            hostility. It provides a rationale for continuing sacrifices from the
                            civilian population and it justifies a continuing lion's share of the
                            budget for the military establishment.</p>
                        <p>c. The Army opposes our policy in Viet-Nam. It considers our military
                            presence as western intervention encouraging rather than deterring
                            Chinese intervention in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>d. The Army is strongly nationalistic in economic orientation, and favors
                            the takeover of western economic interests. We could be seriously
                            mistaken if we believe that the Army does not favor a takeover of the
                            American oil industries. It has undoubtedly calculated very carefully
                            the repercussions of such a takeover and may have already made careful
                            preparations with the Japanese and other powers to compensate for any
                            ill effects. Transportation and marketing would obviously be the main
                            problems confronting a national oil industry, and the Japanese are in a
                            position to help on both. The Army may be quite prepared to force
                            Stanvac and Caltex out, go ten or twenty cents per barrel below the
                            world market price in return for Japanese cooperation, and pocket the
                            remainder of the company's share of the profits. On this basis the Army
                            may calculate that Indonesia's foreign exchange position would be
                            improved rather than damaged by a takeover. From the political point of
                            view, such a strongly nationalistic action would be applauded by
                            virtually all Indonesians. It would cut the ground from under the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and establish the Army as a firm foe of
                                <gloss target="#t_NEKOLIM1">NEKOLIM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>e. The Army has a major stake in continuing good relations with the
                            Soviet Union. These relations, they feel, will probably survive the
                            current campaign against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, but
                            might suffer serious damage through any highly visible rapprochement
                            with the United States. The Army has a tremendous investment in Soviet
                            hardware, and without spare parts this hardware becomes a pile of junk.
                            The Army's prestige and its position as a major military force in
                            Southeast Asia depends on continued functioning of this equipment. The
                            Army must persuade the Soviet Union that it is anti-Chinese and that
                            despite its actions against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> it
                            will continue with policies that will serve Soviet interests in
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>9. If the foregoing analysis of the Army's position is valid, it has the
                            following implications for U.S. policy:</p>
                        <p>a. In the life and death struggle which has finally been joined with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, the Army deserves our
                            support.</p>
                        <p>b. For the time being we should accept the fact that the best we can hope
                            for is a more truly non-aligned Indonesian Government still <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0389"/>hostile to the United States in many
                            ways, but also hostile in many respects to the interests of both the
                            Soviet Union or Communist China.</p>
                        <p>c. For the time being we must accept a minor role in influencing the
                            course of Indonesian events. The United States has been too firmly
                            established as the enemy of Indonesian national hopes and ambitions to
                            permit Indonesian individuals and organizations to work publicly with
                            us. We can, however, play an important supporting role with the Japanese
                            and other acceptable foreign governments, and we have an obvious
                            contribution to make in selecting small-scale covert assistance.</p>
                        <p>d. With the passage of time a more truly non-aligned Indonesian
                            Government may gradually come to recognize that American and Indonesian
                            interests are in harmony and not in opposition. Under these
                            circumstances our investment in training of Army officers under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, and civilians under a variety of
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs will bear fruit. This
                            is, however, a process which must proceed at its own pace and any
                            well-meaning efforts to hurry it are likely to have the reverse
                            effect.</p>

                        <p>The second meeting of the Indonesia Working Group took place on 3
                            November in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName>'s office
                            at State. Present were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UFTJ1">Underhill</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GHK1">Goodspeed</persName> from State; Mr. Friedman and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDE1">Nuechterlein</persName> from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>; Mr. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        <p>The major subject for discussion was the request of General <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>'s apparent emissary, for
                            medical supplies, tactical communications equipment, rice and possibly
                            small arms to assist the Army in dealing with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> dissidence during the next few months. As <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s request was [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                                <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0390"/>stated in somewhat vague
                            terms, State has queried Embassy Djakarta in order to determine whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> is acting with full
                            support from General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            and if so, whether the Embassy believes that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should agree to financing all or part of this limited
                                assistance.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> At the time of the meeting, no reply
                            had been received from Djakarta. Neither had there been any reply to the
                            Joint State-Defense request of October 29 asking for an appraisal of the
                            kind of military assistance that might be requested by the Army in case
                            of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> insurgency.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">See <ref target="#d164fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    164</ref>.</note> There was considerable discussion over whether
                            it was in the interest of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to
                            make limited medical, economic and military assistance available to the
                            Indonesian Army without conditions. State is of the view that Sukendro's
                            request for assistance was an opening wedge designed to find out how
                            willing the United States is to grant aid and on what conditions. State
                            therefore believes that before committing itself to aiding the
                            Indonesian Army, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should have a
                            better idea than it presently does of what future Army policies are
                            likely to be. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and the White House
                            Staff believe that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should not
                            attach conditions initially because they feel it is important to assure
                            the Army of our full support of its efforts to crush the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, which is the basis of Sukendro's
                            request. It was decided [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> should be advised his request is being
                            considered in Washington. If we determine from Djakarta that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> supports <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s request, we will then decide
                            what items should be made available and the extent to which the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will pay for them.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the desirability of consulting at a
                            high level with the Japanese Government to enlist its support for a
                            policy of aiding the Indonesian Army. One problem is that the Japanese
                            prefer to work with a government headed by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and it is not certain at
                            this point whether <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            will eventually be persuaded to work with the Army against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. However, the Japanese show signs of
                            disenchantment with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            leadership, and it may be possible to get their support for an aid
                            program that would support the Army's position. State will look into the
                            possibility of a high-level approach to the Japanese Government. The
                            meeting also agreed that it might be desirable at some point to bring
                            the Thai Government into the picture, in view of its good relations with
                            Indonesia and because it could serve as transit point for assistance we
                            might wish to give the Indonesian Army.</p>

                            has alerted its contacts to report any increase in commercial shipping
                            headed for Indonesia that might be carrying arms to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. This information will be made
                            available to Embassy Djakarta for possible transmittal to the Indonesian
                            Army. There is no requirement as yet for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to augment surveillance over shipping in the vicinity
                            of Indonesia; but this may be desirable if the security situation in
                            Java becomes critical.</p>
                        <p>Another meeting of the Working Group is scheduled for November 10.

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> saw contact mentioned reftel in
                            informal, easy-to-talk setting and achieved some clarification on army's
                            thinking about current problems as well as being able plant idea that
                            dialogue between this Embassy and someone close to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> on future political, economic
                            and foreign problems and policies of Indonesia would be useful to both
                            sides. Emerging from discussion were following salient points:</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, not <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, is one who gives orders,
                            conceives his own strategy and faces <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> directly. But he and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> are close, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> advises him, and there is
                            general understanding that they will not permit wedge to be driven
                            between them as happened in case <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Yani. Source said, “We are saving <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> for later.”</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> probed at some length to discover
                            whether there any civilian political figures especially close to army
                            with whom it would be useful to discuss future. If there are any
                            civilian political figures working closely with army now, other than
                            some of Cabinet ministers in their respective fields, it is being
                            carefully concealed. Only name source proposed as civilian spokesman
                            close to army was Suwito. He said Suwito had been completely
                            disillusioned about Subandrio. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> said
                            his experience with Suwito had not shown latter to have very friendly or
                            cooperative attitude towards Americans but we of course glad to talk to
                            anyone army felt they could trust.</p>
                        <p>4. In Central Java army (<gloss target="#t_RPKAD1">RPKAD</gloss>) is
                            training Moslem youth and supplying them with weapons and will keep them
                            out in front against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Army will try
                            to avoid as much as it can safely do so direct confrontation with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. With top <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leadership most of whom
                            are in Djakarta, army is avoiding frontal attack. While carefully
                            limiting their freedom of action and movement, army is letting groups
                            other than army discredit them and demand their punishment, and awaiting
                            developments. Smaller fry being systematically arrested and jailed or
                            executed.</p>
                        <p>6. Similarly indirect tactic being used with Subandrio. Army discussed
                            removing him but decided against frontal attack, instead is keeping in
                            background and letting other groups attack and slowly demolish
                            Subandrio's image. It requires more time to do it this way but it runs
                            less risk of alienating <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> from army.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> recently had a three
                            hour discussion with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            trying to convince <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            that firm measures army taking against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> correct and necessary. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> appears to have been convinced (another
                            well-informed source told <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> same thing
                            evening of Nov. 3) that Suharto should have his support. Both these
                            sources believe that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            now accepts <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, mainly
                            however in sense of force majeure. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                            asked source whether <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            had really accepted <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            approach or was merely pretending to do so. Source said he wasn't
                            sure.</p>
                        <p>8. With reference to solicitation of aid, <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> alone speaks for <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            now. Procurement of rice particularly is exclusively concern of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>. Rice is not to be
                            procured by private entrepreneurs.</p>
                        <p>9. Although <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is moving
                            slowly and as much as possible through parties and mass movements in
                            Djakarta and much of Java, <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0393"/>in
                            outer islands local military commanders have free hand to take direct
                            action against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and they are doing
                            so.</p>
                        <p>10. Army confident it can break back of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> attempted insurgency before it get[s] too serious.</p>
                        <p>11. Army is not thinking purely in military terms or intending turn
                            political future of Indonesia over to civilian elements. Army is moving
                            its people into all aspects of government and organizational framework
                            with view keeping control on political trends and events.</p>
                        <p>12. Atmosphere of sloganeering aimed at West generally and US
                            particularly would be subject to gradual change but it could not be done
                            all at once. (<gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> has made strong point
                            that there would have to be drastic change in this atmosphere before it
                            would be possible for US representatives to work effectively with army
                            or other Indonesians.)</p>
                        <p>13. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> made clear that Embassy and
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> generally sympathetic with and
                            admiring of what army doing. We felt it essential that we not get
                            involved in any way in present struggle fearing to do [so] would
                            handicap effort army making. We thought it would be well, however, if we
                            could find some way to carry on dialogue with someone or preferable more
                            than one, including civilians, as close as possible to thinking of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Objective would be to lay
                            foundation of understanding between us. This would involve no commitment
                            by either side but would make it easier for us to act effectively if at
                            some future date army should want help from US. There were problems
                            between US and Indonesia which, if not handled in context good
                            understanding between us could grow to proportions which would make it
                            harder rather than easier for us to help Indonesia if in future
                            assistance of any kind desired. One such problem was position American
                            oil companies. Source, who is among most articulate and comprehending of
                            Indonesian Army officers in English, indicated understanding and said he
                            would think it over, consult with his colleagues and be in touch with
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> later.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> makes following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>A. On basis this conversation <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is much more important political as well as
                            military figure in fact as well as in minds of those around him than
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, at least previously thought. It
                            is also reflected in other evidence that at least in minds public
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is more and more
                            emerging as strong man in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>B. Although this is highly speculative, it seemed implied that there is
                            longer term as well as short term army strategy (army, probably wisely,
                            is saying as little about that as possible) which involves plan to make
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> candidate for the
                            top position after <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>C. Implication of saving Nasution for later (para 2 above) seems to mean
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> will assert carefully
                            applied army pressure and <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0394"/>control government but will not, if he can avoid it, take over in name
                            so long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is
                            alive.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> speculates that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> strategy is for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> to activate and instill confidence in Moslem
                            elements. But not to bring Moslem leaders into limelight now. In the
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> may well play
                            leading political role with Moslem support. People like Hatta, Adam
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and others, whom we know
                            CAS and other reports are in contact with army leaders, also probably
                            being saved for post <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            era.</p>
                        <p>E. In typically Indonesian, if not Javanese fashion <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> strategy calls for extreme
                            patience and slow moving time framework. It will require an equally
                            patient approach on part of US if at any point we are to mesh our
                            efforts with army's. Army being very careful not to move too fast,
                            probably out of concern for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> but also because it is Indonesian way.</p>
                        <p>F. Not much thought has apparently been given yet to what army's
                            conception of future relations with US are to be, or army is for moment
                            keeping that carefully concealed.</p>
                        <p>15. We believe we have planted seed that may lead to useful political
                            dialogue with army and we think we should continue to cultivate this
                            garden being careful, however, not to overwork soil around still
                            delicate plant constructive potential for us in Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>1. In view assurances reftel re <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s role, agree we should proceed to process
                            request for medical supplies, both because request explicitly made and
                            because medical supplies relatively innocuous if fact of our assistance
                            surfaced.</p>
                        <p>2. We are looking separately into question of communications equipment

                                not declassified</hi>], prefer to keep this subject in

                            discussed with <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>. If he
                            raises it, we would, however, like to know more precisely what he has in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>3. We do not have specific request from <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> for anything else. Apart from medical supplies,
                            what he has done to date is to give us general outline of supply problem
                            which Army faces and general outline his prospective shopping list.
                            Since other questions such as supply of arms would present us with
                            additional serious problems not involved in medical supplies issue, we
                            do not wish to pursue subject with <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> for the present.</p>
                        <p>4. We understand <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> still in
                            Bangkok. Mission should approach him through established channel and
                            tell him following:</p>
                        <p>A. We are willing to act on his request for medical supplies, and are now
                            reviewing list in terms availabilities, locations, means of covert
                            purchase and pricing. We are having trouble with some items on list <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0396"/>which we cannot identify by
                            nomenclature given, and would like keep in touch with <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> or someone he designates for
                            clarification. If <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> wishes
                            to handle personally, we would like to know where he will be in next few
                            days so that list of questioned items can be sent to him.</p>
                        <p>B. When we have completed study of package we will communicate again with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and will inform him
                            re size of package and any large discrepancy in time of availability of
                            component parts. In meantime we would like <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s views as to preferred method and place of
                            delivery.</p>
                        <p>5. In delivering foregoing message would like to be sure our
                            representative does not speculate about possibility favorable action any
                            further items other than to indicate our general willingness to consider
                            Army requests for small-scale covert assistance. Representative should
                            also tell Sukendro that we will be glad to talk to him outside Indonesia
                            about limited covert assistance, but that before Washington can consider
                            any substantial assistance it will need to know more about Army's
                            political views and intentions and Army's attitude toward US- Indonesian
                            relations. Representative should add that in order obtain this
                            information he understands we are attempting to set up political contact
                            with Indonesian Army in Djakarta through our <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>.</p>

                            departure for Rangoon. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>
                            was obviously pleased with the favorable response to his request on
                            behalf of the Indonesian Army leadership. There ensued a discussion of
                            the covert arrangements to be made for the Indonesian Army's obstensible
                            purchase of the medicines and a review of the medical list by <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s doctor, a Col. (Dr.) Achmad

                            reported in CAS channels.</p>
                        <p>2. Although the guidance contained in the referenced messages was
                            strictly adhered to, <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>
                            specifically stated the Indonesian Army leadership does desire to pursue
                            further in subsequent discussion here the possibility of covert limited
                            provision of weapons and communications equipment. General <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> specifically asked, and it was
                            felt unwise to question the propriety of his request, that there be
                            further discussion in Bangkok on possible covert provision of additional
                            limited covert assistance to the Indonesian Army.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> advised that Col.
                            Firmansjah is to arrive in Bangkok early next week. He stated the
                            Colonel is being sent here to dis- cuss the Indonesian Army small arms
                            requirement. (This had earlier been approached by Sukendro as reported
                            para 5, CAS Bangkok 0256<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">Not found.</note>
                            and presumably has reference to para 4, Ref C.) He further stated police
                            Colonel Soebianto is scheduled to arrive by the beginning of the week
                            with the list of communications equipment needed by the army. There was
                            no discussion of the planned arrival of these officers nor any
                            discussion relative to assistance for the pro- vision of communications
                            equipment or weapons. It was felt best not to be drawn into a discussion
                            of what we could or could not consider in terms of support beyond that
                            presently approved. It was additionally believed unwise to attempt to
                            discuss the propriety of further substantive discussions here in view of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s repeated
                            statements that the army wishes to handle these matters here on a covert
                            basis and security circumstances in Djakarta are not in their opinion
                            conducive to working out details inherent in the provision of such
                            support.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> will be returning from
                            Rangoon on either 6 or 8 November in view of information which he had
                            just received from his advance party in Rangoon to the effect that there
                            is no additional rice available for export from Rangoon beyond that
                            already committed for next year.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s apparent
                            intention to pursue further the possibility of U.S. Government covert

                            youths in Central Java for use against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, we necessarily need more explicit guidance as to how

                            particularly important in view of <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s early return to Bangkok and the fact that he
                            will perforce be here for a very short period of time within which the
                            basic arrangements will apparently need be made before his departure for
                            Cairo. His present schedule will require his departure on about 10 or 11
                            November for Cairo. He stated that he plans to leave his senior aide
                            here to work out the implementing details of any mutually agreed

                            army's political views, intentions and attitudes toward Indonesian-U.S.
                            relations the following impinges on this subject. When substance of
                            guidance contained in para 5, Ref B conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> he responded by stating that
                            he fully appreciates the U.S. concern and need to have the earliest
                            possible exposition of Indonesian Army policy on these subjects. He made
                            it clear however that any discussion on this matter would in his opinion
                            necessarily be academic at this point; that the army must of necessity
                            first succeed in eliminating the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and all
                            others in positions of leadership and authority who are responsible for
                            the present Indonesian policy. He stated that until and unless the army
                            succeeds in this, it is not possible to change or openly advocate a
                            change in Indonesian foreign policy. He stated there is no question as
                            to the army's desire to normalize relations and this will follow
                            naturally and automatically with the elimination of these elements.
                            Sukendro stated that he and others of his group have discussed their
                            hopes and plans for Indonesia so often in the past and they are
                            embarrassed to discuss this now in view of their obvious inability to
                            take those actions.<note n="7" xml:id="d171fn7">In telegram 1353 from

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The requests of the Indonesian military leaders for covert assistance
                            in their struggle against the Partai Kommunis Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>), create a definite risk for us of
                            deliberate assistance to a group which cannot be considered a legal
                            government nor yet a regime of proven reliability or longevity. Early
                            assessment of the political direction and longevity of this military
                            leadership must be accomplished and, before any overt or readily visible
                            assistance could be offered, its legal authority as well as its de facto
                            control must be confirmed explicitly. As long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> fights a clever rear-guard
                            delaying action politically, this is not likely soon to occur.</p>
                        <p>2. On the other hand, the Army leaders appear determined to seize the
                            opportunity of the current confused circumstances to break the
                            organizational back of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, to
                            eliminate it as an effective political force, and to prevent emergence
                            of any crypto-Communist successor party. Recent intelligence from within
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> party ranks clearly indicates
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has begun to abandon hope
                            of salvation through <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s political legerdemain and has therefore decided it
                            must, however ill-prepared and disorganized, fight back against the
                            Army. Despite the overwhelming military superiority of the Armed Forces,
                            the roots of Communism, of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            membership, and of mass support nurtured for years by the constant flood
                            of pro-Communist media, are so deep in many areas that the Army is very
                            likely to be faced with a lingering insurgency situation. Specifically,
                            much of Central Java is in very poor shape. Hard intelligence on the
                            area shows a sizeable potential for resistance, and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> sources indicate plans for a redoubt
                            area there. Considering the economic problems Army leaders will face as
                            they gradually assume more and more authority under their own program
                            for a non-Communist future, the law of rising expectations is against
                            them; they cannot divert popular attention from economic ills as
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has for many
                            years, and the weight of several years neglect of economic problems and
                            realities may fall upon them. Therefore if the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> can build even small areas of resistance in Central
                            Java and West Sumatra, they will have the ideal bases from which to
                            mount campaigns of harassment, subversion and sabotage as the emergent
                                <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0400"/>non-Communist government
                            attempts to grapple with responsibilities already close to
                            overpowering.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition, the Army must find some formula for continuing its
                            relationship with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in
                            a way that will retain real control for themselves without necessitating
                            a preemptive hostile move against Sukarno which might cause him to defy
                            or deny them, and thus provoke divisions in their own ranks. In this
                            insurgency situation therefore, the Army has no real guarantee of
                            ultimate success; hazards to its survival are many and varied.</p>
                        <p>4. One of the Army's major needs will be civilian support. They have
                            instituted psychological warfare mechanisms, control of media
                            prerequisite to influencing public opinion and have harassed or halted
                            Communist output. They have also mobilized certain bases of mass
                            support, especially among Moslems. Unfortunately in these areas where
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has been able to initiate an
                            insurgent campaign or local resistance, as in Central Java, the Army has
                            not been able to protect those anti-Communist civilians who have fought
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and pro-Communist rebel troops.
                            If this situation continues, the populace in some of these areas may be
                            intimidated from affording aid to the government forces regardless of
                            their convictions, or they will be decimated.</p>
                        <p>5. True, the future policy of the Indonesian Army if it should succeed in
                            controlling or eliminating <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as an effective factor is not entirely clear.
                            Two probabilities do however seem fairly significant about its future
                            stance:</p>
                        <p>a. It will certainly be less oriented towards Asian Communist Bloc and
                            will be decidedly Nationalist (though not without some Marxist and
                            anti-Western concepts), perhaps with a strong neutralist flavor and
                            hopefully with a concentration upon Indonesia's internal welfare.</p>
                        <p>b. Its future attitude regarding the West and the U.S. in particular will
                            certainly be affected favorably by the degree to which the U.S. can now
                            provide what limited aid the military leaders feel they require in their
                            struggle to survive.</p>
                        <p>6. In short, we must be mindful that in the past years we have often
                            wondered when and if the Indonesian Army would ever move to halt the
                            erosion of non-Communist political strength in Indonesia. Now that it
                            has seized upon the fortuitous opportunity afforded by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s error in the 30 September affair and
                            is asking for covert help as well as understanding to accomplish that
                            very task, we should avoid being too cynical about its motives and its
                            self-interest, or too hesitant about the propriety of extending such
                            assistance provided we can do so covertly, in a manner which will not
                            embarrass them or embarrass our government.</p>
                        <p>7. In reviewing the types of assistance which can be provided covertly,
                            we believe that mechanisms exist or can be diverted or created <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0401"/>to extend either covert credits
                            for purchases or to deliver any of the types of the materiel requested
                            to date in reasonable quantities. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] The same can be said of
                            purchasers and transfer agents for such items as small arms, medicine
                            and other items requested. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] wherein we can permit the Indonesians with whom
                            we are dealing to make desired purchases and even indicate to them where
                            items may be purchased without our being in on the direct transaction.
                            Some degree of control can be exercised through these accounts to insure
                            that the letters of credit cannot be misused for other than specified
                            purposes. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] which can be made available on very short notice.
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] equipment would be more expensive and would
                            require a little more time to deliver. It would however probably be more
                            appropriate if equipment is to be handed by Indonesian Army officers to
                            selected civilian auxiliaries.</p>
                        <p>8. We do not propose that the Indonesian Army be furnished such equipment
                            at this time. This should be determined only after exhaustive
                            conversations with Sukendro and his associates and, to the extent
                            securely feasible, with Nasution's subordinates at Djakarta. In these we
                            would probe for necessary details, e.g., precisely why they need
                            additional arms, how they intend to use them, to whom they intend to
                            give them, how they intend to control the release and registration of
                            weapons and to control the groups who receive them, and many other
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>9. If the Indonesian Army leadership continues to insist to us that they
                            need this type of assistance to crush the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, and even if they furnish the above details, we would
                            still be incurring political risk and the possible risk of loose
                            handling of the arms in satisfying the request. These risks, however,
                            must be weighed against the greater risks that failure to provide such
                            aid which the Army claims it needs to win over the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> might result in reduction of the Army's
                            future political position and concomitant erosion of what may be a
                            unique opportunity to ensure a better future for U.S. interests in
                            Indonesia. It is difficult to predict definitively that aid of this type
                            is absolutely vital to that future. If the Army leaders justify their
                            needs in detail, however, it is likely that at least will help ensure
                            their success and provide the basis for future collaboration with the
                            U.S. The means for covert implementation, either of transmittal of funds
                            for necessary purchases or delivery of the requested items themselves in
                            discreet fashion, are within our capabilities.</p>

                            being made with <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s
                            designee—Col. (Dr.) Achmad Soemantri. As earlier noted Soemantri has
                            been ordered by Sukendro to remain in Bangkok to act as his liaison
                            officer to work out the details for the covert implementation of medical
                            agreement. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> continues, of
                            course, to be quite pleased with the expeditious and favorable responses
                            to the Indonesian Army's request for covert medical assistance. He
                            stated he has reported to Generals <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that arrangements were being made for the early
                            delivery of the requested medicines. He has additionally reported in his
                            capacity as head of the purchasing mission to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on the arrangements for the
                            purchase of rice and medicines. Naturally the latter report is on the
                            basis of this being a straight commercial transaction negotiated by his
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> again referred to the
                            army's urgent need for communications equipment. He specifically
                            requested that arrangements be made for the covert procurement and
                            provision to the Indonesian army of a limited amount of commercially
                            available communications equipment. He noted that the army while hoping
                            and working for the best must nevertheless be prepared for the worst.
                            Despite that which has been accomplished in the past five-six weeks in
                            crushing the PCD, he believes the army has a long way to go.</p>
                        <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> identified essentially
                            three basic communications requirements. He cited two as being
                            particularly urgent and requested US Government covert assistance in
                            bridging what the army considers a serious communications gap. He stated
                            the senior army leaders in the Djakarta area have no voice radio
                            communications facilities. The army leaders need portable voice
                            equipment to provide communications from one to the other and to perhaps
                            two of the military units in the Djakarta area. They have in mind
                            perhaps a dozen sets which would be assigned to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, Umar, <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and other senior military leaders plus the Para
                            Commando Unit and possibly one of the guard battalions in the
                            metropolitan area.</p>
                        <p>5. The second requirement specifically identified by <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> as a significant gap in
                            Indonesian army communications has to do with the establishment of an
                            army voice circuit based in Djakarta and connecting the army commands at
                            Medan, Palembang, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Makassar and
                            Bandjermasin. Security conditions permitting, they will probably want to
                            position another set at Jogdjakarta and possibly one other principal
                            command location. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> noted
                            the army has no long range voice communication net. The intent here is
                            to establish a controlled quick-reaction emergency backup to the
                            existing army <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> system and commercial
                            telephone and telegraph. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>
                            stated the deficiencies in voice communications equipment available to
                            the army has been further aggravated by destruction of communications
                            equipment in the course of the 30 September incident and subsequent
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>6. He stated the army's experiences since 30 September have made them
                            acutely aware of the inadequacies of the communications facilities
                            presently available to them. The senior army leaders feel particularly
                            exposed by their lack of voice communications for their personal
                            protection, particularly in the Djakarta area. Hence the request in para
                            4 above. They believe in a fast moving, fluid situation such as they are
                            now confronted with, their ability to talk immediately to the commander
                            on the spot could be of tremendous assistance. In emergencies they
                            recognized that time often does not permit the use of <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> and the telephone system is both
                            vulnerable and unreliable.</p>
                        <p>7. The third communications area of concern to the Indonesian Army
                            leadership is in the area of more effective communications on the
                            tactical unit level in the Central Java area. This problem is the
                            subject of a staff study by Col. Soebianto in Djakarta. Soebianto
                            however was not able to get to Bangkok prior to <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>'s departure. Sukendro did not
                            pursue this problem area other than to make passing reference. He
                            specifically identified their request for equipment as having to do with
                            the requirements set forth above. He neither stated nor implied that
                            there would be a subsequent request for support in addition to that
                            noted in the preceding paragraphs.</p>
                        <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0404"/>
                        <p>8. The army does not have funds available to purchase this equipment. If
                            the decision is made to accede to their request it will necessarily have
                            to be on the basis of covert procurement and delivery [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] from which
                            point <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> assures the army's
                            capability to receive and arrange onward movement to Indonesia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> stated this will not
                            present a problem for the army. Presupposing that the equipment is
                            sterile and commercially available the army does not believe this would
                            present a problem of security or potential embarrassment given the
                            requirements as identified above.</p>
                        <p>We suggest consideration might be given to the covert procurement of
                            commercially available stock items as set forth in our immediately

                            has carried relatively little on such violence, November 10 newspapers
                            carried account of “revolutionary youth” cornering and beating to death

                            attacks on U.S.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The purpose of this operational proposal is to assure that certain key
                            anti-Communist Indonesian Army leaders will have adequate communications
                            equipment for use in their fight against the Communist insurgents. Such
                            equipment is in insufficient supply in Indonesia. This lack has, in
                            consequence, imperiled the personal security of important anti-Communist
                            Army leaders and has jeopardized their effectiveness in combating the
                            Communists' efforts to eliminate non-Communist influence favorable to us
                            in their Government.</p>
                        <p>This request for equipment by several leading Indonesian officials has
                            the support of the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia and is concurred in by
                            the State Department's Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs.</p>
                        <p>There are some risks in the delivery of this equipment, but [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] with
                            proper precautions in making deliveries to the ultimate recipients will
                            minimize such risks. The Indonesians cannot now ostensibly nor actually
                            purchase this equipment in the U.S. without exception being made to U.S.
                            export license controls, thereby implying U.S. Government collusion. Any
                            exposure of this activity would embarrass not only the U.S. Government,
                            but certain <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0407"/>high Army officials
                            in the Indonesian Government. Much care will be taken in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>The cost of the requested equipment is approximately [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. The
                            supplies themselves come to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            ship.</p>
                        <p>On 5 November 1965 the 303 Committee approved a similar request to send
                            medical supplies to Indonesia.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="#d170fn1">footnote 1, Document 170</ref>.</note> This
                            operation is proceeding on an urgent basis. It is hoped that the 303
                            Committee will approve the above program, which it is expected will
                            proceed with the same urgency.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Problem</p>
                        <p>The immediate need is to provide on an urgent basis the present
                            Indonesian Army leadership with secure voice and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> communications. Such equipment will provide a continuity
                            of communications among the various Army units and their anti-Communist
                            leaders and between certain of these leaders and U.S. elements. Given
                            the uncertain loyalties within various Army commands and within Army
                            communications proponents, existing communications equipment cannot be
                            relied on to satisfy this need.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Factors Bearing on the Problem</p>
                        <p>On 13 October 1965, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] were furnished from [<hi rend="italic">less

                            and other key Army officers. The continuing insufficiency of this
                            equipment in the hands of leading anti-Communist Army leaders has
                            imperiled their own personal security and could make it difficult for
                            them in a crisis to communicate securely with each other and/or with the
                            U.S. A [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            October in conjunction with the Djakarta country team. The Indonesian
                            Army does not have funds to purchase the equipment but asks that it be
                            given to them covertly and as rapidly as possible.</p>

                        <p>The various requirements for communications equipment came [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            from the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, from the Minister of Defense

                        <p>On 5 November 1965 the 303 Committee approved an operational proposal for
                            Indonesia responding to a request for medical supplies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. Operational Objectives</p>
                        <p>A covert contact [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] must be maintained with certain Indonesian Army
                            leaders who also require additional means of communicating securely
                            among their own components in their struggle with the Communists. In the
                            confused situation of conflicting loyalties in the Indonesian scene
                            today, the security and personal safety of the leading anti-Communist
                            leaders and safety of their families from intimidation and kidnapping,
                            is of vital importance to their continuance of the struggle to prevent
                            any return to the status quo before the 30 September coup. The possible
                            assassination of <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, Umar or a number of
                            other generals would constitute serious setbacks for the U.S.
                            Furthermore, in order to coordinate planning with trusted subordinates,
                            they must have private communication facilities, frequently out of
                            direct channels, in order to be really secure. There is equipment
                            available within the Indonesian Army units for routine communications
                            but recent events have shown clearly that not everyone, even in high
                            ranks of the Indonesian Armed Forces, can be relied on to be loyal to,
                            or even sympathetic with, the desires of Nasution and Suharto to crush

                                were available, rather than the latest U.S. equipment. Colby agreed

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>A major source of instability in Southeast Asia has been Indonesia's
                            “confrontation” of Malaysia which began in early 1963. Following the
                            change of political climate in Djakarta, there has been speculation that
                                <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0410"/>the Indonesian army might
                            bring an end to confrontation. It is unlikely, however, that the army
                            because of the political liabilities involved and its own anti-Malaysia
                            orientation, is now ready to take such action. In the near future
                            military activity against Malaysia, already at a low level, should not
                            be significantly affected by the Indonesian upheaval.</p>
                        <p>1. Although there was a massive Indonesian buildup along the Borneo
                            border and in Sumatra, beginning last December and largely completed by
                            May, military activity directed against Malaysia has declined during the
                            past six months. With few exceptions, only routine patroling and minor
                            probing action has taken place along the Borneo border. The last
                            Indonesian attempt to infiltrate an armed guerrilla unit into the
                            Malayan peninsula occurred last March. Indonesian planning for
                            demolition sabotage against the Malayan peninsula has continued but
                            implementation has been limited. During the past two months there has
                            been only one explosion attributed to an Indonesian agent.</p>
                        <p>2. This lag in Indonesian activity has resulted in large part from the
                            almost total lack of success the Indonesians have had in their past
                            operations in Borneo and in the Malayan peninsula. In Borneo, effective
                            British cross-border operations have disrupted Indonesian planning and
                            have placed the approximately 17,000 Indonesian troops in the area on
                            the defensive. Since August 1963, when Indonesian infiltration attempts
                            against Malaya began, British and Malaysian security forces have
                            captured or killed over 500 of the nearly 700 Indonesian guerrillas
                            involved in these unsuccessful efforts.</p>
                        <p>3. Several recent reports have indicated that the Indonesian army now
                            intends to reach a modus vivendi with Malaysia. However, there is reason
                            to doubt whether the army favors an end to confrontation. While opposed
                            to many of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s internal
                            policies and his fostering of Communist influence, the army in the past
                            has accepted enthusiastically <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s expansionist policies and has apparently been
                            convinced that Malaysia is a British scheme aimed against Indonesia. A
                            good example of the army's somewhat naive international view is the
                            lingering and apparently sincere belief among the army leadership that
                            the British, as well as Communist China, played a role in instigating
                            the “30 September” plot against the army.</p>
                        <p>4. If the army eventually becomes the ruling force in Indonesia it will
                            inherit a number of pressing economic and social problems compounded by
                            the current unrest. In the past <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made use of foreign adventures and international
                            issues to divert attention from these problems. The army could
                            conceivably feel the need to borrow a page from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and re-emphasize
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>5. Even should the army want to end confrontation, it would be difficult
                            for it to move in this direction in the near future. After two years of
                            anti-Malaysian propaganda, the average Indonesian considers <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0411"/>confrontation a patriotic duty. Even a
                            hint of a conciliatory army position toward “neocolonialist” Malaysia
                            would give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> the
                            ammunition he needs to undermine the army's attempts to maintain its
                            present political initiative.</p>
                        <p>6. Although, for the above reasons, an early end to confrontation seems
                            unlikely, military activity against Malaysia is likely to remain at a
                            low ebb while the army is deeply involved in political maneuvering and
                            suppression of the Communist Party. The current level of confrontation
                            activity does not require the large numbers of troops now deployed
                            around the periphery of Malaysia. One brigade of troops has recently
                            been returned from the confrontation theater to the now critical areas
                            of Central and East Java, and other similar redeployments can be
                            expected.</p>
                        <p>7. Malaysian leaders, in recent statements, have indicated they have
                            little hope for a settlement with Indonesia in the near future. However,
                            a new generation of political leadership, more nationalistic,
                            parochially Malay and anti-Chinese in outlook, is now emerging in Kuala
                            Lumpur. If an Indonesia emerges in which Communist influence has been
                            muzzled, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been
                            ousted from real power and more moderate leadership prevails, Kuala
                            Lumpur, anxious to present a more “Afro-Asian” image, will be eager for
                            an accommodation with its “Malay brothers” to the south and might take
                            the lead in seeking a settlement.</p>
                        <p>8. The new nation of Singapore would look with disfavor upon a sudden
                            normalization of relations between Malaysia and Indonesia which would
                            also bring the elimination or reduction of British military presence in
                            the area. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, noting the current anti-Chinese
                            activity in Indonesia, has already expressed alarm over the prospects of
                            a Malay “encirclement” of Chinese Singapore.</p>

                        <p>1511. 1. We believe that US and allies should be extremely cautious about
                            offering help to General[s?] at this time. In any case, our help should
                            be contingent upon whether we believe army really intends to <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0412"/>remain firm against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>. There are conflicting
                            indications as to whether army will remain firm or whether it will bow
                            gradually to President's will. In view of Indo tendency to procrastinate
                            and avoid hard decisions, we should take care lest premature,
                            unconditional offers of assistance strengthen army tendency to avoid
                            facing issues. Above all we should not provide assistance that will
                            redound to benefit of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            who remains head of state and govt. At present time, army would seem to
                            be in general agreement with above approach (see Embtel 1479 reporting
                            my latest conversation with Saito).<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">Dated
                                November 17. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (JAPAN)

                        </p>
                        <p>2. At present there is conflicting evidence as to whether, when and how
                            army will move against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. As long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> retains power army and anti-Communist will
                            probably be inclined to maintain “anti-imperialist” and “anti-colonial”
                            policy which has corollaries of continued confrontation of Malaysia and
                            anti-Western posture generally (although viciousness of anti-US
                            propaganda may be reduced as long as army can continue to exercise
                            balance to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>). We also
                            forsee continued and probably increasing chaos as result of impasse
                            between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and army that
                            makes any kind of economic development program absurd unless and until
                            one or other is eliminated entirely as political force.</p>
                        <p>3. Although US prospects may be better in long run (post <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>), we do not forsee any
                            great improvement in US position in short run even if army can hold on
                            as half of sort of triumvirate power structure. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> counterattacks to regain
                            his former power (or, ultimately, even more) will undoubtedly make use
                            of anti-US themes. We have already seen evidence of this in President's
                            150 million rupiah charge.<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">In a speech to
                                the Cabinet on November 6, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> charged that former Ambassador to Indonesia

                                “certain Indonesian” 150 million rupiahs for the purpose of

                        </p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly, we recommend following line to be advanced at prospective
                            meeting (and as basic US position):</p>
                        <p>A. We take no steps that would enhance <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> image whether desired by Indo Army or not.</p>
                        <p>B. We should not provide any significant economic assistance to Indo Army
                            unless and until we know where they are going politically and
                            economically. (Carefully placed assistance which will help army cope
                            with <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> actions different.)</p>
                        <p>C. We should consider assistance to genuinely non-Communist government if
                            there is altered atmosphere in which such assistance could be
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>D. In discussing requests for assistance with Indo groups or third
                            countries, we would do well to mention <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s condemnation of <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0413"/>US aid and unfounded charges of US subversion, as well
                            as lack of evidence that Indonesia prepared to make most effective use
                            of outside assistance.</p>

                                V, 10/65–11/65 and Vol. VI, 11/65–5/66)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. For six weeks the Indonesian Army has been engaged in a major campaign
                            against the Communist Party of Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). Party members and sympathizers are being rounded up
                            and interned by the military; others are being purged from local
                            government positions; and in Central Java <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> adherents are reported to be shot on sight by the army.
                            The army has risked much of its prestige and political future on this
                            campaign. It wants to ban the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and to
                            cripple the party permanently, but its attitude toward Marxism is far
                            more complicated than simple anti-Communism.</p>
                        <p>2. The army has a long record of opposition to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as a political force. In addition, some
                            army leaders undoubtedly view Communism as an ideology which is
                            essentially evil, totalitarian, and alien to the “Indonesian way of
                            life.” But this view is by no means universal. Army officers and
                            enlisted personnel, like Indonesians in all other walks of life, have
                            for the past several years been subjected to a fairly constant barrage
                            of pro-Communist propaganda. This propaganda, echoed and often initiated
                            by President Sukarno, has had its effect. While some <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0414"/>army officers' beliefs are firmly
                            rooted in a fundamentalist and essentially anti-Communist Moslem
                            tradition, many others, particularly in the lower ranks, equally firmly
                            consider themselves to be Marxist socialists. Nearly all army leaders,
                            however, are united in regarding the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            as a rival for power within Indonesia. They are at present engaged in a
                            power struggle, not an ideological struggle, with the party.</p>
                        <p>3. A well-placed army source recently told the US Embassy that the army
                            was anti-Chinese and anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, but not
                            anti-Communist. This is a good capsule summary of the military's
                            position, for clearly a large segment of the army is by no means opposed
                            to Marxism per se. Indeed, officially the army gives full assent to the
                            frequently stated proposition that the Indonesian revolution is a
                            socialist revolution. Probably few army leaders would oppose some sort
                            of state-controlled Marxist party, even one calling itself Communist, if
                            this party were clearly nationalistic—that is, wholly oriented toward
                            Indonesian national interests. The Yugoslav model is instructive in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>4. The army leadership at present finds itself opposed to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> on a variety of grounds. First, the
                            murder of a number of high-ranking officers in the course of the
                            insurrection on 1 October has made it clear to the army leadership that
                            its very survival may be at stake in the present struggle. Second, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, with its high degree of
                            political motivation and discipline, has developed an independent power
                            structure that is not necessarily responsive to the organs of
                            government. Finally, the army believes the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s ties to Peking make it in effect the agent of a
                            foreign power. For all these reasons the army finds the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> a threat to its own power position. But
                            it also finds in these factors useful arguments in the propaganda war it
                            is now waging against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. It is
                            claiming the party is out of phase with Indonesian ideals and a
                            “traitor” to the Indonesian revolution, and is emphasizing Chinese
                            Communist involvement in the 1 October uprising. This last argument is
                            particularly effective, given the Indonesians' general antipathy to the
                            numerous Chinese merchants living in their midst.</p>
                        <p>5. In pressing this campaign against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, however, the army has had to tread a delicate path
                            with respect to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who is not only emotionally committed to
                            Marxism, but is also convinced that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, with its high degree of discipline, is a unifying
                            factor on the Indonesian political scene, where centrifugal forces have
                            plagued the government from its inception. In addition, the army must
                            consider Moscow's attitude. The Indonesian military establishment is
                            almost totally Soviet-supplied, and the army is well aware of its
                            dependence on the Soviet Union for spare parts, replacements, and
                            ammunition.</p>
                        <p>6. Whatever its feelings about Peking, the army certainly wants no break
                            with Moscow. It has been careful to exclude the Soviet Union <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0415"/>from its recent denunciations of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and of the Chinese Communists. A
                            recent report suggests that Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has worked out an
                            understanding with the Soviets whereby Soviet arms would continue to
                            reach Indonesia while the army attempted to eradicate pro-Chinese
                            influence within the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is said to have promised that
                            Indonesia would adopt neither a policy of hostility to Communism as an
                            ideology at home nor to the Soviet Union and its satellites in
                            international affairs. Such an understanding, either formal or informal,
                            seems likely, although it is probable that the Soviets would also be
                            willing to assure <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            that relations with Indonesia would remain firm should he, rather than
                            the army, emerge the victor in the present tug-of-war.</p>
                        <p>7. Moscow has been playing the recent events in Indonesia in a low key in
                            its current propaganda. It has been making the minimum noises necessary
                            when Communist Party members are being harried and shot by government
                            forces—criticism far milder, for example, than that directed at Iraq in
                            1963 when similar conditions obtained in that country. Arms deliveries
                            have continued to reach Indonesia without interruption over the past six
                            weeks. There is no indication that they will be cut off.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is reported to have
                            told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of his
                            arrangement with the Soviets. He undoubtedly hopes to cut the ground
                            from under any potential <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> allegation that the army, in its anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> campaign, is exhibiting reactionary
                            tendencies and is tied to “neocolonialism.” The army leaders may also
                            feel that continued evidence of Soviet good will, as expressed in
                            uninterrupted arms shipments, may infuriate the Chinese Communists and
                            lead to recriminations that the army could then use to advantage in its
                            attempt to orient Indonesia away from Peking.</p>
                        <p>9. The embassy suggests that in reaching an understanding with the
                            Soviets on the arms shipment question the army may leave itself open to
                            Soviet pressure to resuscitate the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            along pro-Moscow lines. While this is possible, it is by no means
                            likely. The army would not be happy at the appearance of a revivified
                            Communist Party with strong ties to a foreign power, even if this power
                            were Moscow rather than Peking. Furthermore, it is likely that the
                            Soviets themselves do not particularly wish to become entangled in the
                            thickets of Indonesian politics. They have before them the clear example
                            of Peking's involvement in this manner—an involvement which has led to a
                            diminution of Chinese influence in Indonesia. Moscow is primarily
                            interested in close government-to-government relations with the
                            Indonesians, and may well feel that its virtual arms-supply monopoly
                            affords it greater influence on Indonesian policies than would a
                            Moscow-oriented <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, which the army may
                            at some future date come to consider to be as great <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0416"/>a threat to it as it does the present
                            party. Government-to-government relations supplemented by the leverage
                            of continued arms shipments and the training of middle-grade Indonesian
                            officers in the USSR, gives the Soviets the same sort of influence they
                            enjoy in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>10. Indeed, even the rehabilitation of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as a “national Communist party” would prove difficult
                            in present circumstances. While the army might have no ideological
                            difficulties in accepting such a party, it has the present <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> on the run and almost certainly would
                            like to destroy the party's organizational structure while it has the
                            chance. It has made no attempt to cultivate the less militant element of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> that might be expected to form
                            the core of a new party. In practice it has made no distinction between
                            those elements directly involved in the 1 October insurrection and other
                            “safer” party members when making arrests and purging local government
                            machinery. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, like other
                            traditional Communist parties, is organized from the top down, and its
                            members are inclined to follow the lead of its constituted leadership.
                            These leaders have international considerations as well as Indonesian
                            interests in mind, and if forced underground would probably take a large
                            portion of the more dedicated rank-and-file with them. On the other
                            hand, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has a strong nationalist
                            coloration, and some lower level party members may eventually be induced
                            to join a tame, government-organized and sponsored party professing
                            Marxism. The army would, however, attempt to see that such a party did
                            not have a real voice in governmental policy making.</p>
                        <p>11. Even a development along this line, however, presupposes a victory
                            for the army in its present attempt to influence <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to accept its view of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as a threat to the Indonesian
                            state. This outcome is by no means certain; the army may yet be
                            outmaneuvered by the politically astute President. In the end, the army
                            may be forced by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to
                            acquiesce in a rehabilitation of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, or to accept the party almost whole but reconstituted
                            under a different name. For that which worries the army most—the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>'s tight organizational structure—is
                            precisely what makes it so attractive to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. And while it is true that the army has gone
                            further in present circumstances in pursuing its own ends, it has
                            retreated in the face of presidential pressure before and may do so
                            again.</p>
                        <p>12. Whatever the outcome of the present scramble for power, it is
                            unlikely that there will be a major change in Indonesian foreign policy.
                            Should the army emerge on top, Indonesian policies would probably be
                            more genuinely neutral in balancing between East and West, and the
                            tendency to follow Peking's lead in international affairs certainly
                            would be reduced. However, no break with Moscow is in the cards, and the
                            army would find it difficult to extricate itself from present foreign
                            policy attitudes to reach a genuine rapprochement with the <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0417"/>West. In part this is true because the
                            army itself believes these policies to be correct, and in part because
                            to reach an accommodation with the West would expose the army leaders to
                            charges of “selling out to the neocolonialists” from leftist Indonesian
                            elements independent of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.
                            Specifically, the army is deeply involved in confrontation with Malaysia
                            and, despite some indications that its leaders are having second
                            thoughts about this policy, it is unlikely that they can stand down on
                            confrontation without a considerable loss of face. Furthermore, the army
                            leadership, like <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            would probably find confrontation a useful symbol around which to unify
                            the many divisive forces at work in the archipelago.</p>

                        <p>1. This is to confirm my earlier concurrence that we provide Malik with
                            fifty million rupiahs requested by him for the activities of the
                            Kap-Gestapu movement. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>2. The Kap-Gestapu activities to date have been important factor in the
                            army's program, and judging from results, I would say highly successful.
                            This army-inspired but civilian-staffed action group is still carrying
                            burden of current repressive efforts targeted against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, particularly in Central Java.</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> is not in charge of the
                            Kap-Gestapu movement. He is, however, one of the key civilian advisers
                            and promoters of the movement. There is no doubt whatsoever that
                            Kap-Gestapu's activity is fully <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0418"/>consonant with and coordinated by the army. We have had substantial
                            intelligence reporting to support this.</p>
                        <p>B. I view this contribution as a means of enhancing <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s position within the movement. As
                            one of the key civilians, he is responsible for finding funds to finance
                            its activities. Without our contribution Kap-Gestapu will of course
                            continue. On the other hand, there is no doubt that they need money. The
                            latter, despite inflation, is in tight supply, and the comparatively
                            small sum proposed will help considerably.</p>
                        <p>C. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            Our willingness to assist him in this manner will, I think, represent in
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s mind our endorsement
                            of his present role in the army's anti-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> efforts, and will promote good cooperating relations
                            between him and army.</p>
                        <p>D. The chances of detection or subsequent revelation of our support in
                            this instance are as minimal as any black bag operation can be. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                            short paper suggesting alternative methods for providing medicines and

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> said that as a result
                            of his reading of the conversations with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] he had come to the
                            conclusion that the Department and perhaps <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> too had been “conned” into taking on this project. It
                            was perfectly obvious that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> knew nothing of the financial arrangements that
                            were to have been made as cover for the project, despite the
                            Department's insistence that he be advised. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had sent <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> out to get medicine, but
                            hadn't given him any money. Did this mean that Sukarno was merely trying
                            to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and had no
                            idea that the latter would take his supposed mission seriously? There
                            was also the possibility that this whole project was a provocation.
                            Instead of considering alternative methods of getting medicines to the
                            Indonesian Army, what we ought to be considering was how to drop the
                            project. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> attempted to
                            counter all of these assertions, but was hampered <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0420"/>somewhat by necessity of arguing on
                            policy rather than on intelligence grounds. He cited a number of times
                            our need to show the Indonesian Army that we supported them in their
                            campaign against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. In addition, the Army really needed the medicines.
                            We didn't know but what a civil war was in the offing in Indonesia. The
                            Indonesians needed to know who their friends were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName> said it was quite
                            obvious that the Indonesian Government could scrape up a half million
                            dollars easily if they really believed the medicines were necessary. He
                            cited the fact that the Indonesian Navy was buying two Aero Commander
                            planes at a cost of 575 thousand dollars, and that DC–8s which would
                            cost 50 million dollars were also on order.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> found
                            support from unexpected quarters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName>, backed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName>, argued the necessity of indicating approval in
                            a practical way of the actions of the Indonesian Army. The [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            that the medicines would cost was a mere pittance compared with the
                            advantages that might accrue to the US as a result of “getting in on the
                            ground floor.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJCJ1">Thomson</persName> added
                            that he believed that the request by <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> offered us an unparalleled opportunity to give
                            an earnest of our intentions toward an Indonesia in which a moderate
                            army leadership held the balance of power.</p>

                        <p>After considerable further discussion it was agreed on suggestion of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CDC1">Cuthell</persName> that we probably had
                            to go through with this project only because it had gone beyond recall.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> insisted, however,
                            that nothing further be done until [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] a detailed step-by-step plan
                            for covering the extension of the line of credit [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], and had submitted
                            that plan for the Department's approval. Indicating that there was some
                            urgency about getting the matter settled, since [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] was shuttling
                            about various European capitals with considerable rapidity, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> said that such a plan
                            would be presented to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>
                            within the week.<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">This was done in a

                            matter and relay it to State, (State's outgoing instruction was not
                            discussed with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>). I am inclined to
                            think that emergency assistance to help the Indonesian Army consolidate
                            its position should be granted promptly when and if a bona fide request
                            is made by the Army leadership. Such short-term aid should be considered
                            separately from long-term economic assistance and should not be
                            conditional upon a commitment to end confrontation and to suspend plans
                            to negotiate the withdrawal of American oil firms. Although covert
                            financing probably is too risky, it should be possible to get the
                            Indonesian Army's agreement on some method of handling this transaction
                            that would not embarrass the leadership if it becomes known.</p>
                        <p>The real question, it seems to me, is whether the Army requires this rice
                            to win its struggle for power with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, or whether it can cement its authority without
                            our help. If our assistance is essential and is requested by the Army
                            leadership, I think we should give it without strings. If the Army
                            emerges on top politically, which now seems likely, we will get many
                            requests for large scale assistance. That will be the time to talk about
                            a change in Indonesian foreign policy and other conditions on our aid.

                        <p>The question of the role the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia in compiling and
                            providing lists of Partai Komunis Indonesia (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) members to anti-Communists and Indonesian military
                            authorities has been the subject of controversy. In 1990 a journalist
                            interviewed <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Robert J. Martens</persName>,
                            political officer in the Embassy, and then published an article, “U.S.
                            Officials' Lists Aided Indonesia Bloodbath in 60's.” (<hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi>, May 21, 1990) <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> sent a letter to the editor of The <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> on June 2, 1990, in which he
                            stated: “It is true that I passed names of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders and senior cadre system to non-Communist forces
                            during the six months of chaos between the so-called coup and the
                            ultimate downfall of Sukarno.” <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> continued, “the real point, however, is that the
                            names I gave were based entirely—I repeat entirely—on the Indonesia
                            Communist press and were available to everyone. This was a senior cadre
                            system of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>—a few thousand at most
                            out of the 3.5 million claimed party members.” <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> stressed that these lists of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> members were “not party rank and
                            file.” <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> also stated
                            categorically in his letter that, “I and I alone decided to pass those
                            'lists' to the non-Communist forces. I neither sought nor was given
                            permission to do so by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall
                                Green</persName> or any other embassy official.” Martens concluded
                            with the statement that he did not turn over classified information nor
                            was he the head of an Embassy group that spent 2 years compiling the
                            lists as stated in the article in <hi rend="italic">The Washington
                                Post</hi>. He stated that there was no such group.</p>
                        <p>Between December 17, 1965, and August 10, 1966, the Embassy sent the

                            members. On December 17, 1965, the U.S. Embassy in Djakarta transmitted
                            to the Department airgram A–398 that contained as enclosures lists of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leadership and a compilation on
                            the fate of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders. The airgram was
                            drafted by <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> who informed
                            the Department that the Embassy had received a <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0425"/>number of reports concerning the
                            arrests of prominent <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders, often
                            based on suspect evidence. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> also cautioned that there was widespread
                            falsification of documents, such as “alleged confessions some of which
                            can be easily detected and some not.” He then explained that enclosed in
                            the airgram were two lists. The first was an unclassified list of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leadership bodies (Politburo,
                            Central Committee, Central Control Commission, Central Verification
                            Commission, and Secretariat Central Committee-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) with the names of their members as they existed in May
                            1965. The second enclosure was a “fragmentary compilation on the present
                            whereabouts of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders based on
                            limited information available.” The May 1965 list contained 95 <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> positions (comprising only 67
                            individuals since <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> members often had
                            multiple positions and one official was identified by two different
                            names). The second list described the whereabouts of 18 <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders of which all but 2 were either
                            dead, arrested, or believed to be arrested. (National Archives and

                        <p>On March 11, 1966, the Embassy sent the Department airgram A–564 which
                            was drafted by <persName corresp="#p_MRJ5">Martens</persName> and signed
                            by <persName>Edward</persName> Masters and contained as an enclosure an

                            from the Central Committee, Central Control Commission, Central
                            Verification Commission and Heads of Provincial <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> Organizations who were not members of the Central
                            Committee. The airgram indicated that information on <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> officials “remains extremely
                            fragmentary but sufficient additional information has been received to
                            make a new compilation advisable.” The enclosure was a list of 80 <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders and their status. (Ibid., RG
                            84, Djakarta Embassy Files: Lot 69 F 42, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>On August 10, 1966, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> sent airgram A–74 to the Department, drafted by
                            Marten and approved by Masters, which provided as an enclosure another
                            update of the fate of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders.
                            Airgram A–74 provided new information available since March 1966 on 15
                            senior <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> figures and listed 4 senior

                            reported imprisoned. This airgram, which was signed by <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, indicated that: “A sanitized [ie.

                        <p>1. Indo politics has continued to move in “right” direction since our
                            last assessment (reftels). <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is no
                            longer a significant political force, and Djakarta-Peking axis is in
                            tatters. Meanwhile, army has gained in political experience and has
                            further consolidated its position. Most notable change, however, has
                            been further weakening of Sukarno's prestige and marked failure of his
                            mid-November bid to get full authority back in his own hands. This
                            failure has opened real possibility of far-reaching changes in local
                            power structure during next few months, but many problems and hazards
                            remain.</p>
                        <p>2. Indonesia is now in midst of basic political revolution. Final
                            outlines this revolution still obscure, and there will almost certainly
                            be slippage from time to time, but we do not believe Sukarno/Subandrio
                            can reverse present trend. Following significant developments underlie
                            this interpretation:</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s image is
                            tarnished. From all sides we hear comment that he will no longer be
                            decisive political factor in future. Even newspaper editorials and
                            corner columns are beginning to snipe at his hitherto sacred image.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s dogged
                            adherence to his discredited slogans and in particular to his insistence
                            on continuing Communist role in Indo society and Indo alliance with
                            Asian Communist regimes has furthered public disillusion. Meanwhile army
                            leaders and others are ignoring his admonitions to extent which
                            inconceivable three months ago.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has been
                            stripped of much of his authority. Even though earlier army hope to
                            force him out before now has not materialized, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has lost ground. His
                            intelligence agency (<gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss>) has been taken
                            out of his hands and placed under army-dominated supreme operations
                            command (<gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>). He has been smoothly
                            eliminated from top leadership position in <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss> at time when that body apparently <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0427"/>being groomed as real power center.
                            Even within Foreign Ministry, there large faction headed by his first
                            deputy (<persName corresp="#p_SK1">Suwito</persName>) which not loyal to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>C. KOTI has developed into potential rival government. Existing cabinet
                            (105 portfolios) must eventually be changed into more efficient
                            governmental tool. Appointment of <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, Sultan Hamengku Buwon, and Ruslan Abdulgani as
                            Deputy Supreme Commanders of <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>, with
                            authority over military, economic, and political affairs, seems first
                            step in this process and virtually creates rival to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s presidium and cabinet.
                            Below the three <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss> deputies command
                            structures are being created reaching into every sphere of governmental
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>D. Army's internal position is stronger. Military cohesion has tightened
                            to extent <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> can now expect loyalty most key
                            commanders in any showdown. Efforts by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to shunt aside anti-Communist military leaders
                            have flopped, and army has retained effective urban as well as rural
                            control despite indications month ago that control might be slipping in
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>E. Moderates seem about to regain control of Nationalist Party (8).
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> support for
                            party's radical left wing has had little effect in saving Ali/Surachman
                            leadership. This further evidence of major shift in locus of power which
                            has taken place.</p>
                        <p>F. Old foreign policy has been discredited. Indonesia's close alignment
                            with Communist China is shattered. Even confrontation with Malaysia is
                            beginning to respond to new atmosphere and we aware of as little support
                            outside immediate <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            entourage for lengthy pursuit of this ill-conceived policy.</p>
                        <p>G. Indos are starting to do normal business with us again. It is apparent
                            that high level decision has been made to clean up old problems between
                            FonDep and Embassy. Yesterday Embassy received payment for damage to
                            Medan and Surabaya Consulates by demonstrators earlier this year. This
                            first reimbursement we have received since 1962. We also informed
                            yesterday that private property of two Embassy military officers which
                            seized when house they rented from William Palmer taken over early this
                            year will be returned to us, ending nine months of bickering. This
                            morning <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> books which held in
                            storage since March were turned over to Ministry of Higher Education for
                            use by Indo universities.</p>
                        <p>3. Indo political change not yet complete, however, and old government
                            structure still stands in way of positive actions in some fields. Major
                            problem for army is fact it still saddled with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Army obviously not happy
                            with what he says and does but still reluctant to take any direct action
                            to remove him. It thus possible he will remain head of state although we
                            do not believe he will regain dominant political role. In any event, we
                            as well as army may as well face fact we may have to live with him for a
                            while.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>4. Even if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains, we
                            believe odds are that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> will go and that locus of power will center
                            more and more on army and civilians cooperating with it. While such
                            government will have number of shortcomings (particularly in skilled
                            personnel), and while it will face problems of staggering proportions,
                            at least it likely to be government with which we can deal realistically
                            on matters of common concern. Whether such government will be able in
                            long run to maintain its authority and prevent fragmentation of control
                            over these scattered islands will depend in large measure on whether
                            army able to maintain momentum which is sweeping it to power and show
                            concrete results in handling enormous economic and administrative
                            problems. Continuing elimination of Communists in most areas and attacks
                            on Chinese in some have definitely weakened public order and this is
                            another of many problems which army will have to tackle. For time being,
                            however, attacks on tattered remnants of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> are being allowed to continue, although purely racial
                            excesses against Chinese are being held in partial check.</p>
                        <p>5. As we approach 1966, we are primarily still remaining as far in the
                            background the Indonesian scene as possible, but on near horizon is
                            necessity to be prepared to work with a new order which will still
                            contain many problems for us but will be infinitely more healthy and
                            more promising than what we had before Oct 1.</p>

                            information indicating that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might be re- moved <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0429"/>from power after 1 January 1966 and Indonesia may
                            request US aid.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">Telegram 1797 from Djakarta,
                                December 15. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

                                INDON) In telegram 1924 from Djakarta, December 30, the Embassy
                                suggested that although dissatisfaction with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had increased, opinions
                                differed on whether he would be ousted in the near future. The
                                Embassy stated that “on balance we believe Army would prefer not to
                                oust <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at this time
                                unless their hand is forced, most likely by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself.”

                        <p>2. (S) Should this occur followed by an Army takeover, requests for overt
                            economic assistance—especially for foodstuffs—may be substantial.
                            Requests for the overt provision of military materiel probably would not
                            be large. Items which might be requested include ammunition,
                            man-portable radios, light automatic weapons, vehicles, and perhaps
                            C–130 and C–47 aircraft spares. Some training assistance might also be
                            sought.</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The displacement of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> by the Indonesian Army could benefit US security
                            interests in the area. While political philosophies within the Army
                            cover the full spectrum of those existing in Indonesia, the Army as a
                            whole appears to be searching for a nonaligned policy which runs counter
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            previous alignment as a junior partner of the ChiComs. The Army appears
                            to be the strongest single anticommunist force in the country but will
                            eventually call for civilian leadership which, in turn, probably will
                            represent a nationalist-religious-communist coalition. The US interests
                            would be best served if the government which follows President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s removal were to be
                            pro-Western. It is more likely that it would be neutralist. In any case,
                            opportunities to influence the course of events will be presented to the
                            United States and it is appropriate to investigate at this time ways in
                            which they can be exploited to US advantage.</p>
                        <p>4. (S) There are several factors, however, which impinge upon the
                            advisability of immediate overt provision of military aid to the
                            Indonesian Army by the United States:</p>
                        <p>a. The position of the Indonesian Army is precarious and any overt
                            provision of US military aid at this time could tend to reinforce
                            charges by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, Peiping, and Moscow
                            that the Army is a “tool of (US) imperialism.”</p>
                        <p>b. Without a demonstrated willingness on the part of Indonesia to
                            discontinue the “crush Malaysia” policy, the United States could be in a
                            position of subsidizing Indonesian aggression and opposing US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interests in the area. On the other hand,
                            relaxation and eventual elimination of the confrontation with Malaysia
                            would reduce the cost to the United Kingdom of maintaining military
                            commitments in Malaysia <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0430"/>and
                            Singapore and could lead to advantageous economic relations among
                            Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.</p>
                        <p>c. Problems concerning expropriation of US economic assets, subversive
                            intent toward the Philippines, and recognition of international law in
                            the matter of free passage of the sea straits between Indonesian islands
                            all require resolution.</p>
                        <p>d. Considering present US commitments in Southeast Asia, the logistics
                            implications of aid to Indonesia must be evaluated.</p>
                        <p>e. In view of Indonesia's past tendency to export aggression, the impact
                            on neighboring countries of aid to Indonesia should be considered.</p>
                        <p>5. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The United States, if requested, be prepared to provide Indonesia a
                            limited quantity of emergency foodstuffs/medicines in the interest of
                            showing support for the new government.</p>
                        <p>b. Since the campaign of the Indonesian military leaders against the
                            Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) appears
                            to be progressing according to plan and no US military assistance
                            appears required for internal security, the United States should not
                            overtly provide military aid to Indonesia at this time.</p>
                        <p>c. Prior to giving favorable consideration to additional requests for
                            overt aid, the problem areas outlined in paragraph 4, above, must be
                            substantially resolved.</p>
                        <p>d. The Department of State and the Department of Defense jointly
                            establish criteria for the resumption of overt military and economic
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>e. A memorandum substantially as contained in the Appendix hereto be

                                assistance for the Army from western countries. Helmi suggested that
                                300,000 to 350,000 tons of rice, 50 million yards of cotton cloth,
                                and medical supplies were needed to prevent friction within the Army
                                ranks and disillusion among the general public. Helmi estimated the
                                cost at $50 million and suggested that western donors share the
                                burden. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> recommended
                                telling Helmi that he (<persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>)

                                question of aid and at least give them assurances that emergency aid
                                would be forthcoming when the time was right. (National Archives and

                            himself shifting ground and recommending that he be allowed to tell the

                            <persName>Marshall</persName> is a quick study; he's also the man on the
                            spot. So perhaps we should use his views as a lever to move our
                            reluctant <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> friends.</p>
                        <p>It's also worrisome to me when we do nothing but discourage the Japs,
                            Germans, and others who come in to ask whether they should now
                            contemplate aid. It's one thing to say that we think it too soon to talk
                            of aid, but quite another to avoid even indicating that if things
                            continue to go well we would probably change our tune.</p>

                        <p>1. Suggest <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> reply to Helmi along
                            following lines: We wish to convey to Helmi and through him to Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> two basic interrelated and
                            inseparable thoughts:</p>
                        <p>a. The US continues to be interested in the welfare, progress and
                            independence of the Indonesian people and is prepared assist <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in its efforts achieve these
                            objectives, and</p>
                        <p>b. Only the Government of Indonesia can create the conditions in which it
                            is possible for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to play this
                            role.</p>
                        <p>2. The lack of favorable response to Helmi's previous overtures is not
                            due to any negative attitude or lack of friendship or sympathy, but
                            rather to fact that Indonesia has not yet created situation in which the
                            US can be of assistance to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>3. Following are major elements still missing:</p>
                        <p>a. In regard both emergency and development aid, we must be sure we are
                            dealing with cohesive and effective <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            which can and will use it effectively.</p>
                        <p>b. We can only deal openly and publicly with Indonesian Government on
                            matter of aid. It is impossible for a democratic country such as the US,
                            responsible to Congress and to its people, to give substantial
                            assistance covertly.</p>
                        <p>c. Cooperation with Indonesia has never been conditioned on US–<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> agreement on all issues, but US people
                            could not give, nor Indonesian people accept, assistance when the US is
                            being publicly identified by highest <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            officials as arch enemy of Indonesian people.</p>
                        <p>4. Under these circumstances US can do nothing but wait. Initiative is in
                            Indonesian hands not in our own.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We do not wish Helmi, nor through
                            him <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, to get idea US assistance
                            merely awaits green light from Army leadership. Process of basic
                            political and economic change begun in weeks following October 1 with
                            elimination <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has slowed down. (It is
                            significant Helmi-<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> now see
                            substantial aid from West given to a <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>

                            prepared accept aid as act of grace.) There is presently no evidence
                            that assurance of <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0433"/>US and other
                            foreign assistance would accelerate and not retard changes which

                        <p>2204. 1. Following message summarizes some personal opinions as to course
                            of events in Indonesia and implications for US policy.</p>
                        <p>2. During first three weeks of December army scored considerable gains in
                            its power struggle with the palace. During this period a prestigious
                            triumvirate was named to direct <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>
                            (top policy and coordination body) with expanded powers, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> was under heavy
                            challenge, his intelligence branch (<gloss target="#t_BPI1">BPI</gloss>)
                            was reported to have been transferred to control of <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss>, KOTOE was abolished, Gestapu trials
                            were announced, and left-wing political groups were being driven more
                            and <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0434"/>more to cover. A number of
                            specific though small irritants in US-Indo relations were removed. By
                            the end of the month there were rumors, some emanating from well
                            informed sources, to effect that major shifts expected in January which
                            would also see departure of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for extended trip abroad.</p>
                        <p>3. January, however, was marked by a number of set-backs for the army's
                            position and by a recrudescence and regrouping of palace forces. In
                            retrospect it appears that important showdown occurred at conclusion of
                            three-day <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss> session on December 18
                            when President apparently refused to ban <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and reasserted all his old positions. Up to that point
                            army leadership had been operating on wishful theory that President
                            could be brought into line on such key issues as banning the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and reorganizing government structure
                            to give due attention to mounting economic crisis. However, his views
                            were set forth in such uncompromising terms during crucial <gloss target="#t_KOTI1">KOTI</gloss> session December 16–18 that all
                            present realized he was not going to concede one inch. Question arose:
                            What should the army and moderates now do? There followed a short period
                            of indecision with majority of army group, led by <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, favoring no action to
                            confront President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            directly and decisively. Their unwillingness to tackle <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may have reflected concern
                            as to loyalty of rank and file in the military were army to find itself
                            in open opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Army may also have rationalized that since
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his clique
                            refused to cooperate willingly it might be better tactic to leave them
                            in power and let them bear full responsibility for economic
                            deterioration.</p>
                        <p>4. When it became revealed to President in late December that army was
                            unwilling to take any concerted action against him, he saw wider scope
                            for his operations.</p>
                        <p>5. Public reaction during first two weeks of [garble—January?] to high
                            prices on rice, kerosene, transportation, etc. permitted the army to
                            move behind public opinion and encourage students to take to streets
                            denouncing <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s monuments and other
                            things offensive to army and moderates. This agitation culminated on
                            January 15 when thousands of students tried to storm gates of Bogor
                            Palace, requiring <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            personal appearance before them to urge restraint. President was obliged
                            to promise that his economic ministers would review the situation to see
                            whether prices could be lowered.</p>
                        <p>6. Bogor Palace episode seems to have shocked the army, as much as
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, re serious
                            consequences which army would face were these disorders to get out of
                            hand as they almost did. Thereafter army and President were genuinely
                            united in a resolve to prevent further disorders and to crack down on
                            students, Moslems, and others who might go to extremes. Army made its
                            position clear to these various groups.</p>
                        <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0435"/>
                        <p>7. Net effect of recent events has been to discourage some of army's
                            civilian allies and give <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> additional leeway to maneuver. Moderate
                            political leaders tend increasingly to regard army as untrustworthy ally
                            that is willing to push civilian groups to fore but deserts them when
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> attacks. This
                            attitude will reduce army's ability to use such groups later.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been operating
                            on the theory, I believe, that the longer he can delay his political
                            solution the better chance he has of being able to accelerate
                            realization of his cherished goals of <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CONEFO1">CONEFO</gloss>.
                            Possibly he feels that to announce such a solution today would invite
                            more serious risks of counter action than to make such an announcement,
                            say, two months from now when further divisions amongst the army,
                            parties, religious and youth groups would have weakened his opposition.
                            Moreover, uncertainty over political solution may feed policy
                            differences within army itself. As long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> can sustain idea that he
                            may ban <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> or otherwise make decision
                            for which army leaders hope, it seems likely that a number of army
                            voices would favor policy of “not rocking boat.”</p>
                        <p>9. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            is obviously under a great deal of pressure from many quarters to
                            announce his decision. There is also the compelling factor that foreign
                            governments from which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> hopes to get additional assistance and relief on
                            debt payments will be leery about actions to help Indonesia pending
                            clarification of political situation and more importantly evidence that
                            Indonesia has at long last come up with sound organization and
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>10. Although we have reports from at least two reliable sources that
                            Sukarno may very shortly announce his political decision involving
                            promotion of <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss>, there would
                            seem to be a somewhat better chance that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will go no further at this time than announcing
                            some limited reorganization of his cabinet that would give the
                            appearance of providing Indonesia's economy with better direction and
                            organization. Such an announcement might, in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s opinion, set the stage
                            for sending out missions to foreign capitals looking for debt relief and
                            credits. He might feel that this was all that was required, particularly
                            if men selected for top economic roles both in Djakarta and on these
                            missions enjoyed good reputations with the countries concerned.</p>
                        <p>11. Army leaders might find such a quasi-solution acceptable on several
                            grounds. A full-scale political decision would probably involve a
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> announcement they
                            would not favor, and could also touch off sharp reactions and even
                            disorders of a nature which army obviously wishes to avoid. Moreover
                            army would rationalize that, if economic situation continues to worsen
                            and if missions <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> sends
                            to other countries come back empty-handed, President may be forced by
                            events <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0436"/>to accept the kind of
                            reorganization of cabinet and attention to economic problems which the
                            army and other moderate elements seek. Hopefully <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could thus be brought to
                            heel.</p>
                        <p>12. At present and for at least the near future, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> seems to regard the army's
                            role in the power struggle as directed toward maintaining law and order
                            and preventing any kind of excesses either from the students or Moslems,
                            or even the Presidium. The kind of Presidium excesses which army would
                            probably not countenance would include outright legalizing of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, close Djakarta relations with Peking,
                            and actions that might isolate Indonesia even further from friends on
                            whom army and moderates might later on have to count in accepting
                            greater responsibility for government. I believe army would regard
                            breaking of diplomatic relations with US to fall in this category of
                            impermissible actions. Whether it would include unfriendly acts toward
                            the US such as the eviction of some of its diplomats here is less
                            certain.</p>
                        <p>13. I continue to feel that, as long as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has as much power as he has today, current
                            political and economic chaos will continue and probably deepen, and that
                            he will be working relentlessly to drive the revolution leftward in
                            direction of his goals of <gloss target="#t_NASAKOM1">NASAKOM</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_CONEFO1">CONEFO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Current army strategy of trying to chip away at powers of President may
                            succeed, but there is in my opinion an almost equal chance that
                            President can successfully divide and conquer his opposition.<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">The Office of Current Intelligence at <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, produced an Intelligence

                        <p>14. US capabilities to shape events are very slight, but we do have some
                            common interests with countries like Japan which have aid programs and
                            considerable influence in Indonesia. If these countries require a
                            realistic attack by <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on its basic
                            economic problems before they are willing to grant Indonesia relief on
                            debts and to extend further credits, this might in itself have a
                            salutary impact and could strengthen the hands of those in Indonesia who
                            seek such changes.</p>
                        <p>15. It might be useful to draw upon this theme in our discussions with
                            the countries concerned taking extreme care, of course, not to expose

                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reviewed the
                            present situation in Indonesia, four and one-half months after the
                            abortive Communist-backed coup of October 1. He noted that there have
                            been several favorable achievements, albeit mostly of a negative nature:
                            the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has been destroyed as an
                            effective political force for some time to come; the axis with Communist
                            China is in disarray; the Afro-Asian solidarity movement has suffered;
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s personal image
                            has been tarnished. On the other side of the ledger, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s ideology still pervades
                            Indonesian society, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and other leftist ministers have managed to
                            retain a large degree of their power, and the momentum evident in
                            November and December to reorganize and drastically reform the
                            governmental structure has been lost, largely because of the Army's fear
                            of widespread civil disorder and chaos. The Army has, in a sense, bought
                            unity at <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0438"/>the expense of further
                            action. The Army, as well as Moslem political groups who have a vested
                            interest in preventing the resurgence of the Communists that have been
                            decimated by wholesale massacre, will prevent a renaissance of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. The Army will also oppose
                            attempts to revive close relations with Communist China. Beyond that,
                            the Army is unlikely to openly confront <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who retains his charisma with the Indonesian
                            people and his domination of the older generation of political and
                            military leaders.</p>
                        <p>2. The impetus for change at present comes mainly from the younger
                            generation, particularly from student groups, and is sparked by
                            dissatisfaction with the incredibly bad management of government coupled
                            with increasingly chaotic economic conditions. Inflation and the
                            increase in money supply are rampant, and there are some areas suffering
                            from food shortages. In addition, years of living on a structure of
                            pyramiding credits have brought on a severe foreign exchange crisis that
                            is likely to be the spark igniting further political change. Indonesia
                            has a total foreign debt of approximately $2.5 billion on which payments
                            due in 1966 are $470 million. Since foreign exchange earnings are
                            expected to amount in the neighborhood of only $450 million, service on
                            the debt will obviously have to be rescheduled. However, to date
                            Indonesia has offered no signs of being willing to talk with creditors
                            as a group or to demonstrate it is prepared to tackle its problems in a
                            rational manner to induce capital exporting countries to be able or
                            willing to be of any assistance. The Army is following a policy of
                            remaining aloof from assuming the responsibility for economic problems;
                            and although the Army leadership has put out some feelers, it has made
                            it known privately that it does not want outside assistance at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. Reviewing the present state of relations of various countries with
                            Indonesia, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted
                            that the U.S. position was at least much better than in the pre-October
                            1 period, ChiCom-Indonesian relations are becoming increasingly
                            strained, and the Soviet position is at best unenviable. The Russians
                            are in the embarrassing situation where an Army in which they have a
                            large investment is actively suppressing a Communist Party, but at the
                            same time they are not displeased with the destruction of the power of a
                            thoroughly ChiCom oriented Communist Party. The Soviets probably would
                            not object to a situation developing in Indonesia somewhat analogous to
                            India, with both the U.S. and the USSR providing aid and with Communist
                            China out of the picture.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary noted that if the U.S. were ever able to play a role in
                            Indonesia again, particularly in regard to providing economic
                            assistance, there were two important prerequisites: some satisfactory
                            resolution of the Malaysian confrontation irritant, and some rational
                                <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0439"/>policy toward U.S. oil
                            companies that would not terminate in precipitous action that would
                            bring the Hickenlooper Amendment into effect.<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">The Hickenlooper amendment was to the Foreign
                                Assistance Act of 1961 and was revised in 1963. It forbade U.S.
                                assistance to nations which expropriated U.S. foreign property and
                                assets without compensation. (77 Stat. 386)</note> Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said that the military
                            viewed confrontation as an unproductive drain on Indonesian resources
                            that only served to divert military power from more pressing internal
                            security functions, but that a termination of confrontation would more
                            likely take the form of a gradual withering away rather than be the
                            result of a negotiated settlement. The American oil companies are faced
                            with difficult problems, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> expressed the hope that through a moderate and
                            far-sighted approach to negotiations they would find a formula to remain
                            in Indonesia; or that if impelled to pull out, they would do so without
                            retaliatory measures that would set off severe anti-American
                            reactions.</p>

                            coup last fall.</p>
                        <p>After employing brilliant “salami” tactics in eliminating the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as an effective political force,

                            using the political leverage they have gained against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The military fear their
                            unity will not hold up under a direct challenge to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and are once again
                            reverting to a policy of pursuing limited political objectives.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is exploiting the
                            military's hesitation to reassert his full powers and continue in force
                            his radical left domestic and foreign policies.</p>
                        <p>In effect, “two governments” are now competing for power and attempting
                            to administer the country. The struggle is likely to continue for some
                            months without clear resolution, but <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has maneuvered into a somewhat better position
                            to come out ahead.</p>
                        <p>Without effective government, severe inflation is rampant and the economy
                            continues its dangerous slide into chaos. The military are attempting to
                            saddle <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with
                            responsibility for national mismanagement while seeking their own
                            essential rice supplies through private channels abroad.</p>
                        <p>Our policy during this period has been to maintain correct relations with
                            the government without attempting to initiate new aid or other programs
                            of support. We are reluctant to bolster <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> through new monetary stabilization and other
                            aid, are still awaiting clarification in the current political
                            confusion, and are coupling aid with the necessity for improved
                            diplomatic relations and changes in Indonesian policies. The military
                            have been opposed to new, overt foreign economic assistance until they
                            have achieved certain (undefined) political changes.</p>
                        <p>Our ability to respond to Indonesian requests for aid when they are made
                            may be hampered by the simmering crisis between the Indonesian
                            Government and U.S. oil companies. The momentum of Indonesian harassment
                            has continued since the abortive coup last fall.</p>

                        <p>2. A specific question might be whether expanded quiet U.S. assistance to
                            the military might place them in a better position to blunt <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s impetus toward restoring

                                them we'd do so if and when they made the right noises. A word from

                        <p>At the President's request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> discussed current and prospective trends in
                            Indonesia, concluding with some general recommendations as to United
                            States policy in dealing with Indonesia. The Ambassador pointed out
                            that, even though relations between Indonesia and the United States
                            continue to be far from satisfactory, the abortive coup last October 1
                            had resulted in a crushing of the Communist Party; a great loss of
                            international prestige for Peking, whose hand was suspected as involved;
                            a continuing worsening of relations between Indonesia and Communist
                            China; a blow to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            pretensions as leader of the “new emerging forces” against the Western
                            world; and a certain loss of prestige and standing for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> among his own people.
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains on
                            as President and leader of the <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0443"/>revolution. He is succeeding to some extent in playing upon the
                            divisions and fears of his opponents in regaining power. He seems bent
                            upon getting the revolution back on leftward course. He is clever and
                            persuasive and still seems to have extraordinary physical reserves.</p>
                        <p>According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, the
                            Army-led opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, though unwilling to oppose <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> directly or frontally, is
                            deeply opposed to any revival of the Communist Party and to close
                            relations with China. The opposition would also like to see better
                            organization and more pragmatism in government. However, fearful of
                            civil disorders, concerned over the loyalty of their own rank and file
                            and infected with a good deal of Sukarnoism, the Army is reluctant to
                            oppose <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> directly. The
                            military may also be reluctant to assume too much responsibility for
                            events as long as Indonesia continues its downward course, economically
                            and politically.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> felt that the
                            deepening economics chaos, especially the crisis over foreign exchange
                            and the tendency of various ministries to bypass the central bank, may
                            force things to a head within the next six months or so. The situation
                            in Indonesia is going to be extremely messy for some time to come, he
                            added, and it is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy the
                            relative likelihood of a whole series of possible eventualities. What
                            does seem to be relatively clear is that we are now in an extended
                            transition phase between Sukarno and an unknown successor.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the Ambassador felt that the United States should
                            continue to maintain a low profile and preserve its options. The
                            Ambassador said he greatly appreciated the way American officials from
                            the President on down had avoided public statements about Indonesia.
                            Maintaining this kind of low posture continues to be essential, since
                            anything the United States says or does about Indonesia is subject to
                            distortion and misinterpretation. We continue to be deeply suspect of
                            trying to interfere in their affairs, which we of course are not doing
                            and must not do.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether all United States assistance to Indonesia,
                            including assistance to the military, had been terminated. The
                            Ambassador said it had, and he recommended that the United States not
                            extend further assistance to Indonesia until it really begins to set its
                            house in order. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is outspokenly opposed to any United States
                            assistance to Indonesia whereas the top Indonesian military leaders have
                            themselves secretly conveyed to us and to the Japanese that they are
                            opposed to any assistance at this time since it would benefit <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador nevertheless felt that we should keep an open mind with
                            regard to aid. A situation might suddenly arise where supplying
                            Indonesia with limited quantities of grain might be desirable <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0444"/>on humanitarian grounds as well
                            as to help prevent outbreaks of food riots and disorders that could
                            endanger foreigners in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>If the Indonesians do begin to undertake significant measures for
                            improving their organization and direction, then, in the Ambassador's
                            opinion, we should be prepared to lend a helping hand, preferably
                            through a consortium arrangement or through international bodies like
                            the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The President said he appreciated having these observations and that he
                            would leave it to the Ambassador to make specific recommendations as to
                            the timing and conditions under which the United States might extend
                            assistance to Indonesia.</p>

                            at all levels, and believe we must adhere to basic position stated

                            acted. In reaching this decision, we have taken full account of
                            additional conversation with Thanom and <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> reported in Karachi 1608<note n="4" xml:id="d195fn4">See <ref target="#d192fn4">footnote 4, Document

                        <p>2. In view of strong affirmative urgings of Thanom and <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, we now believe best tactical
                            method might be to discuss matter frankly, <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0445"/>probably with <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, before we make any response to Achmad.<note n="5" xml:id="d195fn5">In telegram 1694 from Bangkok, February 17,

                                transaction could be a “completely 'clean' deal.” Since <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> and Thanom were leaving for
                                Australia, Martin had his frank discussion with Dawee who said he
                                understood the U.S. decision, but regretted it. (National Archives
                                and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, INCO–RICE
                                17 INDON–THAI) In telegram 1701 from Bangkok, February 18, the
                                Embassy reported that Achmad had been informed of the U.S. decision
                                and at the same time assured of U.S. sympathy for <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Achmad regretted the
                                decision, but stated he understood the U.S. position. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Accordingly, you should see them and make following points fully and
                            frankly:</p>
                        <p>a. We accept Achmad's authorization to try to buy rice from Thailand, and
                            even to seek US credit backing for so doing. However, our own contact
                            with Indo military in Djakarta has left us with clear understanding that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> do not wish anything at present
                            time that could be identified as US aid. Accordingly, we are at present
                            skeptical of validity Achmad's statement that he is not worried by
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            would discover US involvement. Our own contacts leave us with directly
                            contrary understanding, so that our present impression is strongly that
                            any US role would have to be totally covert.</p>
                        <p>b. Any transaction on the scale of 50,000 tons, involving roughly $7
                            million, simply cannot be handled by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            on covert basis. We have examined this question exhaustively and believe
                            reports to the Congress of action taken, if not an outright Presidential
                            Determination, would be required, which in the existing state of
                            Congressional opinion, with at least a few vocal questioners of such
                            action, would mean that our action would almost inevitably become public
                            at US end.</p>
                        <p>c. Moreover, Indonesian lack of credit is well known in rice market and
                            any credit transaction would lead to immediate questions whether
                            Thailand could conceivably be carrying on such operation from its own
                            resources and to surmise in wide circles that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was actually backing transaction. This factor alone
                            would appear to us to remove any possibility that sizable transaction
                            could be kept covert.</p>
                        <p>d. Assuming that US role would thus come to light, there is our strong
                            judgment that exposure would be used by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> against Army leadership as evidence US efforts
                            interfere Indo domestic affairs. This could have serious and indeed
                            potentially disastrous effect on Army's current efforts to get clear
                            upper hand in face <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            increasingly resourceful political tactics.</p>
                        <p>e. In addition, from policy standpoint, USG would have some doubt whether
                            direct assistance to Army at this time might lead to weakening Army
                            resolve to work for basic economic reforms necessary <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0446"/>to create foundation on which outside
                            assistance would have regenerative effect.</p>
                        <p>f. As to Thai argument that Chicoms likely to give rice to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, our own judgment is that
                            Peiping/Djakarta relations are now at a new low and that Chicoms must be
                            well aware that Army in fact would control disposition any rice arriving
                            in Indonesia and would see to it that military needs met first.</p>
                        <p>g. Net of above is that we simply cannot see our way clear at this time
                            to take risks, amounting we believe to certainty, of disclosure <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> role, in return for doubtful
                            benefits.</p>
                        <p>3. You should then discuss frankly with <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> whether they or we should convey any message to
                            Achmad for time being. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: Although
                            they have clearly thought any transaction depended on us, our response
                            may cause them to reflect on handling at least modest trial deal on
                            their own. If so, we might wish to concert our response to Achmad with
                            what Thai say. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In any case, we
                            would not wish Thai to speak for us to Achmad other than along lines
                                <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1439, and if Thai have no
                            other ideas we should probably get this message to Achmad ourselves
                            after quick turnaround here.</p>
                        <p>4. In conveying all of above, you should of course make clear that our
                            reluctance proceed with this proposal indicates no lack of sympathy in
                            Indonesian problem nor unwillingness to help when we feel time is ripe
                            and preferably when assistance would be of maximum benefit to Army. If
                            for humanitarian as well as political reasons some injection rice and
                            other essential consumer commodities became necessary we would be
                            prepared consider rapid action. However, we do not believe situation has
                            reached this critical a point as yet. In any event, we wish continue
                            close consultation with Thai on Indonesian developments.</p>

                        <p>3. Achmad approach is one of a number of semi-official Indonesian efforts
                            probe availability of rice under favorable terms from range of possible
                            suppliers. Japanese have in past indicated readiness to supply if they
                            are convinced of real need and favorable political impact. There are, in
                            short, alternative sources of supply less dangerous to Army and donor

                            Unless the Indonesian military challenge these decisions, this
                            development will restore <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to full political control and will negate
                            Indonesia's anti-Communist tendencies that have been at work since
                            October. If the military decide to reverse <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s decisions, and it is not
                            at all clear that they will, the situation could degenerate into civil
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Reports from our Embassy tend to conclude that the military, and
                            particularly Army Commander General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, may not contest <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s move at this time.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">As reported in telegrams 2353 and 2363 from Djakarta, February 22.

                            This would be consistent with the military's past record of avoiding
                            direct political confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and of playing out a game of maneuver.</p>
                        <p>There are factors currently at work, however, which make this situation
                            more fluid than usual. In pressing a nationwide campaign of five months
                            against the Indonesian Communist Party, the military have unleashed
                            religious and political emotions that have even been directed against
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, himself, and
                            that might be difficult to hold in check. This would be particularly
                            true if Moslem and youth elements receive any encouragement from the
                            military. There are some reports that the military plans to foment
                            demonstrations to afford a pretext for their re-imposition of martial
                            law and the reversal of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s decisions. This would lead to the direct
                            confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            that the military has always avoided. But some Army elements might be
                            ready <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0449"/>to accept the risks of

                            Communist Party set in motion.</p>
                        <p>Although the situation is confused and fluid, one thing is clear: few if

                        <p>2469. 1. Following is Embassy analysis of present political situation and
                            future prospects insofar as these can be determined in highly fluid
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Tactics of major participants in political struggle have emerged more
                            clearly during past week. According present indications they are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Students. Students appear to realize that they themselves cannot bring
                            down present Indonesian Government and that only army can do so.
                            However, they feel strongly that army has waited too long and that they
                            must goad it into moving despite itself. Student demonstrations and
                            other activities are thus designed to force army to act.</p>
                        <p>B. Army. According some [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] reports army, for its part, hopes use
                            students and other groups to heat up atmosphere and then move against
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and other
                            leftists in high places using excuse of need to restore security.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not direct
                            target of this strategy but some within army reportedly realize he would
                            probably resist any action against <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and that army must therefore be prepared meet
                            him head on if necessary. (Note: <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0450"/>Strategies of army and students fit neatly together if army does, in
                            fact, move before student campaign loses steam.)</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> apparently believes that
                            strong stand will divide and weaken his opponents. During past week he
                            has returned number of radical leftists to positions of power, banned
                            Student Action Command, prohibited demonstrations and closed university.
                            He is apparently aware that many within army are reluctant to confront
                            him directly and believes that policy of firmness will further
                            intimidate military, as it has in past, and lessen chances that army and
                            civilians can unite against him in effective action.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus far old <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> magic
                            is not working as usual. Student activities have continued unabated
                            despite clear evidence of his displeasure. Yesterday's activities were
                            most open attack to date on <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself has come in for some criticism. As
                            campaign progresses students seem to be developing greater self-
                            confidence and sense participation in significant historical turning
                            point. Their determination is increased by numerous indications that
                            majority of people of Djakarta are with them.</p>
                        <p>4. There is still no firm indications that army will act although some
                            knowledgeable Indonesians during past few days have become more
                            optimistic. General <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>, in
                            contrast to his earlier pessimistic moods, told New Zealand Charge March
                            2 that generals may soon decide to become “patriots instead of
                            soldiers.” However, exact nature and timing of any army move against
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> or others in
                            top positions remain uncertain and it seems likely that army itself has
                            not firmly decided on these crucial questions.</p>
                        <p>5. Despite uncertainties in present situation there are number of
                            elements which make present situation more encouraging than it has ever
                            been in past:</p>
                        <p>A. Students and other civilian activists now seem to realize more than
                            ever before that they must lead army rather than simply wait for it to
                            act.</p>
                        <p>B. Younger officers within military are also dissatisfied with lack of
                            action by their superiors. This is additional element which could at
                            some point tip balance in favor of military action.</p>
                        <p>C. Army tactic of soliciting petitions from lower ranks could also
                            increase role of activist elements in determining army policy. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, who has reportedly asked for
                            such petitions to strengthen his hand with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, could actually get more
                            than he has bargained for.</p>
                        <p>D. Increased student activity places greater pressures on palace for
                            countermeasures. Escalation in present campaign could be dangerous for
                            palace since it might eventually lead to more open army intervention on
                            side of students.</p>
                        <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0451"/>
                        <p>6. Balanced against these favorable elements is not inconsiderable
                            ability of Sukarno to manipulate forces, as he recently did with NU and
                            Muhammadiyah. Army's position itself has a number of built-in
                            vulnerabilities. Its tactics are overly complex and lack clear focus,
                            particularly in continued unwillingness to face up to fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself is the
                            real problem. Army does not really need excuse of deteriorating security
                            situation to act if it really has will to do so. Moreover, by continuing
                            to reign students in from key targets army is actually hindering
                            creation of “unrest” which it hopes to exploit. There is also
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> might be able to unify elements now against
                            them through dramatic move on international level. Possible new summit
                            on Malaysia, stepped up confrontation, troubles with Philippines,
                            contrived crisis in relations with US or other issue might be used for
                            this purpose, particularly if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his supporters become desperate as result of
                            increased pressures against them.</p>
                        <p>7. In short run, and balancing factors, we believe chances for firm army
                            action to topple <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            directly are slim. Action to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and other left-wingers and thus break
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s power in two
                            stage process is considerably more likely but odds are probably not much
                            better than 50–50. Nonetheless this is significant improvement over
                            earlier situation.</p>
                        <p>8. Even if army does not act in short run, longer range prospects are now
                            far more favorable as result student campaign which has ushered in new
                            political atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>A. Students' enthusiasm and heroism have galvanized heretofore disparate
                            and passive opposition to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s regime. Several western-oriented Indonesian
                            intellectuals, for example, who had retired completely from political
                            scene, suddenly appeared on streets with students and we have many
                            reports of organized middle-class housewife network for feeding and
                            clothing students and even of spontaneous provision of free food by
                            street merchants and other lower class elements.</p>
                        <p>B. Students have also torn hole in political doctrine which identified
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with state and
                            which has allowed President to beat off clearly superior forces.
                            Students have shown many of their elders that one can be patriotic
                            without being pro-Sukarno or pro-government. They have done this by
                            adopting causes popular with broad segment of population (lowering of
                            prices and elimination of ineffective managers) and by conducting their
                            campaign in surprisingly orderly fashion which smacks neither of anarchy
                            nor rebellion.</p>
                        <p>9. In summary, we believe political struggle will be protracted. Student
                            demonstrations are likely to continue for some time despite <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s efforts to suppress them.
                            They will not bring about change <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0452"/>in regime in near future unless army joins in openly, and we see only
                            about 50–50 chance for this. Viewed in longer range, however, student
                            demonstrations have begun healthy reorientation of Indo political
                            thinking which will work against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and can eventually lead to downfall of his
                            regime.</p>

                                10, 1966, 0900Z</date>.</dateline>
                        <p>2536. 1. Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>, who
                            seemed to be in higher spirits than I've ever seen him before, told me
                            at rendezvous last night that situation is explosive, with army prepared
                            to move at any moment using 22 army battalions loyal to Generals
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Soeharto in and
                            around Djakarta area.</p>
                        <p>2. I said I understood <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            was planning to dismiss Soeharto. Was this true? He said President was
                            planning to dismiss either or both Soeharto and Adjie; and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> hoped <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would do so because this
                            would be precisely the action which would incite armed forces to move
                            physically against Presidium and bring about long-needed changes.</p>
                        <p>3. I remarked that on past occasions when army seemed united in its
                            resolve, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was able to
                            recapture initiative by calling in all the military brass including
                            regional commanders and putting on one of his performances which seemed
                            to leave military commanders uncertain as to how each other stood and
                            therefore they wavered at the crucial hour. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has called for such meeting
                            this weekend; will history repeat itself?</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> replied that he did not
                            think it would. All the Panglimas are behind Soeharto only awaiting his
                            order. However, army will not take initial step against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to avoid chances of
                            being the aggressor, but army action will be in the form of a
                            counter-action. Thus students and laborers will continue their
                            demonstrations until <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0453"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> provoked into taking
                            some action which will justify army counter-moves. This could be touched
                            off by a dismissal of Soeharto or Adjie or Sarwo Edhie or Mokoginta or
                            by Tjakrabirawa troops shooting students. An example of how close
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is to triggering
                            army move was when he and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> inspected ransacked Foreign Ministry March 9.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> so angry that he
                            ordered Tjakrabirawa troops to shoot at students.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> continued that even young
                            air force officers are now organized into teams supporting
                            anti-Presidium movement and have plans to sabotage any aircraft engaged
                            in escape of leftist cabinet ministers from Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that by far the most
                            important new element in situation since last we met a month ago was
                            student movement against <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and other leftist cabinet ministers. These
                            students more powerful than all parties put together and command much
                            wider sympathy and support. In fact, all previous anti-government
                            movements here have lacked this kind of popular support. Student
                            demonstrators include sons and daughters from most prominent families
                            including those who are in pro-Sukarno camp and they naturally exert
                            considerable influence on their parents. Moreover, soldiers and
                            policemen most reluctant to shoot at student demonstrators. As example,
                            he cited dilemma of one policeman charged with protection of Foreign
                            Office on March 8. When he pointed his gun at a student, he discovered
                            this was son of his superior officer. Policeman so shocked he
                            disappeared from scene. Same has happened to members of Tjakrabirawa
                            battalion, a number of whom have deserted.</p>
                        <p>7. Additionally, trade unions are getting into the act. Most of trade
                            unions will be supporting students actively by joining in demonstrations
                            and by strikes beginning this week.</p>
                        <p>8. I asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> whether dismissal
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> had been serious
                            setback for anti-Subandrio forces. He said not at all; <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, who continued to command
                            nationwide respect, could now operate more effectively behind scenes
                            than from office in Defense Ministry. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and Soeharto remained close but it was better
                            to have Soeharto the front man. I inquired about position of General
                            Machmud (Kodam V Commander in charge of Djakarta area). <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said he was completely with
                            Soeharto.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally and most importantly, I asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> about general security situation as it affected
                            Americans and American property. I pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> reaction to attacks by
                            students on his Foreign Office and against him personally seemed almost
                            certain to result in his trying to retaliate as well as divert
                            attention. He could not target the army or the students, so it was quite
                            probable he would incite his goon squads against our Embassy. We've
                            already had two examples of that in past <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0454"/>two weeks.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">On February 23
                                and March 8 small, well-organized groups of leftists attacked the
                                U.S. Embassy. There were no injuries and no attackers penetrated the
                                Embassy building. (Telegram 2509 from Djakarta, March 8;
                                ibid.)</note> I also had some rather disturbing reports from
                            unevaluated sources that Sukarno has indicated in his anger that he
                            would do to the Americans what he had done to the British several years
                            ago. This meant danger to our residences as well as the Chancery. What
                            did <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> think of that?</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> replied that undoubtedly
                            Subandrio will attempt anti-US actions. However, this will receive no
                            support from overwhelming elements here, and the army will definitely
                            step in to protect the Americans. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> felt there was no need to evacuate members of
                            American community from Djakarta but suggested that they remain out of
                            sight as much as possible, particularly during next week or so when
                            things likely to be hyper-tense.</p>
                        <p>11. I told <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> once again that I
                            hoped for a new relationship between our governments, one that was
                            productive and helpful from Indonesia's viewpoint, and that meanwhile it
                            was absolutely vital that nothing occur, such as anti-American actions,
                            which would gravely, if not permanently, injure our relations and
                            eliminate future possibilities for fruitful friendship and cooperation.
                            He said he fully understood my point. He felt the same way. He said he
                            was more assured than ever that things would work out the way we both
                            wanted. Certainly his mood reflected this assurance.<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">In telegram 2564 from Djakarta, March 12, 0150Z,

                        <p>12. I asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> to feel free to

                                    <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had authority to
                                act on his own initiative and was only required to report to

                                taken. (Telegram 2573 from Djakarta, March 12; ibid.)</note> full

                        <p>2. People of Djakarta are clearly with army. Moderate political parties
                            and other organizations have all issued statements pledging support to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Students, who created
                            atmosphere which permitted, and in fact forced, army to act, are
                            understandably jubilant. They are roaming through city today on foot and
                            in trucks repeating their slogans against <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, Sumardjo, “Gestapu
                            Cabinet” and high prices.</p>
                        <p>3. Key now is whether army will move quickly and effectively to
                            consolidate its position. Indications to date are that it will.</p>
                        <p>A. Parade this morning (septel)<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">Not
                                found.</note> has provided emotional outlet for people after weeks
                            of growing tension, and has demonstrated army's popular support. Whole
                            affair was carefully and effectively staged.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and all its front organizations
                            were formally banned by <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> at
                            noon today. While this somewhat academic since <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has ceased to exist as effective organized party, ban
                            is clear signal that army prepared to go directly against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s well-known wishes. Army
                            may well now move against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> elements
                            in Djakarta which has been virtual safehaven for them in past several
                            months. 4. It is not yet clear extent to which army will dominate new
                            government and extent to which it will be willing to share real power
                            with its civilian allies from anti-Communist political parties. However,
                                <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0456"/>odds would seem to favor
                            coalition between army and moderate political leaders such as <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>, Sultan of Jogjakarta, and
                            others. Group previously banned by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and older leaders, some of whom are imprisoned
                            and some merely on shelf, may play role as advisers but we doubt groups
                            which survived and which will play key role in government will be
                            willing to share fruits of their victory and yield important posts to
                            these elements.</p>
                        <p>5. If army moves to consolidate its position, and we believe odds are
                            that it will, we can probably expect following moves:</p>
                        <p>A. Major change in cabinet. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> has had it, and other pro-Communists and
                            incompetents can be expected to be replaced. Cabinet will probably be
                            reduced in size and streamlined. There could, however, be deal with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> which would save
                            some of his less obvious cronies.</p>
                        <p>B. Crackdown on corruption and effort by army to get its hands on illegal
                            funds many of present Ministers have salted away. Serious attention to
                            basic economic problems will probably follow later.</p>
                        <p>C. Re-evalutation and gradual reorientation of basic foreign policies.
                            Army will end <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            “axis” with Peking and might well drive ChiComs to point of breaking
                            relations. <gloss target="#t_CONEFO1">CONEFO</gloss> is likely to be
                            scrapped. Confrontation with Malaysia will remain on books but likely
                            slowly wither and die as far as serious military action is concerned. At
                            same time, army will be cautious in moving too close to West.</p>
                        <p>D. Root out political undesirables from positions of authority in army
                            and other military services.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is still on scene.
                            As long as he is there is danger of comeback but we believe chances of
                            full return to former position are remote. Army has taken first step. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> again pushes too
                            far, next step against him directly will be far easier.</p>
                        <p>7. Major government appointments and treatment present ministers will
                            quickly give indication of precise direction government will now take.
                            Government will continue to use many of the old slogans, as indeed
                            Suharto has done in his order of the day (septel).<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">Not found. According to telegram 1157 to Djakarta,

                            will be far more important than words and it on former basis that

                            <hi rend="italic">Backing up success</hi>. It is hard to overestimate
                            the potential significance of the army's apparent victory over <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> (even though the latter
                            remains as a figurehead). Indonesia has more people—and probably more
                            resources—than all of mainland Southeast Asia. It was well on the way to
                            becoming another expansionist Communist state, which would have
                            critically menaced the rear of the whole Western position in mainland
                            Southeast Asia. Now, though the unforeseen can always happen, this trend
                            has been sharply reversed.</p>
                        <p>The coup in Ghana is another example of a fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah
                            was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African.
                            In reaction to his strongly pro-Communist leanings, the new military
                            regime is almost pathetically pro-Western.</p>
                        <p>The point of this memo is that we ought to follow through skillfully and
                            consolidate such successes. A few thousand tons of surplus wheat or
                            rice, given now when the new regimes are quite uncertain as to their
                            future relations with us, could have a psychological significance out of
                            all proportion to the cost of the gesture. I am not arguing for lavish
                            gifts to these regimes—indeed, giving them a little only whets their
                            appetites, and enables us to use the prospect of more as leverage.</p>
                        <p>But my experience is that the bureaucracy will err on the side of caution
                            rather than initiative; hence my suggestion that, in expressing your
                            pleasure to SecState and others over the Indonesia and Ghana coups, you
                            make clear that we ought to exploit such successes as quickly and as
                            skillfully as possible. You have no idea how important a word from you
                            can be in setting the tone for the bureaucracy. And in this case I
                            strongly suspect that my own suggestion is quite in accord with your own
                            political instinct.</p>
                        <p>If you prefer, I would pass this word to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>;
                            but at the moment there is simply no substitute for direct word from
                            you.</p>

                        <p>1. Although there has been little tangible improvement in the state of
                            our bilateral relations with Indonesia during recent months, recent
                            developments there may eventually lead to significant long-range changes
                            in Indonesia's internal and external policies. There have been several
                            major results of the abortive October 1 coup attempt including: 1) the
                            decimation of the PKI as an organized political force; 2) a severe
                            strain in Sino-Indonesian relations; and 3) the emergence of new forces
                            that are articulating demands that run counter to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s fundamental philosophy
                            and the way he has been governing.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. During the five months that followed the September 30 attempt,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            jockeyed with the military for political advantage. On February 21,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> announced his
                            decision to reshuffle his cabinet in order to cut the ground from under
                            the military leaders who were offering the greatest threat to his power.
                            Eliminated in the shuffle were several prominent non-communists,
                            including Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, while all of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s known leftist advisers were retained. This
                            triggered a mass reaction. During the February 22–March 12 period,
                            thousands of students demonstrated almost continuously in the streets of
                            Djakarta demanding the banning of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>; ouster of <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>; and reduction of prices. During the past week
                            they occupied and ransacked the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, forced the
                            Education Ministry to close its doors, and violently attacked the
                            offices of the New China News Agency, Chicom Consulate General and the
                            Chicom Trade Mission in Djakarta, injuring several Chinese in the
                            process.</p>
                        <p>3. In weak counterpoint to these large demonstrations were two raids
                            staged on February 23 and March 8 against the U.S. Embassy by small but
                            well-organized groups of leftists. No one was injured, nor was the

                        <p>4. In a supreme effort to blunt the impact of the student demonstrations
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> scheduled a
                            series of three meetings over the weekend of March 12 that were intended
                            to divide and eventually conquer his opposition. The military, however,
                            reportedly concerned by reports that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> planned to replace <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> with a leftist general responded by handing
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> an ultimatum. In
                            response to the ultimatum, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> transferred responsibility for maintaining
                            security to the Army. Since that time <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has been issuing decrees “on behalf of”

                        <p>5. While the final resolution of the ongoing power struggle is not yet
                            certain, it would appear that the military has for the moment regained
                            the initiative. Their eventual success or failure depends largely on
                            their ability to: 1) retain their present momentum; and 2) maintain
                            internal unity within their own ranks. We will, of course, be watching
                            the development of the situation to see how we can adjust our relations
                            with a hopefully more moderate Indonesian government. We will also be
                            examining the advisability of some form of economic aid, at an
                            appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>6. The final question mark is Indonesia's newest political power
                            group—the students. Although they will side for the moment with the
                            military, they may in the long run prove to be Indonesia's most
                            significant “new emerging force.”</p>

                        <p>1. Following is our current assessment as to how Indo situation likely
                            develop and summary our current thinking as to nature of US response to
                            Indo requests for assistance, which seem to be inevitable and probably
                            in near future.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not expect either return of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to real power or rapid emergence strong,
                            economy-minded regime in near future. Even if new moderate government
                            emerges along lines para 5 ref B,<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">In
                                paragraph 5 of telegram 2633 from Djakarta March 16, Embassy
                                suggested that, “there would almost certainly be an eventual
                                rehabilitation of old pro-Western elements like Masjumi and <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> but probably under different
                                names.” Leaders like <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> would probably play a key
                                role.</note> it will likely represent compromise between various
                            remaining elements of Indo power structure, collectively concerned about
                            problem of establishing itself in effective control over country, and
                            both unwilling and unable to take dramatic or surgical action on
                            Indonesian economy. We assume Sukarno would preserve at least titular
                            power, and that effective exercise of responsibility by new regime will
                            be limited by a felt need to keep him reasonably happy through at least
                            continued lip service to Sukarno's official mythology for sake of
                            maintaining continued national unity.</p>
                        <p>3. Government of this sort is likely to be aware of and concerned about
                            basic economic problems of Indonesia, but will feel that it must get
                            through months ahead with palliative help from outside rather than by
                            taking on basic problems. Expect it will, for example, not dare make
                            significant reduction in size of civil service or army.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0461"/>
                        <p>4. This government likely make complicated series of bilateral appeals
                            through the usual traveling teams and through foreign ambassadors in
                            Djakarta for food and fibers and for debt rescheduling and new credits
                            overtly from Japanese and Europe, and, at least initially, covertly from
                            us.</p>
                        <p>5. When approached by Indonesians we might react as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. US interest in giving help depends on some showing that a constructive
                            Indonesian government is establishing itself firmly in power desiring to
                            pull country out of its present economic shambles. We are ready to help
                            such a government out with rice and cotton on terms which Indos could
                            advertise as commercial but which are in fact very concessional (along
                            lines Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s
                            discussions in Washington, using mechanisms like <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 and <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                            guaranty).</p>
                        <p>B. Concealment is impossible for us. We do not desire embarrass <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> or give erroneous impression that we
                            are trying to move back into Indonesian scene, but fact of life is that
                            any real role we can play in helping Indos will be public knowledge.</p>
                        <p>C. With respect to debt rescheduling or other aid apart from above
                            immediate food and fiber relief, following considerations apply:</p>
                        <p>i. We feel that support for Indos other than limited emergency measures
                            can only be effective or possible politically on multilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>ii. Our thought is that one or more nations friendly to Indos—such as
                            Japan—should be asked by Indos to take lead in arranging meetings of
                            creditor and perhaps other interested countries to analyze debts and
                            need for cash and credits during months while <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is attempting to reverse present deterioration and to
                            establish itself, and to decide how to proceed collectively in helping
                            Indos out of predicament. We would be glad to participate.</p>
                        <p>iii. Problem of Indo situation is international, and action taken must
                            involve equality of treatment of creditors, for which reason we believe
                            it important attempt secure participation USSR. We and other creditors
                            could not, for example, accept an arrangement on credits and debt
                            rescheduling which simply freed Indo assets to service Russian debt. We
                            believe Russians should be asked to participate in aid meetings (ii.
                            above) even though they may well refuse attend.</p>
                        <p>iv. We are willing to help <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> but we
                            cannot do so if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> continues to hammer
                            at us as its greatest enemy, is pursuing military confrontation or
                            confiscates US oil properties. These are not onerous preconditions and
                            we would not ask sharp changes in public policy of sort which might
                            endanger <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> existence.</p>
                        <p>6. We have it in mind that early if not first Indo request for support
                            will be to Japanese in course visit frequently deferred Indo economic
                            mission. When we and addressees have reached agreement as to US position
                            we believe we should review it in some detail with Japanese, both to
                            correct view reported para 4B ref A and to help Japanese prepare respond
                            to Indo request for aid. Action addressees requested comment <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0462"/>soonest on foregoing and on other

                        <p>1182. 1. As new Indonesian government attempts to build up international
                            support for Indo economy fact that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            has cut itself off from almost all international organizations will
                            present growing problem. We assume that responsible people like Sultan
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> aware of need to re-join
                            the world, but that they will feel need to proceed slowly and to avoid
                            challenging <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> decisions
                            directly.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe Indos should be encouraged to start reentry into at least
                            those organizations which can help them directly or through coordination
                            multilateral assistance. We expect <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            will be receiving advice to this effect from other countries they are or
                            will be approaching for help, but think it would be unwise for USG to
                            take initiative with Indos as they likely both to suspect our motives
                            and to assume our interest indicates they have new bargaining asset with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>3. At same time, Indos will probably worry about our reaction if they
                            attempt either rejoin any of organizations they have left or join others
                            they have not been in, notably Asian Development Bank. If feelers put
                            out indicating such concern, believe you should make clear <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0463"/>we would support Indo applications
                            quietly and would not seek exploit their action as western victory. If
                            your advice sought, you might suggest that Indo statement of intention
                            join <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss> (with which <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has no history) could be useful opening
                            gambit.</p>
                        <p>4. Foregoing position is, of course, based on our conclusion that Indos
                            should be drawn back into real world, that they likely prove unreliable
                            and often unfriendly voice and vote, but that importance of former
                            outweighs risk of latter.</p>

                        <p>This decision makes good sense. At the same time, however, I thought
                            you—and perhaps the President—should be aware of some of the additional
                            factors surrounding this recommendation:</p>
                        <p>1. There is a continuing argument between advocates of a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 route and advocates of a straight
                            export credit sale arrangement (with <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>
                            guarantee of a letter of credit from the Bank of Indonesia). In the
                            present decision, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 advocates
                            prevailed on the grounds that such an arrangement would be speediest and
                            would avoid a <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> guarantee of an
                            apparently bankrupt bank. There is a question, however, whether this
                            arrangement will be satisfactory to the Indos who would prefer a less
                            conspicuous U.S. Government involvement and would probably regard the
                                <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> route as the less conspicuous of
                            the two.</p>
                        <p>2. A third route was also considered: U.S. financing of Thai rice for
                            Indonesia. This, however, would have involved use of Supporting
                            Assistance funds and, according to our lawyers, a Presidential
                            Determination (under the Broomfield Amendment) that aid to Indonesia was
                            in our national interest. Such a step would become public and would
                            probably be an embarrassment to the Indonesians at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 route has some worrisome
                            implications for the future: as you may know, cotton dealers have been
                            attempting for some months now to obtain <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> guarantees for Indo letters of credit in order to push
                            the sale of raw cotton to Indonesia.<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">

                                company and cotton growers cooperation). <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> explained that since the Bank of Indonesia was
                                virtually bankrupt, a Commodity Credit Corporation (<gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>) guarantee of cotton sales was
                                tantamount to direct U.S. assistance. The chances of default by the
                                bank were extremely high. To add to the problem, top Indonesian
                                leaders like <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> had been saying
                                for the past 6 months that they wished to avoid anything that looks
                                like overt U.S. Government aid. For these reasons the Departments of
                                State and Agriculture rejected the <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> arrangement. (Ibid., Memos to the President,

                            apprehensive that the Government may opt for a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 provision of cotton, rather than straight commercial
                            sales under <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> guarantees. Our action
                            on rice will increase the apprehensions of the cotton people and their
                            supporters on the Hill.</p>

                            may portend a long range series of measures to ease the Malaysia
                            confrontation, even while publicly reiterating that the policy of
                            confrontation is continuing. The Singapore Government has welcomed the
                            Indonesian decision to normalize relations and has moved to reassure the
                            Government of Malaysia by declaring that it would <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0466"/>consult on all matters where Malaysia's
                            defense interests were affected. While the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s initial reaction was relatively calm, he has
                            subsequently attacked the move to normalize relations as a measure
                            designed to further Indonesia's policy of confrontation. Lee Quan Yew is
                            taking additional private steps to assure the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> that the normalization will not
                            be directed against Malaysia. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> remains suspicious over <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s continuing influence on
                            the confrontation policy, and this has tempered moves on his part that
                            might contribute to a reduction in tensions. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> is proceeding with plans
                            to return Indonesia to the United Nations and rejoin other international
                            bodies despite <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            public denial that this would take place.</p>
                        <p>Internally, the unabated drive against remaining Communist sympathizers
                            in government ministries has been augmented by the initiation of a
                            concerted campaign against the Chinese residents in Indonesia. The
                            sacking and burning of the Chinese Communist Embassy and related
                            pressures against the Chinese without official Indonesian restraints
                            indicate to our Embassy that the new leaders in Indonesia may be

                        <p>These events are indicative of the gradual movement now taking place on a

                        <p>This is a murky subject on which State sounds bureaucratic but is
                            probably right, for the time being.</p>
                        <p>We do have a sizeable cotton surplus, and it would be good for us and for
                            them if we were to unload some of it on the Indos. The two possible
                            routes are (1) <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title IV, and (2)
                            commercial sales, with <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> guarantee of
                            an Indo letter of credit.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the recent <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice deal, we
                            resisted both possibilities on the say-so of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            (who didn't want their struggle with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> complicated by any visible U.S. government
                            involvement).</p>
                        <p>Our present aim is both to meet bona fide Indo emergency needs and to
                            push the Indos toward doing more than living off the dole (ergo, tidying
                            up their house, planning, organizing multilateral aid, etc.).</p>
                        <p>So far, State has been reluctant to follow up too closely on the rice
                            deal with a cotton deal; but the prediction is that a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 cotton deal is probable within the

                            to Indo middlemen and (if they can collect) U.S. dealers. Some dealers,

                            safe-and-sure arrangement. But there are obviously conflicting

                        <p>At the 557th Meeting of the National Security Council on May 10, 1966,
                            Ambassador to Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge stated: “the recent overthrow of
                            the Communists in Indonesia is a direct result of our having taken a
                            firm stand in Vietnam.” For the complete account of the report of the
                            meeting, see <ref target="frus1964-68v04#d135">Foreign Relations,

                        <p>According to a memorandum from Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

                            analyzing the relationship between the Indonesian crisis and U.S.
                            determination in Vietnam. (Johnson Library, National Security File,
                            Country File, Indonesia, Vol. VI, 11/65–5/66) <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> submitted to <hi rend="italic">Rostow</hi> for the President an Intelligence Memorandum, <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss> No. 0815/66, May 13, which stated: “we
                            have searched in vain for evidence that the U.S. display of
                            determination in Vietnam directly influenced the outcome of the
                            Indonesian crisis in any significant way.” The Central Intelligence
                            Agency's Office of Current Intelligence concluded that the Indonesian
                            coup “appears to have evolved purely from a complex and long-standing
                            domestic political situation.” The memorandum did acknowledge, that “in
                            a strategic sense, it is possible—though there is no evidence for
                            this—that US determination in Vietnam did indirectly have some influence
                            in shaping events in Indonesia.” The memorandum suggested that without
                            US intervention, most of South Vietnam would have been in Communist
                            hands and China would have dominated Southeast Asia. Such a situation
                            would have encouraged <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            to accelerate his program to the point where the Army leaders would have
                            had to accede to his power. Still, the memorandum ended with the
                            statement that “no Indonesian leader among those now in ascendancy has
                            ever given any indication that he viewed the situation in this way.”

                            to scrounge a few extra liters of rice per year). Unless something could
                            be done to alleviate suffering of people, door would be open for
                            resurgence of communism. At this point <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> outlined his scheme for relieving Java
                            population pressures and increasing Indonesian export earnings by
                            transporting people from Java to Borneo to cultivate rice and develop
                            forest industries, a project which General Tasmin had already described
                            to DefAtt, and which we have reported. Like Tasmin, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> made pitch for US support for
                            this project even going so far as to add his hope that we could furnish
                            some LST's since building port facilities too time-consuming and
                            costly.</p>
                        <p>3. I replied there were a number of things we would both have to consider
                            in connection with this proposal. First there was the problem of
                            resuming a US aid program in Indonesia: so far his government had not
                            asked us for any aid and if it did, our administration would have to go
                            to Congress to request funds for program for Indonesia. It would, of
                            course, be in both our interests that such request be against background
                            of improving relationships and improved handling of Indo economic
                            problems. Secondly, we would both have to consider kinds <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0470"/>of assistance most useful to Indonesia.
                            I was most sympathetic to Java's poverty problem. We had supported at
                            one time, until <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> told
                            us to go to hell, a successful food for work project. In my personal
                            estimation, such project might have a high priority in meeting the
                            problem he mentioned. As far as Kalimantan's development concerned, he
                            might also wish to keep in mind advantages of assistance from foreign
                            private capital in opening forest and other industries. Support might
                            well come in larger amounts and more quickly from foreign private rather
                            than foreign government sources.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> replied that
                            opportunities for expanded agricultural production in central and east
                            Java were very limited. I questioned this but acknowledged there was
                            also need for development of Kalimantan and other outer islands. We
                            agreed these were all things we should talk about more.</p>
                        <p>5. Containment of China through <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            Cooperation. Discussion of this topic revolved almost entirely around
                            confrontation issue, with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            attempting to defend Indonesian policy along conventional <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> lines of argumentation but ended with a
                            firm statement of Indonesia's intention now to bring confrontation to
                            close. He expressed hope that Bangkok talks would provide satisfactory
                            solution based on Manila Agreement, but that this would require give and
                            take on both sides. Sole reason Suharto advanced for <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> desiring end of confrontation was in
                            order pave way for closer association with neighboring countries against
                            menace of Communist China. However, he argued this point with real
                            conviction.</p>
                        <p>6. I said we welcomed ending of confrontation for reasons he cited as
                            well as others. As far as Peking concerned, it had ever since late
                            summer 1963 greatly welcomed Indonesian confrontation policy which
                            served to divide and weaken areas over which Peking sought to extend
                            domination. I referred to intelligence reports about how Chen Yi, on
                            visit to Indonesia in Aug. 1965, had pressed for continuation of
                            confrontation and non-recognition of Singapore and Malaysia. Peking
                            seemed genuinely concerned at that time that Indonesia might be tiring
                            of confrontation policy, and in any event Peking wanted to isolate
                            Singapore from Malaysia and Indonesia in order to weaken its economy and
                            promote rise of the Barisan socialists. I said <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had earned much respect around
                            the world for the way he is seeking good relations with all Indonesia's
                            neighbors in this area. This would serve Indonesia's best political,
                            economic, and strategic interests. I trusted nothing would be allowed to
                            happen to interfere with accomplishment of settling matter so much in
                            Indonesia's interests and so contrary to objectives of Peking.</p>
                        <p>7. Ways and Means of Ending Vietnam War. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> spoke very briefly on this subject, emphasizing
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>'s desire to see end of war in
                                <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0471"/>Vietnam. He pointed out
                            that Indonesian mission to Hanoi last year had returned with impression
                            that Hanoi had divided feelings as between Peking-oriented communism and
                            Vietnam nationalism. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> asked
                            what I thought the chances were of a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>8. I described Peking as seeking to keep war going in order to undermine
                            economic and political order so as to pave way to extending Chinese
                            hegemony over that area. Peking also seeking to bring about humiliating
                            defeat of US and force withdrawal of American power from Southeast Asia
                            thus leaving area exposed to Peking dominance. I didn't think USSR would
                            be helpful in bringing about peace. Even though it might well desire to
                            see hostilities ended, it feared being labeled by ChiComs as soft and
                            revisionist which evidently Moscow feels would weaken its position with
                            certain Communist parties. Key to peace lay with Hanoi, and it was our
                            policy to make peace attractive to Hanoi while at the same time
                            aggression prohibitively costly. We are using minimum of force to this
                            end but we will not be deterred from using such force as is necessary to
                            uphold our commitments and help protect South Vietnam and, indeed, many
                            other countries from Communist aggression from North. I also gave brief
                            account of current events in South Vietnam drawing on gridiron report
                            and other materials.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> reiterated his
                            government's hope that peace could come to Vietnam and to all of
                            Southeast Asia. I said I hoped his government could make this point with
                            Hanoi, since it is up to Hanoi to respond to the many overtures from our
                            side supported by countries all around the world.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> once again said that he
                            hoped negotiations for ending confrontation would work out
                            satisfactorily so as to pave way for closer unity with its neighbors
                            including Thailand and Laos. I said I hoped we could keep in touch on
                            these matters. I would be glad to furnish him with information or
                            briefing materials and we would be most interested to have his views at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>11. Comments: Significantly, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> emphasized Pantjasila rather than <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as Indonesia's unifying
                            force and he did not refer to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> once either directly or indirectly. I was
                            disappointed he devoted so much time and emphasis to his Kalimantan
                            project. He must know my views on this since <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> had already taken it up with me. However, it is a
                            project dear to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s heart,
                            and, since <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is key figure
                            in Indonesia, we will have to give considerable thought to anticipated
                            future pressures for assistance in this project.</p>
                        <p>12. It was a useful overall exchange, most heartening for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s clear awareness of Peking's
                            threat to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. He referred throughout to
                            China as “the enemy.” This does not mean Indonesian willingness to
                            abandon non-alignment but it does imply broader Indonesian association
                                <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0472"/>with countries that can be
                            of assistance to Indonesia strategically as well as economically.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>State is anxious that you read the attached paper on Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>It's an excellent summary of the evolution of Indonesia and our policy

                        <p>The operational point is this (see pp. 4–6): if they get <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> out soon, we may well face
                            the following aid issues:</p>
                        <p>—Further emergency aid (P.L. 480).</p>
                        <p>—Multilateral debt rescheduling.</p>
                        <p>—Basic long term assistance (mainly European, Japanese, multilateral, but
                            perhaps some U.S. bilateral).</p>
                        <p>—Conceivably, some very small military assistance for training and civic
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Forward planning on this has been remarkably good, even to keeping key

                        <p>Paper Prepared in the Department of State</p>
                        <p rend="center">INDONESIA</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>1. Last October 1 the Indonesian Communist Party associated itself with
                            elements of the armed forces to stage a take-over of the Indonesian
                            Government which was promptly suppressed by the Army. Between October 1
                            and the middle of March of this year the Communist Party was virtually
                            eliminated as an effective political organization, perhaps as many as
                            300,000 Indonesians were killed—the great bulk of whom we believe were
                            in fact associated with the Communist apparatus. Political power
                            gradually shifted from President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and his Palace clique toward the Army, the
                            Muslim political parties, and anti-Communist students.</p>
                        <p>2. In February and March <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> attempted to seize full power again, was unable
                            to do so, and was forced to accept a new cabinet which was controlled by
                            the Army and by political moderates. By the end of March there was a new
                            government dedicated to economic and social reform, most of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s foreign policy had been
                            publicly challenged or was being ignored, and the triumvirate of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, the Sultan of
                            Jogjakarta and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName> took
                            effective, though not yet complete, power.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Present Situation—Domestic</p>
                        <p>3. In the past two months the new leaders have moved with surprising
                            speed to consolidate their power and to start on the long process of
                            putting together the almost totally shattered Indonesian economy. The
                            Communists seem to be effectively out of power, but <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remains as a President
                            still having the capacity to limit and interfere with the activities of
                            government. The government has, despite this, instituted new export
                            incentive programs, started to funnel Indonesia's export earnings
                            through the Central Bank, and succeeded in at least slowing down price
                            inflation of rice and certain other basic commodities. The economy is

                            made very substantial changes in foreign policy. It has announced to its

                            broken relations with Communist China. In Bangkok last week, Indonesian
                            representatives joined in expressions of interest in a loose-jointed
                            grouping of Southeast Asian states to include initially Malaysia, the

                        <p>5. The new regime has completely put an end to anti-American expressions

                            expressed some understanding of our position, and there have been some
                            reciprocal propaganda attacks between North Viet-Nam and Indonesia. In
                            another aspect significant to the U.S., the regime has decided against
                            further efforts to take over American petroleum company facilities which
                            produce and export crude oil, and seems to be negotiating in good faith
                            for the purchase of the one remaining American refinery (STANVAC).</p>

                        <p>6. The leaders' intentions are to continue to whittle away at <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, using as a next step the
                            mechanism of the “People's Parliament,” which is due to meet for about
                            three weeks starting in mid-June. The leaders intend to use this session
                            to remove <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s life-time
                            tenure on the presidency, to remove his special powers so that he will
                            become the figurehead, to secure formal approval of a settlement with
                            Malaysia, and in general to put the country's up to now rather nominal
                            legislative process firmly behind the new leadership. Having
                            accomplished these things, hopefully by mid-July, the intention is to
                            install a new working cabinet free of the last of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s henchmen, and then to
                            move full scale into economic rehabilitation. Other basic decisions such
                            as the dates for re-joining international organizations will probably be
                            deferred until this time.</p>
                        <p>7. Despite its apparent willingness to cease its aggressive policies in
                            the area—which the new regime recognizes as essential to external
                            assistance among other factors—we should not expect the new leaders to
                            be anything but intensely nationalistic, non-aligned, and “Afro-Asian”
                            in their orientation. Nonetheless, the contrast between these <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0475"/>policies and those of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, or those that would have
                            been pursued by the totally Communist-oriented regime that appeared to
                            be in prospect, is dramatic. All in all, the change in Indonesia's
                            policies has been a major “break” in the Southeast Asian situation, and
                            a vivid example to many other nations of nationalist forces rising to
                            beat back a Communist threat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Interest and Objectives</p>
                        <p>8. Our traditional interest in Indonesia has been to keep the country out
                            of the hands of Communists and out of the potential control of Communist
                            China. As the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime
                            moved more and more under Communist and Chinese influence prior to
                            October 1965, the United States inevitably became the number one
                            officially pronounced enemy of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime, and was billed as the only threat to
                            Indonesia's national security because of the presence of American forces
                            in the Philippines, the South China Sea, Viet-Nam, and Thailand. The
                            marked pro-Communist trend in Indonesia—accelerated in
                            mid-1963—undoubtedly rested in part on the conclusion that the U.S. was
                            losing ground in Southeast Asia. Conversely, although the U.S. had no
                            direct part whatever in the anti-Communist takeover that began in
                            October, unquestionably the fact that we were standing firm in Viet-Nam
                            reinforced the courage of the anti-Communist leaders; to put it
                            differently, without our evident determination, they would have been
                            very much less likely to have acted.</p>
                        <p>9. Our basic interest in Indonesia still derives from its tremendous
                            size, its population of more than 100,000,000, its location between the
                            Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and between Australia and the mainland, as
                            well as from its potential usefulness as a productive and influential
                            state which could serve as a unifying and constructive force in the
                            area. Our objective should be to help as we can in the development of a
                            responsible, moderate and economic-minded regime. Only such a regime can
                            prevent the resurgence of some form of extremism and, over time, play a
                            useful part in the area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Actions to Date</p>
                        <p>10. Until late March, our major policy on developments in Indonesia was
                            silence. The anti-Communist leaders wanted no cheers from us. This
                            policy remains generally sound, particularly in the light of the
                            wholesale killings that have accompanied the transition (even though it
                            is perfectly clear that a Communist takeover would have been at least as
                            bloody). Nonetheless, we have recently been quietly pointing out that we
                            take a favorable view of the new regime and have also been noting that
                            its succession would have been less likely without our continued
                            firmness in Viet-Nam and in the area. We should continue to applaud and
                            claim credit only to this extremely limited extent.</p>
                        <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0476"/>
                        <p>11. While continuing this public position, we have throughout made it
                            privately clear that we are ready at the right time to begin making
                            limited material contributions to help the new leaders get established.
                            Our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs had been entirely
                            terminated in Indonesia, but we have (in mid-April) agreed to sell them
                            50,000 tons of rice under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title IV
                            (dollar repayment) on terms of 4–7/8 per cent interest with five years
                            repayment. We are now beginning action on a Title IV sale of 75,000
                            bales of cotton on more generous terms, 3–1/2 per cent interest with 15
                            years repayment. We have quietly made it known we will support their
                            efforts to reenter international organizations, and that we will
                            participate in multilateral efforts to reschedule their debt at an
                            appropriate time. We have encouraged other free world countries to
                            extend emergency assistance to Indonesia in order to help the new regime
                            establish itself in the period before the questions of debt
                            rescheduling, stabilization and development can be dealt with.</p>

                            number of points at which U.S. assistance will be needed.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Further Emergency <gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss>
                            </hi>. There will be a probable need for further short-term assistance
                            to keep the economy going prior to multilateral decisions on long-term
                            problems. Our role in this can be played by further transactions under
                            Public Law 480. While we have been providing assistance under Title IV
                            on concessional terms, we should plan to switch to Title I (local
                            currency repayment) if the political situation stabilizes, in order not
                            to add further to Indonesia's already overwhelming foreign exchange
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Multilateral Debt Rescheduling</hi>. Indonesia has a
                            foreign debt of more than $2.5 billion. Approximately $170 million of
                            this is owed to us, and about $1 billion to the Soviet Union, mostly
                            military. Debt servicing requirements this year may amount to about $450
                            million, which is more than probable gross foreign exchange earnings for
                            the same period. Since Indonesia is already in default on both private
                            and government accounts, rescheduling is obviously necessary. We have
                            been in close touch with Indonesia's free world creditors, have made it
                            clear that we regard it as essential that rescheduling be multilateral,
                            and that we would like to see some other country, such as Japan, or an
                            international organization, play the leading role in organizing the
                            rescheduling exercise. The Sultan of Jogjakarta and various of his and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s representatives have
                            recently visited Japan and obtained a commitment for credits of $30
                            million as emergency aid. The Sultan plans to visit Western European
                            countries in July. Other representatives plan to visit the USSR and EE
                            countries. It now seems probable that <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0477"/>the Indonesians will be ready for formal multilateral
                            consideration of the debt in late July or August. The probable
                            Indonesian proposal will be along the lines of a five-year
                            moratorium—which among other things defers such knotty issues as the
                            priority status of military as compared to economic debts. We should be
                            prepared to participate, and to agree to rather generous terms provided
                            we do so in a framework taking account of interests of all
                            creditors.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Basic long-term assistance</hi>. Beyond emergency
                            aid and debt rescheduling, Indonesia is going to need both technical
                            assistance and further credits if the country is going to get back on
                            its feet. However successful their performance in restoring integrity to
                            the Central Bank, cutting government deficit financing and promoting
                            production and exports, it is quite likely that by the fall of this year
                            the ability of the new government to preserve its authority will depend
                            upon access to substantial foreign credits to rehabilitate both industry
                            and agriculture, as well as to restore the badly damaged communications
                            and transportation systems. Much of this needed credit can be obtained
                            from Japan, from Western Europe, and very probably from such
                            international organizations as the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and (later) the Asian
                            Development Bank. We have already made it clear that we expect long-term
                            assistance to be on a multilateral basis, and the willingness of other
                            sources to contribute substantially will be affected by the U.S.
                            contribution. Hence, we believe we should be prepared to pledge
                            significant amounts, and the need for such pledges may arise sometime in
                            the fall if the constructive trend in Indonesia continues at its present
                            pace. Hence, it is conceivable that we will need substantial 1967 <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds, both for direct assistance and
                            for channeling through the Asian Development Bank. The debt situation
                            will foreclose the Export-Import Bank as a source of additional
                            assistance, and our only other channel would appear to be additional
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 commodities on concessional
                            terms amounting to assistance.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">With respect to military assistance</hi>, the
                            Indonesian Army is excessively large and amply equipped for internal
                            security. We should not consider resuming any military assistance
                            programs except for a possible small-scale training effort largely for
                            the sake of personal ties with key military figures of the future. There

                            on a normal inter-agency basis. Moreover, we have kept in touch with key
                            leaders of Congress, who appear to understand the <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0478"/>situation and its possible
                            implications. The fact that any major assistance would be on a
                            multilateral basis would have particular appeal in many Congressional
                            quarters.</p>
                        <p>14. Nonetheless, in view of the impending dimensions of the problem in
                            the next six months, it now appears wise to initiate more extensive
                            consultations with the Congress, and it may be wise to designate a
                            specific group within the Executive Branch—perhaps as a subcommittee of
                            the Senior Interdepartmental Group—to keep the problem under very close
                            review.</p>

                            Committee on 17 November 1965<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">See <ref target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note> was to assure during a
                            period of national turmoil emergency communications capabilities for
                            selected Indonesian Army officers. This system was to provide adequate
                            communications between these anti-Communist officers and subordinate
                            headquarters in areas most susceptible to dissidence and rebellion.</p>
                        <p>On 26 February 1966, representatives of an intelligence organization
                            responsible to General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            and attached to the former Armed Forces Staff (SAB), requested that High

                            between that intelligence organization, General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>With the concurrence of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was advised on 12 May of the availability of
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] for use in communication with his principal
                            commands. He was asked to designate communications officers to supervise
                            receipt of this equipment. General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed enthusiasm and arranged for Indonesian
                            army technical personnel to be available for briefings on the equipment
                            by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] communications specialists. Discussions were held
                            on 2 and 3 June between these [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] personnel and Assistant to the
                            Chief of Staff SUAD IV (Logistics) General Hartono, Director of Army
                            Communications, General Suhardjono, and his Deputy Colonel Soerhadji.
                            Suhardjono asked why only [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] were being provided, since actual
                            establishment of a full net of reliable communications with all 17
                            Military Areas (KODAM) and other key headquarters would require a total
                            of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>This request for additional equipment has the support of the U.S.
                            Ambassador to Indonesia, and is concurred in by the State Department's
                            Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs.</p>
                        <p>The factor of risk in delivery has been considerably lessened by the
                            substantial diminution in both numbers and authority of leftist and
                                pro-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> elements in
                            the Indonesian Government. Nevertheless, delivery will be accomplished
                            through [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>],
                            and appropriate security measures will be observed when making
                            deliveries to the ultimate recipients. The Indonesians still cannot
                            ostensibly or actually purchase this equipment in the U.S. without
                            seeking exception to the U.S. export license controls, and inferring a
                            more intimate relationship with U.S. Government officials than is
                            desirable at this juncture. Exposure of this activity might provide
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                            residual leftists in the Indonesian political scene with embarrassing
                            ammunition to use against General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his associates.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Problem</p>
                        <p>The requirement is to provide on an urgent basis, the present Indonesian
                            Army leadership with sufficient additional [<hi rend="italic">less than

                            subordinate commands. This equipment will provide a system of

                            conditions of unrest and rebellion, at a time when normal communications
                            channels may be manned or usurped by politically unreliable

                            developed that the protection of the relationship between the United

                            November 1965, the 303 Committee approved the provision of emergency

                            officers.</p>

                            ascendancy of General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                            his political and military associates, substantial fragmentation is
                            evident within political pressure and military organizations. An
                            undeterminable proportion of this fragmentation is taking place at the
                            behest of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and his adherents. Should an open break take place between the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> elements, an emergency

                            return to the pro-Peking policies of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. This communications system
                            will provide for effective troop deployment, and will assist in assuring
                            the security of moderate Indonesian military and civilian political
                            elements.</p>

                            as a substantial step forward in the long process of de-Sukarnoization,
                            but it acknowledges that even the marginal room for political maneuver

                            that in this time frame the Indonesians finally clarify their own
                            thinking, improve their economic planning apparatus and move into a
                            position where they can effectively attack their deep-seated economic

                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and the Sultan have sent

                            of urgently needed goods valued at $495 million, and raise the question
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and possibly the Sultan

                        <p>We have told Widjakmika that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                            would be welcome (without discussing dates or committing a session with
                            the President), we want to be helpful on aid, particularly in
                            multilateral debt rescheduling, but much still depends on the formation
                            of a strong and effective government capable of using outside
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> team has completed its
                            preliminary survey, Indonesia has formally applied for re-admission to

                            modest scale, separating this out from broader questions of aid
                            resumption. Even this, however, will require a Presidential
                            determination under 620 (j) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and
                            Section 118 of the Appropriations Act of 1966. But it makes good
                            political sense to prepare the Congressional atmosphere in this <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0483"/>manner for the later resumption

                                Indonesia.” This memorandum stated that the army held the ultimate
                                power in Indonesia and although military leaders were prepared to
                                permit a voice to non-Communist civilian political elements, they
                                hoped to limit their activities so they did not endanger the policy
                                developed in response to the October 1965 coup. Indonesia's
                                Government was dominated by the triumvirate of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, and the Sultan of Jogjakarta, who planned to
                                name a cabinet before August and hold elections in 2 years. The most
                                pressing problem in Indonesia was its poor economic situation.

                        <p>Indonesia's new education plans stress elimination of the influence of 10

                            effort, warranting our support, with its success representing perhaps
                            our most important investment in Indonesia's future. The limited stable
                            of first rate economists, who are now assuming top level responsibility,
                            were trained at Harvard, Stanford and the University of California
                            before the program was halted in 1964. Indonesia's ban on travel to the
                            U.S. for study was lifted in June; there is a reservoir to draw on of
                            200 cases fully processed before the ban; new selection criteria and
                            procedures pose no great difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The clear advantage of seeking the resumption of aid through a
                            Presidential Determination that focuses primarily on the re-activation
                            of participant training is the probable smooth sailing it would have
                            with Congressional leaders. It would pave the way for other forms of aid

                        <p>The new cabinet whose composition was announced by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> on July 25 represents a major
                            step in the campaign to ease President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> out of effective power and into a figurehead
                            role. Although Sukarno fought hard to induce the <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss> (Peoples Consultative Congress) to
                            give him a voice in the cabinet's formation and lobbied tirelessly for
                            his cronies and against the new leadership, General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> managed to retain the upper hand
                            and name only his own people to key positions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Only Minor Concessions to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>

                            title First Minister for Economics and Finance. The other two first
                            ministers and members of the Presidium are Idham Chalid, leader of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> (Orthodox Scholars) Party, for
                            People's Welfare, and Sanusi Hardjadinata, a <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> figure (Indonesian Nationalist Party) with the industry
                            and development portfolio. The presence of these two politicians in what
                            is otherwise a cabinet of technicians is primarily a concession <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0487"/>to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the parties. However,
                            the two leading <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> hacks
                            from the last cabinet, Ruslan Abdulgani and <persName corresp="#p_LJ9">Johannes Leimena</persName>, have been dropped, despite the
                            President's desperate efforts on their behalf. The pro-Western
                            Ambassador to Thailand, Burhanuddin Mohamed Dian, has been named
                            Information Minister to replace Abdulgani. One of the most significant
                            changes requires that the 24 regular ministers report directly to the
                            Presidium, which <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> heads,
                            instead of to the President, who is no longer prime minister but only
                            chief of state.</p>

                        <p rend="center">INDONESIA</p>
                        <p rend="center">Background</p>
                        <p>1. On October 1, 1965, the Indonesian Communist Party joined with
                            elements of the armed forces in an effort to stage a coup by
                            assassination. Six of Indonesia's most prominent generals were killed.
                            Loyal Army elements under General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> rallied and crushed the coup attempt within 48
                            hours. This was the beginning of one of the most dramatic political
                            reversals in recent history. A major nation, which was moving rapidly
                            toward a domestic Communist takeover and was intimately associated with
                            Communist China, within three months destroyed the Communist threat and
                            altered significantly its domestic and foreign orientation.</p>
                        <p>2. The first element in this political change was the destruction of the
                            Indonesian Communist Party, the fourth largest in the world. The Army
                            hunted down and executed the principal Communist leaders. In the small
                            cities, towns and villages groups of youths, encouraged by the Army and
                            motivated by religion, historic local grievances, and fear of their own
                            fate had the Communists taken power, embarked on a systematic campaign
                            of extermination of Communist Party cadres. While the exact figure will
                            never be known, an estimated 300,000 were killed.</p>
                        <p>3. The second aspect of this political revolution was a systematic
                            reduction of the powers of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with the object of retaining Sukarno as the
                            historic revolutionary figure and symbol of Indonesian unity, but
                            depriving him of the power to govern. This process proceeded in stages.
                            In March, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was forced
                            to delegate extraordinary powers to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SC2">Saleh</persName>,
                            and others of the coterie of Palace followers who in the past have done
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s bidding were
                            removed from power and imprisoned. This was followed in July by a
                            meeting of the People's Consultative Council in which General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s mandate was confirmed and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was stripped of
                            his position as lifetime President. On July 25 a new cabinet, led by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and purged of
                            remaining pro-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            figures, was formed. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            remains on the scene, has a capability to obstruct and delay, but has
                            lost the power to initiate or act.</p>
                        <p>4. Working with General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                            the Army were two key leaders: <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam
                                Malik</persName>, a former newspaper man whose service as Ambassador
                            to Moscow has modified and rationalized his Marxist orientation; and the
                            Sultan of Djogjakarta—the only public figure with a charismatic appeal
                            to the people of Java comparable to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s own. In addition, a new and powerful force has
                            emerged on the Indonesian <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0489"/>political scene associated with the Army, but apart from it. It is
                            composed of students who have come of age in the post-revolutionary
                            period and are fed up with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, his empty slogans, and the economic chaos and
                            bankruptcy which he has brought on the nation. These students, moving in
                            huge public demonstrations, have been the cutting edge of political
                            change.</p>
                        <p>5. On the international side there has been a rapid deterioration of
                            Indonesia's relations with Communist China and the Asian Communist
                            states, and a corresponding improvement in Indonesia's relations with
                            the United States and the West. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> announced Indonesia's intention to
                            return to the United Nations and its associated international agencies,
                            and Indonesia has already applied to rejoin the International Monetary
                            Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In
                            June, Indonesian and Malaysian delegations met at Bangkok and reached
                            preliminary agreement to bring an end to confrontation, and <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> has indicated an interest in
                            Indonesian participation in Southeast Asian regional organizations.</p>
                        <p>6. These political developments took place in an economic situation of
                            wild currency inflation, a bankrupt Central Bank, and a foreign debt of
                            $2.5 billion, whose annual servicing alone comes to more than the
                            country's total annual foreign exchange earnings. The Sultan of
                            Djogjakarta, the minister responsible for economic development,
                            announced early in April a sensible and rational new approach to
                            Indonesia's economic problems. Most of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s pet projects, which were consuming vast
                            quantities of scarce foreign exchange, have been suspended, and the
                            virtual termination of military confrontation with Malaysia has removed
                            another major resource drain. Money was scraped up earlier this year to
                            purchase rice from Burma and Thailand, and these imports combined with a
                            good domestic rice crop have averted the immediate danger of a food
                            shortage, although without imports, rice may be short in the winter
                            months.</p>
                        <p>7. There has been, however, only modest progress in dealing with the root
                            causes of Indonesia's economic collapse. The overall cost of living
                            index has increased since October 1, 1965, by a factor of 12 and the
                            amount of money in circulation by a factor of 5. Anti-Chinese riots have
                            intimidated this important entrepreneurial community and caused an
                            exodus of Chinese businessmen and a flight of Chinese capital. The
                            Sultan's sensible words have not been followed by firm measures. The new
                            cabinet inaugurated on July 25 shows considerable strength in the
                            political and social ministries, but the overall level of professional
                            competence of the economic ministers is low and a number of important
                            portfolios remain in the hands of corrupt or incompetent officials. The
                            management capacity of the swollen bureaucracy continues at a low level.
                            It should be noted, however, that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0490"/>his
                            associates have up to now given priority attention to the political
                            objectives of establishing themselves in power and restricting the
                            powers of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. These
                            objectives have been achieved to a major degree. There is no lack of
                            understanding of the severity of Indonesian economic straits and there
                            appears a good prospect that economic matters will now begin to receive
                            more high-level attention.</p>
                        <p rend="center">United States Interests and Objectives</p>
                        <p>8. Our traditional interest in Indonesia has been to keep the country out
                            of the hands of its domestic Communists and out of the orbit of
                            Communist China. This objective has, through the events of October 1 and
                            their aftermath, for the time being been achieved. While protecting
                            these major gains, our objective now is to help this populous,
                            potentially rich and strategically placed nation—hitherto a disruptive
                            force in Southeast Asia—overcome the inheritance of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s mismanagement, develop an
                            effective government, and become a constructive force in the area.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Interests and Objectives of our Allies</p>
                        <p>9. We share these objectives with many of our friends. The economies of
                            Japan and Indonesia are complementary, and Japan wishes to play a
                            leading role in helping the Indonesian economy get back on its feet. The
                            trading nations of Western Europe are also attracted by Indonesia's
                            natural resources and the potential market of 100 million people. For
                            Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and the Philippines, an economically
                            healthy, politically friendly Indonesia is essential to their national
                            security. Indonesian recovery is also in the interest of the Soviet
                            Union and its Eastern European allies, who regard Indonesia as a
                            desirable market and source of raw materials. For the USSR as well as
                            for the West, an unaligned Indonesia represents an Asian counterweight
                            to Communist China.</p>
                        <p rend="center">United States Strategy and Past Actions</p>
                        <p>10. Until late March we kept silent on developments in Indonesia, a
                            policy welcomed by the principal leaders of Indonesia's anti-Communist
                            revolution. However, we gave them private encouragement and demonstrated
                            our support by furnishing small amounts of urgently needed supplies.
                            After the March cabinet reshuffle removed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s henchmen, we responded to
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s request
                            for 50,000 tons of rice under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480,
                            Title IV, on near-commercial terms. This was followed in June by a
                            similar sale under Title IV of 75,000 bales of cotton on generous terms
                            of interest and repayment. We have informed <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> that we are prepared to consider a further sale of
                            cotton either direct or for third country processing. We have also
                            encouraged other Free World countries to extend emergency assistance to
                            Indonesia, and <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0491"/>Japan, the
                            United Kingdom, Australia and West Germany have made varying amounts of
                            emergency grants and credits available.</p>
                        <p>11. Our strategy has been to provide, and to encourage other friendly
                            nations to provide, such assistance to Indonesia while its leaders
                            complete the process of political consolidation and place themselves in
                            position to deal with the tough problems of economic reform and
                            reconstruction. We have been working closely with Japan and other
                            countries, who share our objectives in Indonesia, to organize a
                            multilateral approach to Indonesia's longer term problems. This will
                            involve a rescheduling of Indonesia's foreign debt, perhaps preceded by
                            a moratorium, followed by other measures which will help Indonesia deal
                            with inflation and restore the shattered export industries on which the
                            economic health of the nation depends. A preliminary meeting of the
                            informal “<gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> to Indonesia Club” met in
                            Tokyo on July 19 and a further meeting is planned for mid-September. We
                            and Indonesia's other friends have emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> must play a key role in this reconstruction process.
                            An <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> mission has already visited
                            Indonesia and the new government has issued a formal invitation for the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to assist in the development of
                            a stabilization plan.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Future Actions</p>
                        <p>12. During the short-range period of emergency support we propose to take
                            the following actions:</p>
                        <p>a. We will continue to use the resources of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 and its successors to provide food and cotton to
                            Indonesia, and may also use <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credits
                            for this purpose. We are considering sales under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, Title I, to provide rupiahs for our internal needs
                            in Indonesia and to avoid adding to Indonesia's already heavy dollar
                            indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>b. As soon as we can remove certain legal obstacles to the resumption of
                            aid arising from provisions of the Hickenlooper Amendment (Section
                            620(c)) and 620(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act, we intend to request a
                            Presidential Determination, required under Section 620(j) of the same
                            act, that furnishing assistance to Indonesia is in the national
                            interests of the United States. Under a Presidential Determination we
                            propose to provide on Indonesia's request:</p>
                        <p>i. civilian participant training in American universities;</p>
                        <p>ii. military training in US Service Schools in skills which have a civic
                            action application;</p>
                        <p>iii. modest amounts of industrial raw material and spare parts to
                            reactivate US equipment already in use in Indonesia;</p>
                        <p>iv. modest amounts of spare parts and technical advisory service to the
                            Indonesian military for the rehabilitation of previously supplied US
                            equipment for use in civic action projects;</p>
                        <p>v. text books and reference books at the university level and possibly
                            some technical advice on aspects of an economic stabilization program
                            and other self-help measures; and</p>
                        <p>vi. participation, if Indonesia so desires, in regional technical
                            assistance of institutional development programs.</p>
                        <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0492"/>
                        <p>13. Our actions in the longer range economic development effort are
                            difficult to anticipate at this time, since we expect to be working with
                            other countries under the aegis of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and hopefully the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            in a multilateral setting. As a rough preliminary estimate, based on
                            imperfect data and an uncertain time frame, we might wish to contribute
                            a sum in the range of $50 million (including <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480) to a multinational program to provide necessary
                            imports to rehabilitate Indonesia's production plant and to restore
                            badly run-down communications and transportation systems. The amount may
                            vary with the hardness or softness of debt rescheduling terms, since
                            debt relief is a form of aid. Depending on the amount and type of funds
                            needed, it may be necessary to ask Congress for supplementary funds to
                            carry out this long term program. We have been in close touch with key
                            members of Congress on this question, have mentioned this rough estimate
                            of possible future needs, and have found them favorably inclined towards
                            our plans for helping Indonesia. Before any such program is likely to
                            begin, however, Indonesia and its creditors must reach agreement on debt
                            rescheduling and Indonesia must begin to implement a stabilization plan.
                            These in turn will require difficult Indonesian decisions in areas such
                            as budget revenue and expenditure, exchange rates and export incentives.
                            Commitment of our assistance would be related to and paced with
                            Indonesian performance in these areas.</p>
                        <p>14. At some stage we may wish to consider the return of the Peace Corps.
                            Indonesia will need a broad range of middle-level skills, and when the
                            program is resumed, it should include the widest possible spectrum of
                            Peace Corps activities. Its previous entrance and exit had, however,
                            major political overtones, and until we have clear evidence that the
                            Indonesians want the Peace Corps we mean to proceed with caution.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Anticipated Future Problems</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Army</p>
                        <p>15. The Indonesian Army now and for some time to come will control the
                            destinies of Indonesia. The Army is a major source of strength, and
                            appears to be solidly united behind <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. It has a highly motivated, well trained,
                            professionally competent officer corps. Many officers were trained in
                            the United States, and a number of them have considerable competence in
                            civilian administrative skills. It is an army proud of its record in
                            winning Indonesian independence and determined to protect the fruits of
                            this independence. (It has put down major insurgency movements in
                            virtually every major island of the archipelago.) It is an army that has
                            thus far resisted the temptation of a complete military takeover: it has
                            preferred to work with civilian <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0493"/>leaders and maintain its image as the servant rather than the master
                            of the state.</p>
                        <p>16. The military is also a source of potential weakness and
                            vulnerability. It has consumed over the past six years between 60 and
                            70% of the Indonesian budget, and may find it difficult to accept a more
                            modest share. It has over 300,000 men under arms and is equipped with
                            sophisticated modern weapons, largely of Russian origin, which it now
                            neither needs nor can afford to maintain. It has a basic distrust of the
                            civilian politicians, little patience with the disorder of free
                            political exchange, and no major commitment to democratic freedoms as we
                            know them. There is a danger that the Army may in the course of time
                            move in the pattern of Burma to a military authoritarian state. The
                            armed forces will wish to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union,
                            with whom they have a still unused balance of $110 million of the
                            original loan for military equipment.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Indonesian Military and the US</p>
                        <p>17. As noted above, many Indonesian officers have been trained in US
                            Service Schools. There are, as a consequence, strong US-Indonesian
                            service-to-service ties. We have, therefore, through our attaches in
                            Indonesia and other direct contacts with Indonesian officers, some
                            capability of influencing their policies and actions. This influence
                            carries with it its liabilities. The Indonesian military, and
                            particularly the Army, have been accustomed to turn to us, as well as
                            the USSR, for military supplies. Indonesian officers in informal
                            conversations have indicated an interest in resuming a military
                            assistance program for Indonesia and have spoken of “requirements,”
                            running into hundred millions of dollars, which they hope to obtain from
                            the United States. We will have a difficult task of deflecting these
                            completely unrealistic expectations while continuing to maintain our
                            personal ties and influence. In this context, the training and civic
                            action programs proposed in previous paragraphs take on a special
                            importance and urgency.</p>

                        <p>18. Indonesia in the past has dealt with its economic problems by
                            skillful use of political and economic leverage to obtain grants and
                            loans from over 30 countries. This habit of looking to others to deal
                            with their economic problems will persist. All preliminary proposals for
                            economic rehabilitation place undue and over-optimistic reliance on a
                            presumed availability of external resources. Indonesia, in short, would
                            prefer to shift the major burden of its economic recovery onto the
                            shoulders of its foreign friends. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and the Sultan have indicated their support of the
                            multilateral approach described above, but we must anticipate in the
                            coming months requests for substantial bilateral assistance justified
                            almost exclusively on political grounds. We should <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0494"/>attempt to head them off, but if
                            unsuccessful we should not respond favorably without the most careful
                            scrutiny for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. Favorable response to these large “emergency requests” will reduce
                            domestic pressures and retard rather than accelerate the process of
                            economic reform;</p>
                        <p>b. Indonesia's capable trading community and its cadre of
                            western-trained, performance-oriented economists who are preaching the
                            need for forceful domestic efforts to cope with the economic situation
                            will be undercut if we respond to emotional political appeals;</p>
                        <p>c. If we grant further credits we would not only be adding to Indonesia's
                            debt burden, but would also be projecting ourselves into political
                            difficulties with them because of the conditions we would have to
                            require to be reasonably certain of repayment.</p>
                        <p>19. A firm but friendly policy of responding bilaterally to short-range,
                            small-scale emergency needs and confining major assistance to the
                            multilateral framework carries acceptable risk for the following
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>a. The subsistence sector of the Indonesian economy, embracing 75% of
                            Indonesia's 100 million population, has survived over a decade of
                            monumental mismanagement and continues to have considerable
                            resilience;</p>
                        <p>b. The fertility of the soil, the general availability of fruit,
                            vegetables and root crops reduces the political pressures of hunger or
                            dire poverty;</p>
                        <p>c. Indonesia is largely free of absentee landlords and inequitable land
                            distribution;</p>
                        <p>d. For the time being and for the foreseeable future there is no
                            conceivable political alternative to an Army-dominated government;</p>
                        <p>e. The political repercussions which they warn us of will operate for the
                            foreseeable future to produce internal reform rather than overthrow of
                            the government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Indonesia's International Posture</p>
                        <p>20. While Indonesia has renounced its past close association with
                            Communist China and the Asian Communist powers, we can expect nothing
                            better than non-alignment from Indonesia. Indonesia will continue to
                            remain publicly critical of our actions in Viet-Nam, although <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> from time to time will attempt to
                            soften the impact of these statements by private expressions of
                            understanding. Indonesia, when it returns to the United Nations, will
                            undoubtedly resume its position as one of the more militant of the
                            Asian-African bloc, and while it will no longer stand invariably with
                            Cuba and Albania on major issues in the United Nations, we will continue
                            to find it opposing us on many key questions.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Confrontation</p>
                        <p>21. The Bangkok Agreement laid the groundwork for termination of
                            confrontation, but it has not yet been ratified by the Indonesian <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0495"/>Government. Small-scale border
                            incursions have continued, and there are signs that some elements of the
                            Indonesian Army may attempt to delay ratification in hopes of exacting
                            further concessions from the Malaysians. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            appear sincere in their announced determination to end confrontation,
                            but there may be further delays. In the longer perspective, as Indonesia
                            begins to emerge from its economic difficulties we must anticipate that
                            there will be adventurous elements in Indonesia that may revive efforts
                            to extend control over Malaysia and the Borneo states.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Timing</p>
                        <p>22. As we approach the problem of consolidating the gains which the
                            Indonesians themselves have achieved in the past ten months, timing is
                            of paramount importance. We must adjust to the pace which the
                            Indonesians themselves have set for securing their own economic and
                            political salvation. To move too quickly, to show a greater sense of
                            urgency in getting on with the job than the Indonesians themselves feel,
                            will give these resourceful people the idea that they can exact
                            concessions for the privilege of helping them. To move too slowly and to
                            be too rigid in our responses in meeting major needs will encourage a
                            latent threat of complete military takeover, and the emergence of an
                            adventurist totalitarian regime. We are dealing not with an economic
                            infant, but a sick giant with historically proven capacity for quick
                            economic recuperation. We are dealing with a talented and resourceful
                            population, proud, self-confident and determined to stand on its own
                            feet. We are dealing with an island nation where the circumstances of
                            geography and the incredible productivity of its soil tend to break
                            problems into manageable units.</p>

                        <p>Embassy Djakarta and the State Department have recommended the resumption
                            of limited US economic and military assistance to Indonesia on a
                            short-range emergency support basis. Purpose of this assistance is to
                            encourage the Army-dominated government to take much-needed steps to put
                            Indonesia's economic house in order. However, there is no military
                            justification for a resumption of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            for Indonesia; the proposed military assistance would be largely for
                            political and economic purposes, to support civic action projects and
                            strengthen US rapport with the Indonesian military through training of
                            Indonesian military officers in US service schools.</p>

                        <p>The State Department has prepared a paper for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">Not

                            policies to justify <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> consideration of
                            short-range economic and military assistance. State's recommendations
                            are based on proposals contained in Embassy Djakarta's 144 (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Not attached, but see <ref target="#d213fn2">footnote 2, Document 213</ref>.</note> which includes specific
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funded projects. However, these
                            actions would have to be preceded by a Presidential Determination as
                            required under Section 620(j) of the Foreign Assistance Act and by the
                            removal of certain legal obstacles to the resumption of aid arising from
                            provisions of the Hickenlooper Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act.
                            The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have recommended (Tab C)<note n="4" xml:id="d216fn4">In <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-473–66, July 25, attached but not printed.</note> a
                            small and highly selective military assistance program that would
                            include support for civic action projects and a CONUS training program
                            for Indonesian officers.</p>
                        <p>We are in general agreement with the State Department paper, except that
                            we see no military justification for a military assistance program at
                            this time. The civic action proposal is essentially a political effort
                            designed by the Indonesian Army to improve its image with the public and
                            to avoid large demobilization. While a case can be made that economic
                            and financial assistance to Indonesia is now in the US interest, the
                            same is not true of military assistance. The US has little to gain by
                            building up the Indonesian Armed Forces, which are among the best
                            equipped of any indigenous armed force in Southeast Asia. The Indonesian
                            Army is fully capable of maintaining internal security in the major
                            islands and has received more equipment from the Soviet Union and the
                            United States than it has been able to use. On the other hand, it might
                            be very advantageous to the US to have substantial <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0497"/>numbers of young Indonesian officers
                            study in US service schools, as well as in civilian institutions, and
                            also for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to support the
                            Indonesian Army's civic action program by providing technical advice,
                            spare parts for engineering equipment, and perhaps some new
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions.</p>
                        <p>1. There appears to be no military justification for a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in Indonesia in the foreseeable
                            future.</p>
                        <p>2. Training (especially CONUS training) is probably a good idea. I
                            recommend it (in US).</p>
                        <p>3. I recommend against other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items. I
                            do not want a “non-training” <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program
                            resumed in Indonesia. The civic action program has political importance,
                            however. I therefore urge that technical assistance, spare parts for
                            civic action equipment, etc., be covered by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (which may be hard legally) or through sales financed

                            dramatic change in Indonesia's internal political situation and its

                            most U.S. aid to Indonesia which was then rapidly moving toward becoming
                            an out-and-out Communist state.</p>
                        <p>He asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to report to the group
                            on recent Indonesian developments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that on his recent trip to Asia, he had met with many
                            signs of a new mood and new confidence in Asia. He said the atmosphere
                            was clearly attributable to two things:</p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>(1) Our obvious determination to stand fast in Viet-Nam and to help
                            preserve the physical security of the area;</p>
                        <p>(2) The abrupt reversal of Indonesia's course.</p>
                        <p>An important question was whether the Indonesian changes were going to
                            stick. He thought that all things considered there was a good chance
                            they would. There was an outside chance of a revival of Sukarnoism.
                            There was a chance, too, of internal bickering in the armed forces that
                            could break into open conflict. But the Secretary thought both of these
                            chances were remote.</p>
                        <p>On confrontation with Malaysia, the prospects for an end looked
                            promising.</p>
                        <p>The main problem was economic. He underlined the external debt problem
                            and the need for rescheduling. He noted the large debt to the Soviets
                            and said we had to be careful that we were not giving aid to Indonesia
                            that merely went into repaying the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>He estimated the probable need for economic assistance from us at about
                            $50 million the first year.</p>
                        <p>He stressed the desirability of working through a multilateral framework
                            in providing aid to Indonesia. He said the Japanese role would be
                            particularly important.</p>
                        <p>Regarding U.S. policy, the Secretary said that we had deliberately moved
                            slowly to date. This was largely a response to Indonesian desires that
                            we not assume too great or obvious a role. We and they recognized that
                            an excessive U.S. reaction to internal events could be the “kiss of
                            death” to the present leadership.</p>
                        <p>In the short run, our assistance would move largely through <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, and he noted that we had already
                            sold rice and cotton to Indonesia through this channel.</p>
                        <p>He said we were working on the problem of the Hickenlooper amendment,
                            looking to a Presidential Determination that would find aid to Indonesia
                            in our national interest. This awaits certain actions by the
                            Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>He said it was important to get the Indonesians and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to knuckle down to a comprehensive
                            development plan for the country.</p>
                        <p>We would have to expect that we would face making a distinction between
                            what the Indos will want and what we think they can effectively use in
                            terms of economic aid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary summarized his views by saying:</p>
                        <p>the problem of Indonesia is of vital importance;</p>
                        <p>we must be ready to move quickly and effectively;</p>
                        <p>we must try to speed up the multilateral approach to the problems of debt
                            rescheduling and aid.</p>
                        <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was of the impression that the Congress was in a
                            mood to support this general approach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said he concurred in the
                            Secretary's description of the problem.</p>
                        <p>On confrontation, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] Malaysia's Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> would be going to Jakarta at the
                            end of August. He would reach agreement with the Indos that:</p>
                        <p>(1) Confrontation should be ended;</p>
                        <p>(2) Full diplomatic relations would be restored as soon as there was
                            reconfirmation of the desire of Sabah and Sarawak to remain in the
                            Malaysian family.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the present government, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> thought the new cabinet was the best in years. He
                            admitted it was somewhat weak in the economic field. But he said it was
                            behind the Triumvirate and strengthened the latter's hand. He thought
                            the three leaders (<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and the Sultan of
                            Jogjakarta) were all good men and that the administration had an aura of
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>He underlined the economic problems, noting, for example, that 55% of the
                            country's transport was inoperable.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought we should follow the line recommended by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. He stressed the
                            importance of keeping Congressional circles fully informed of
                            developments and of our thinking. He asked for the Vice President's
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> agreed
                            with the need for keeping Congress aware of developments in Indonesia.
                            But he said there was a far more sympathetic mood on the Hill now. He
                            said many Congressmen saw what had happened in Indonesia as a
                            consequence of our firmness in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>He said it was vitally important for us to encourage other countries to
                            lend a helping hand in Indonesian economic rehabilitation. He noted he
                            had talked with Minister Miki of Japan about this and that Japan had
                            recently granted Indonesia a $30 million credit.</p>
                        <p>The role of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was discussed and it
                            was noted that there was a problem of Indonesia's $47 million debt to
                            the Fund which would have to be solved.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said two things were
                            worth noting:</p>
                        <p>(1) That Indonesia provided a chance to establish a new pattern of
                            multilateral help in Asia;</p>
                        <p>(2) That here was an opportunity to link multilateral assistance with the
                            newly established Asian Development Bank.</p>
                        <p>This was a pioneer case and there was a chance to develop around
                            Indonesian aid the Asian equivalent of <gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss> in Latin America. Asians <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0500"/>who needed help should go to Manila, not to Paris; a
                            new and encouraging pattern could emerge and should be encouraged.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether this was not along the same line as the
                            recommendations for Africa in the Korry report.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">Dated July 22, 1966; printed in part in <ref target="frus1964-68v24#d215">Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, vol.
                                    XXIV, Document 215</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that the
                            African Development [Bank] would be weaker, but that the Asian
                            Development Bank would have real strength.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for an estimate of how much the proposed assistance
                            was going to cost.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> thought the cost
                            of military aid would be small—less than $10 million.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that the
                            overall cost—including <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 and
                            cooperation in multilateral aid—would be less than $100 million.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion of the cost for assistance to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said the problem in
                            Viet-Nam was less a matter of money than of priorities and Vietnamese
                            capabilities to absorb.</p>
                        <p>On Indonesia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said that
                            the emphasis on multilateralism could not be too great. He said that the
                            Indonesian case provided an opportunity to give an effective answer to
                            Senator Fulbright.</p>
                        <p>He also noted that the requirements for additional aid might be less than
                            we think. He noted that refunding of Indonesia's large debt would free
                            considerable funds which could take the place of external aid. He also
                            noted that with our PL–480, the Japanese loan and other sources, some
                            $80 million had gone into Indonesia in recent months in short-term
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the chances were for a comeback by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said he thought the
                            president [<hi rend="italic">present</hi>] leadership in Jakarta could
                            control this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that the Army
                            and others knew their lives would be in danger if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and Co. returned to
                            power. They therefore had a large personal stake in preventing any
                            revival of Sukarnoism.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> commending the Korry report on Africa to the
                            principals as one of the best jobs of its kind he had seen in a long
                            time.</p>

                                    Office of National Intelligence prepared a memorandum for the
                                    Director, August 16, entitled, “The End of 'Confrontation:' The
                                    Debit Side,” which concluded that although the end of
                                    confrontation would eliminate the threat of open warfare between
                                    Indonesia and the British Commonwealth and allow Indonesia to
                                    concentrate on economic affairs, it would also lead to increased
                                    Indonesian political influence in Malaysia and progressive
                                    diminution of British political and military influence. These
                                    developments would alter Malaysia's pro-Western orientation, and
                                    increase tension between Malays and Chinese. Although Indonesia
                                    gave up efforts to subvert Malaysia, it would not abandon its
                                    long-term goal of becoming the dominate power among peoples of
                                    Malay blood. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>The signing of the Bangkok Accord in Djakarta on August 11 ends
                            Indonesia's military confrontation of Malaysia, but Indonesia's interest
                            in dismembering Malaysia remains active and there are still obstacles to
                            stable relations.</p>

                            One, Malaysia agrees to a reaffirmation by the people of Sabah and
                            Sarawak “in a free and democratic manner as soon as practicable through
                            general elections” of “their previous decision about their status in
                            Malaysia.” In Article Two, Indonesia and Malaysia agree to resume
                            diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives. And,
                            finally, in Article Three, both countries agree that “hostile acts
                            between the two countries shall cease forthwith.”</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Secret Letters</hi>. Although Malaysia promptly
                            accepted the Bangkok Accord, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> refused to sign it. As an inducement to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> in June proposed an
                            exchange of secret letters with Malaysia at the time of the formal
                            signing of the Bangkok Accord. These would delay implementation of
                            Article Two until Article One had been carried out; in other words, de
                            jure establishment of diplomatic relations would have to await the
                            elections in Sabah and Sarawak. With <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0502"/>considerable reluctance and after the exchange of many
                            draft letters, the Malaysian government agreed.</p>
                        <p>It seems doubtful that the secret letters will remain secret for long.
                            Neither government however seems to fear that public disclosure, if it
                            occurs, will undermine its ability to portray the Bangkok Agreement as a
                            national victory: for Kuala Lumpur a victory in bringing about
                            Indonesian recognition of Malaysia and for Djakarta a victory in
                            bringing about a reascertainment in Borneo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The Promise of Reascertainment Could Cause
                                Problems</hi>. The reaffirmation provision is one that the
                            Malaysians found it very difficult to accept. Initially they were given
                            to understand by the Indonesians that the requirement was pro forma; in
                            exchange for inclusion of the commitment in the agreement, Indonesia
                            would refrain in future from insisting that it be implemented. In
                            subsequent negotiations, however, it became clear that the Indonesians
                            had shifted from this position and regarded an actual reascertainment as
                            indispensable. Present Malaysian expectations, bolstered by the language
                            of the agreement, are that the requirement can be satisfied by a
                            question on the ballot at the next regular election in each state that
                            will, in effect, produce an endorsement of the existing situation.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the promise of reascertainment may bring political
                            rumblings within Malaysia. As far as is known, political leaders in
                            Sabah and Sarawak were not consulted. Indeed the Chief Minister of
                            Sarawak, upon hearing the rumor that the Bangkok Accord provided for a
                            reascertainment, announced that he would not allow such a question to be
                            put on the ballot in his state.</p>
                        <p>In addition the date of the elections could be controversial. Indonesia
                            wants them held as soon as possible. Although <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> has said they will be held “next
                            year,” Malaysia is not necessarily prepared to act very quickly.
                            Elections are not mandatory in Sabah until mid-1969 and in Sarawak until
                            mid-1968. While there are domestic political reasons why an election
                            might be held in Sabah in 1966 or 1967, there is serious doubt that
                            electoral districts could be delineated and voter lists compiled in time
                            for an early election in Sarawak. More compellingly, it is unlikely that
                            Kuala Lumpur, which only this June put the present government of Sarawak
                            into power by somewhat questionable means, would want that
                            administration tested in an early election.</p>
                        <p>Quite apart from the question of timing, other issues may make the
                            reaffirmation provision a troublesome one. Indonesia, where interest in
                            dismembering Malaysia is by no means confined to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, is already supporting
                            dissident Sabah and Sarawak politicians and is stepping up the
                            infiltration of agents into both East and West Malaysia. Moreover, there
                            are indications that Indonesia may request observers at the elections.
                            If it does so, the Malaysians, recalling the problems over observers <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0503"/>for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> survey in August 1963, may be reluctant to comply. There
                            could be disagreement on this point and delay while the question is
                            settled, or Indonesia could use the absence of observers as a pretext to
                            denounce the results of an election just as it denounced the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> survey.</p>
                        <p>Whether either side will refrain from exploiting the ambiguities of the
                            reaffirmation procedure to make difficulties with the other, will depend
                            heavily on the survival of conciliatory attitudes in Kuala Lumpur and
                            Djakarta. Kuala Lumpur must continue to see the advantages of obtaining
                            Djakarta's full formal recognition of Malaysia's sovereignty within
                            present territorial limits as outweighing distaste for going through
                            even the motions of a reaffirmation and overlooking the clandestine
                            activities the Indonesians seem intent on maintaining. Restraint in
                            Djakarta on the other hand, may be closely tied to the calculation that
                            prospects for substantial economic assistance from the West are
                            significantly related not only to the termination of military
                            confrontation but also to the maintenance of normal and amicable
                            relations with Malaysia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I recommend that we now proceed with implementing program of US
                            short-term assistance to Indonesia outlined in reftel and spelled out in
                            greater detail in follow-up messages.</p>
                        <p>2. Since sending of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> one month
                            ago, Indonesia has installed a new cabinet which, together with filling
                            of subcabinet positions, has provided Indonesia with greatly improved
                            government, especially taking into consideration <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s ever-dwindling influence.
                            Moreover, during past month, Indonesia has brought its three-year-old
                            costly confrontation with Malaysia to a close and in other ways as well
                            has <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0504"/>abandoned reckless jingoism
                            in favor of a constructive role in international affairs. The road to
                            resumed US assistance has been further opened by our investigation of
                            ways to remove statutory obstacles impeding resumption such aid, such as
                            lack of procedure to settle private claims, and I believe they now have
                            been resolved. Claims for damages to Embassy are being paid.</p>
                        <p>3. Though <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will continue to face
                            problems of enormous magnitude in rehabilitating its long neglected
                            economy and will be challenged all along the political front, the
                            triumvirate, backed by major segments of the army, students, and
                            population generally, will strive toward objectives which we regard as
                            consistent with our own interests and purposes. If current momentum is
                            sustained, Indonesia is likely during next several months to rejoin the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other international agencies
                            including <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and to assume an ever closer
                            relationship with its immediate neighbors (Malaysia, Australia,
                            Thailand, Philippines) as well as retain close behind-the-scenes
                            consultations with US officials. Given this momentum, we can see real
                            prospects for a new and wider association of Southeast Asian countries
                            in which Indonesia, larger in population than all the others combined,
                            will play a fraternal role. Though less clear, we would hope to see
                            Indonesia face up in more dynamic fashion to handling its economic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>4. However, we do not believe that this momentum will be sustained
                            without adequate early evidence of assistance from other countries,
                            especially the US. Aside from argumentation contained reftel, there is
                            strong belief here amongst all officials, notably amongst military who
                            likely continue to be dominant element in Indonesia for some time, that
                            foreign aid and investment are vital and urgent. Their belief in this
                            causal relationship has been a key factor in shaping rational official
                            decisions. If Indonesian Government supporters believe that needed aid
                            is unavailable, we may see government giving in to counsels of
                            discouragement and a resurgence of the Sukarnoists who will argue that
                            present <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policies have been built on
                            false expectations. Top-level Western-trained Indo economists, now
                            hesitating over whether to participate fully in new government, will
                            drop out if they feel US support for new government is lacking. Moreover
                            it is inadvisable to await outcome of Tokyo talks before lending real
                            helping hand. Even though we fully agree on desirability of multilateral
                            approach to Indonesian assistance program this may take some time to
                            work out. Meanwhile there are compelling needs for some assistance
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>5. I therefore request authorization now to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> short-term bilateral US assistance
                            on basis program outlined reftel and subsequent messages. We hope be
                            forthcoming soonest, at least on educational exchange and hopefully on
                            additional activities proposed <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. In particular, we recommend quick action on: (a)
                            participants <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0505"/>and book program;
                            (b) authorization for negotiations for rice and cotton on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I basis as preferable to Title
                            IV in view overall stabilization and debt rescheduling objectives; (c)
                            authorization for negotiations on Title II few programs based
                            continuation Indramaju project and initiation high-impact elements new
                            Demak proposal; and (d) authorization for negotiations on spare parts
                            and raw materials loan, with consideration being given both to <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>/IDA channel (if <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> technician can accompany <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> team and thus reach Indonesia sooner
                            than technicians under any other possible arrangement), and to direct
                            bilateral loan which would have advantage of restriction to US suppliers
                            only. Additionally, we believe it would be useful sometime soon to
                            commence negotiations on investment guarantee agreement which would be
                            of major immediate help to our current discussions with US business
                            representatives now visiting Djakarta as well as considered essential to
                            long-term maintenance of American private investors position in
                            Indonesia. We will be commenting further on this point.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> proposal set forth reftel
                            remains unchanged and represents a logical and manageable start in this
                            highly important facet of assistance. Certain areas of assistance for
                            the Indonesian military are not finite and depend in some measure on
                            priorities which are currently being determined by the Indonesian army
                            staff under its G–4, MajGen Hartono. In the main, it is expected that
                            the military side of the overall assistance program will be dominated by
                            an emphasis on civic action in its broadest sense to include schooling,
                            spares for engineer equipment, overhaul and repair of transportation
                            means and equipment. <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and aid will be
                            complementary in many areas and especially in civic action. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s outer island
                            development plan including aerial survey is not included in present
                            recommendations pending further study. Indications are that it remains
                            high on General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s personal
                            list of priorities.</p>
                        <p>7. Request urgent action be taken ensure I receive instructions for

                            is high and before his departure for Moscow (still uncertain, possibly

                            on an interim assistance program. As discussed at the recent <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on Indonesia,<note n="5" xml:id="d220fn5">See <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>. </note>
                            our hope is that long-range assistance can be worked out on a
                            multilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> hopes we can tell
                            the Indonesians that we are ready to move ahead on short-term emergency
                            aid for the Indo economy before Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> leaves for Moscow on September
                            2.</p>
                        <p>Items that might be considered for action under this Determination are:
                            (1) PL 480 food and cotton; (2) spare parts and replacements for U.S.
                            equipment now in Indonesia; (3) participant training; (4) technical
                            assistance, including advice, textbooks and training aids; (5) possible
                            inclusion of Indonesia in regional development programs; (6) modest
                            scale resumption of civic action training of the military.</p>
                        <p>State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> estimate that such interim
                            programs, excluding PL 480, might cost somewhere between $12 million and
                            $22 million. There is no commitment on any of the above; the list is
                            only illustrative.</p>
                        <p>Congressional leaders have been kept informed of Indonesian developments.
                            The specific question of immediate, short-term aid resumption has not
                            been posed.</p>

                        <p>State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> wonder whether you
                            prefer:</p>
                        <p>1) to proceed with <gloss target="#t_PD1">PD</gloss> as is;</p>
                        <p>2) to sign <gloss target="#t_PD1">PD</gloss> but withhold announcement
                            until key Congressional leaders and Committee chairmen can be
                            informed;</p>
                        <p>3) to get a reading from key Congressmen before proceeding.</p>
                        <p>The Indonesian economy is in shambles. The new government desperately
                            needs short-term help. It would be to our great advantage to move
                            quickly on some of these modest but psychologically important programs
                            before a mood of desperation sets in Djakarta. It would help greatly to
                            be able to tell the Indonesians of our willingness to begin talking
                            about some of these matters before <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> takes off for Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore recommend course 2 above.<note n="6" xml:id="d220fn6">There is no indication on the memorandum as to

                        <p>I met with His Excellency <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam
                                Malik</persName>, Foreign Minister of Indonesia, at the Sheraton
                            Ritz Hotel, Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday, September 25, 1966.
                            Accompanying Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> were his
                            aide, Mr. Widjatmika, and General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s personal advisor, Colonel Soejono.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> expressed his
                            appreciation of my seeing him in Minnesota. He said that he was
                            specifically requested by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> to extend his personal greetings and recognition
                            of my encouragement to the anti-Communist forces of his country, dating
                            back to 1963.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> reported on his
                            conversations with U.N. Secretary- General <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U
                                Thant</persName> and indicated he expected Indonesia to be formally
                            re-seated at the General Assembly by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.
                            In response to my questions and in the course of our conversation about
                            Indonesia's future U.N. role, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> stated that as part of its transition from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            leadership, which had favored the admission of Communist China to the
                            U.N., his government's delegation this year would abstain and thus
                            retreat from their previous position. He stated that he and his
                            government preferred a two-China policy in the U.N.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> stated that his
                            government desired to strengthen its relations with Taiwan and was, in
                            fact, entering into an agreement for Taiwan to process cotton to provide
                            Indonesian clothing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> made clear to me his
                            country's sympathetic understanding of the U.S. role in Asia and
                            Vietnam. He has instructed his government's representative in Cambodia
                            to try to open channels of communication to Hanoi. He stated that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s success in
                            defeating the Indonesian Communist forces was directly influenced by the
                            U.S. determination in South Vietnam. He too hoped for a negotiated
                            settlement to end the bloodshed and commended your heroic efforts in
                            this regard. But he made it clear that a U.S. withdrawal and a Communist
                            victory in Vietnam would be a direct threat to his country.</p>
                        <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> was uncertain as to how
                            effective a role his government could play in Vietnam. He deeply
                            regretted that his private conversations with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> of the Philippines as to
                            Indonesia's possible mediation role there was reported to the U.S. press
                            by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. He said this would set
                            back their efforts for the time being.</p>
                        <p>He and General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> understand
                            that with Indonesia's large population and great potential wealth they
                            could play a major future role in Asia and the U.N. They would like to
                            do this increasingly as a friend of the U.S. For the moment, however,
                            they are severely handicapped by a dire economic emergency. Their own
                            government's political stability depends upon their being able to
                            provide food and clothing for their people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, in response to my
                            question, agreed with the U.S. early reluctance to take the lead in
                            helping the new Indonesian government and thus possibly provide
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with
                            ammunition in that country's internal political struggle. Colonel
                            Soejono, however, speaking for General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, felt the concern was unwarranted. This was the
                            only difference between the two to manifest itself. Both, however, were
                            now eager for immediate aid.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, Indonesia requires large amounts of rice and is attempting
                            to obtain rice not only from the U.S. but also from Burma, Thailand and
                            some from Taiwan. They need much more from the U.S., however, than they
                            now have reason to believe they will receive.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia's cotton need is also great and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> referred to the U.S. overabundance of cotton. He
                            said Indonesia is eager not only for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            480 aid in cotton but would like to begin making commercial purchases
                            under long-term credits.</p>
                        <p>I suggested increased uses of wheat and bulgar, but was told that there
                            was a consumer resistance due to a lack of understanding and custom. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> agreed that it would be
                            in the long-term interest of Indonesia for wheat and bulgar to be
                            increasingly introduced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> emphasized that his
                            country's urgent rice and cotton needs were also essential to feed and
                            clothe the troops. With the ending of confrontation on the Malaysian
                            border and to keep the military from becoming restless, it was necessary
                            to keep the large numbers of troops in Indonesia satisfied and occupied.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> intends to turn
                            the army into a public works engineering corps to improve internal
                            transportation problems and undertake similar projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> hoped you would recognize
                            that his government has acted responsibly and expeditiously to help
                            itself and to play a responsible role in the world community. He pointed
                            to the ending of the confrontation in Malaysia and to the U.N.
                            readmission as examples. He also assured me that his government was
                            taking all proper steps to meet its economic problems.</p>

                                doubted that China would have permitted it. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> also discussed Indonesia's

                        <p>1. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that
                            Indonesia's principal short-range problem was providing adequate food
                            for its population and sufficient clothing for the Muslim Lebaran
                            holiday in December. He acknowledged the assistance which the United
                            States has already provided to help meet these needs. He went on to say
                            that it was not the size of foreign assistance that was important, but
                            rather the right kind of assistance that would help Indonesia's own
                            productive capacity to improve. Indonesia, the Minister continued, is
                            suffering from the legacy of the former regime and is saddled [with]
                            economic chaos. There is also, he added, a continuing residual threat
                            from Communist elements.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> had been discussing with the Foreign Minister
                            various kinds of emergency assistance which the United States was
                            prepared to furnish, and said that there was understanding and sympathy
                            for Indonesia's problems within our government. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the creditor nations are
                            organizing, he continued, for a cooperative effort to help Indonesia,
                            and we are ready to do our part. The Secretary stressed that external
                            resources could play only a marginal part in the development effort and
                            that Indonesia itself must carry the main burden. He cited the Alliance
                            for Progress in Latin America and United States assistance to India as
                            examples. In connection with the Tokyo meetings, the Secretary said that
                            in his talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in New York <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0512"/>he had expressed our views on
                            the importance of Soviet cooperation in a multilateral solution of
                            Indonesia's debt problems and emphasized that the creditors meeting
                            should in no sense be considered as an anti-Soviet conspiracy. Mr.
                            Gromyko, continued the Secretary, received these views without polemics,
                            but gave no indication of his government's position. The Secretary noted
                            the importance of non-discriminatory treatment of all of Indonesia's
                            creditors and said that any settlement that would imply payment of the
                            Soviet debt at the expense of the United States and other western
                            creditors would give us serious political problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said that he anticipated no
                            difficulty in obtaining Soviet cooperation; they had in fact little
                            choice but to accept the Tokyo principles.</p>

                        <p>1. After thanking the President for this opportunity to visit his office,
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> described
                            what he regarded as Indonesia's most significant steps forward in recent
                            months: Ending of Confrontation, entering into a constructive role in
                            Southeast Asia's regional affairs, resuming membership in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and its specialized agencies, as
                            well as participating in the <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0513"/>
                        <p>2. The President asked the Foreign Minister as to his views on what might
                            be done, that is not already being done, to bring peace to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. The Foreign Minister replied that his Government had had talks with
                            officials of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and other Asian
                            countries regarding Viet-Nam. He felt that all these countries had a
                            strong common stake in seeking peace for Viet-Nam. However, Indonesia
                            believes that any role which it could play in promoting peace should be
                            pursued quietly with minimum public notice. Indonesia would thus hope to
                            be in a position at the right time to exert a useful influence toward
                            resolving the conflict. Meanwhile, it was his view that South Viet-Nam
                            and its allies were left with no alternative but to maintain a strong
                            position in defending South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. As to the President's specific question about what the U.S. should or
                            should not be doing in Viet-Nam, the Foreign Minister said that his
                            country felt it was going to be difficult to reach any peaceful solution
                            as long as the bombings of North Viet-Nam continued. He nevertheless
                            recognized that North Viet-Nam is sending men and supplies to South
                            Viet-Nam so that it may be difficult for the U.S. to cease bombing of
                            installations related to these operations.</p>
                        <p>5. The President agreed with this latter observation, commenting that the
                            U.S. is prepared to stop the bombing if the other side halted its
                            aggressive actions. The President then inquired whether, in the Foreign
                            Minister's opinion, the Communists had been decisively beaten in
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>6. The Foreign Minister replied that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has suffered a major setback but it still retains
                            recovery capabilities which, if the new Government proves unable to
                            improve economic conditions, could well lead to a resurgence of
                            Communism. Thus, Indonesia's fundamental task is improvement of the
                            nation's economy.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to the President's inquiry as to what is being done to
                            cope with this problem, the Foreign Minister replied that his
                            Government's immediate need is food and clothing for the people,
                            reactivation of industries, infrastructure improvement, and above all,
                            overcoming the serious inflation now gripping Indonesia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> referred briefly to the
                            Government's stabilization program which is now getting underway and
                            which envisages a balanced budget in 1967 assuming an adequate amount of
                            new foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> elaborated on steps
                            which Indonesia is taking in the field of economic recovery. He
                            described the role of the Fund and the Bank in advising Indonesia on its
                            stabilization program, the outcome of the Tokyo meetings on debt
                            rescheduling, and the close cooperation we hope to achieve with other
                            countries in regard to future assistance to Indonesia.</p>
                        <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0514"/>
                        <p>9. The President said that he thought it most important that close
                            cooperation be maintained between Indonesia and those countries
                            providing assistance in order to make most effective use of all
                            resources, external and internal, required for Indonesia's economic
                            rehabilitation. He believed that these efforts should relate to a
                            specific rehabilitation and development plan drawn up in consultation
                            with a competent, objective authority such as the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. The President said he was watching developments in Indonesia with the
                            greatest interest, and he extended to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and his associates his best
                            wishes.</p>

                        <p>2007. Subject: Need for Military Assistance Program in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>1. Events of past several months clearly indicate that “new political
                            order” in Indonesia will be army planned, army built and army sponsored
                            and that it is army which will remain dominant political force in
                            Indonesia for a long time to come. We are pouching airgram which
                            discusses army plans for the “new Indonesia” in depth.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">Airgram A–210 from Djakarta, October 29. (Ibid.,
                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 2 INDON)</note> Following is
                            summary of our analysis:</p>
                        <p>A. Army has reached firm conclusion (which we share) that at present it
                            alone possesses the cohesiveness and leadership necessary to establish
                            “new political order” in Indonesia. Army also believes that failure on
                            its part to take initiative would lead to political dissension and
                            direct threat to Indonesia's unity. Army has set itself deadline of
                            slightly less than two years to establish “new order,” which elections
                            scheduled to be held by July 1968 will confirm.</p>
                        <p>B. Army's basic goal during interim period is to establish stable and
                            responsible administration. It will seek to do this by broadening
                            popular participation in government while maintaining strong central <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0515"/>control. In short, it will
                            attempt to find middle road between pitfalls of Sukarno's authoritarian
                            regime and freewheeling political party activity of early 1950's. This
                            task, it believes, will require tight hand on reins.</p>
                        <p>C. Even after “new order” established, army will continue to exercise
                            what it regards as its “historical right” to remain in government arena
                            as separate political force. Army already holds overwhelming majority of
                            key posts in regional administration (in addition to powerful and wholly
                            military pepelrada structure); it is also becoming increasingly evident
                            in second echelons of central government and is moving deeper into key
                            national enterprises.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe army's assessment of role it must play is valid and that
                            its formula for “new order” is essentially right mixture for Indonesia.
                            In fact, there appears to be no workable alternative short of outright
                            military dictatorship which Suharto hopes to avoid. This means that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must contemplate working with an
                            army controlled government not only during two year transition period
                            but well into “new order.”</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to its essential function as architect of “new order,”
                            military must, for compelling political reasons, be given constructive
                            role in new society. Suharto has repeatedly emphasized in his talks with
                            me that the military must have a strong sense of mission directed
                            towards improving conditions of life in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>A. Useful activities must be provided for army personnel in order to help
                            curb corruption and to prevent army personnel from engaging in
                            hooliganism or unhealthy political activity. Constructive military
                            outlets could also mitigate trend towards military moving into all
                            sectors of government and economy.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> must also produce some
                            early and clearly visible progress towards improving people's lot in
                            order retain their confidence and ensure his own dominant role over
                            others who would move directly toward military junta. Civic action type
                            projects, aside from ultimate economic impact, can yield immediate
                            psychological profit demonstrating army's concern for public welfare.
                            Army, which has clearest command channels, most equipment, most readily
                            available manpower and one of largest pools of technical expertise, is
                            in best position to undertake projects of this nature.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> now lacks the resources,
                            particularly equipment, to fold the military into such constructive
                            operations in meaningful way. Meeting these requirements with
                            Indonesia's own foreign exchange resources would cut into other vital
                            projects and could easily create animosity toward the military for
                            removing funds from civilian sector.</p>
                        <p>5. US assistance for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            program would allow us to influence and strengthen the hands of those
                            who will be running this country for the next several years and who, in
                            harness with good civilian <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0516"/>leaders, are best qualified to do so. In short, this program would
                            give us multiple returns on a relatively small investment.</p>
                        <p>6. I therefore urge that a modest military assistance program be
                            instituted for Indonesia soonest. Such a program would include:</p>
                        <p>A. Spare parts, replacements and technical advice for Indonesian military
                            civic action program.</p>
                        <p>B. Military sales program to enable Indonesian military to buy certain
                            additional items which are compatible with their present role.</p>
                        <p>C. Selective non-combatant items to help improve morale within army and
                            strengthen position of General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his colleagues.</p>
                        <p>D. Training program along lines already envisaged to train key Indonesian
                            officers, especially in civic action field.</p>

                        <p>2. (C) As stated in the reference, there is no direct military
                            requirement for an Indonesian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.
                            Nevertheless, it appears prudent to implement a small <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to support the civic action endeavors
                            of the Indonesian Armed Forces. In this regard, Secretary Thompson has
                            presented a substantial case in support of his proposal.</p>
                        <p>3. (C) The illustrative program presented by the reference is adequate
                            for its purpose; however, the actual content of the program should be
                            subject to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> recommendation
                            and review by the Joint Chiefs <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0517"/>of Staff. Further, to provide $6 million in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would in all
                            likelihood result in the majority of the material and services being
                            provided in CY 1968 with some items of material not being received until
                            CY 1969. This two- to three-year delay is considered untimely and
                            possibly detrimental to its intended purpose.</p>
                        <p>4. (C) To provide timely assistance to Indonesia, it would appear that
                            requirements should be funded in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967.
                            It is believed that this can be done within funds that are, or will
                            become, available to the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> without reduction of individual country
                            programs, provided add-on requirements for Laos are included in the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 Department of Defense
                            supplemental appropriation. If this can be done, it is recommended
                            that:</p>
                        <p>a. A $6 million material and services program be provided under the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and that, for planning purposes, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            dollar guideline for Indonesia be established at $6 million.</p>
                        <p>b. If necessary, Indonesia be included within the Mundt Amendment in lieu
                            of one of the terminated countries, other than Japan.</p>

                                from Djakarta, December 1, Green reported on a meeting with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> on November 29 in
                                which <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> made a “strong
                                plea for immediate <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> assistance to
                                civic mission projects” on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and the Cabinet. Green suggested that in
                                view of the deteriorating political situation in Java, “major stakes
                                are involved in our response to this request.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. There is general agreement here on desirability assisting Indonesian
                            military at earliest feasible date in its civil reconstruction program.
                            We are willing examine not only <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> but
                            entire range U.S. assistance <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0518"/>capabilities, and commit available resources where they will meet
                            Indonesian priority needs.</p>
                        <p>2. As you have pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                            and military, our readily available resources are limited, and even if
                            committed to utmost, they could not satisfy unrealistic expectations
                            still apparently held in some quarters, nor have significant impact on
                            vast complex of politico-social problems in East and Central Java. For
                            psychological and political reasons, it is important that military
                            leaders have some tangible evidence of our backing, but it seems
                            realistic accept from outset that we cannot provide more than token
                            support to an effort which must be essentially Indonesian in conception
                            and execution.</p>
                        <p>3. Necessity for small program also meets <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s request we keep program on modest scale and
                            examine carefully what military is already doing in civic mission field.
                            He appears reflect growing civilian concern that any substantial direct
                            foreign assistance to dominant clientele group could strengthen forces
                            tending separate military from civilian society.</p>
                        <p>4. Accepting necessity and desirability for small program, basic
                            practical problem is relating feasible U.S. contributions to Indonesian
                            needs. As it has emerged from your conversation with Malik and the
                            Generals reported reftel, and in previous talks with ARMA and Chief
                                <gloss target="#t_DLG1">DLG</gloss>, Army's civic action program is
                            still in blueprint stage with substantial support needs expressed in
                            general terms unrelated to specific missions and projects. All
                            conversations have carried unspoken but clear indication that
                            implementation is awaiting commitment U.S. resources and U.S. planning
                            assistance and feasibility studies. Difficult to reconcile this apparent
                            inactivity with urgency reflected in Hartono statements. Indo Army has
                            had 16 years experience and number of conspicuous successes in
                            independently conceived and executed civic action projects, and needs
                            little guidance in this field. Such projects are inherently labor
                            intensive, and despite recognized shortages, there should be sufficient
                            hand tools and other items of equipment available to get projects
                            underway without outside assistance. Even modest beginning should bring
                            desired political and psychological impact. Indonesian military has in
                            past shown impressive level professional competence in coping with
                            logistic support of two major military campaigns in most distant islands
                            of archipelago, and we believe it should be able to begin program of
                            road repair, irrigation works re- habilitation and other basic civil
                            jobs on central island of Java that would not require extensive use of
                            motorized equipment. Believe we should continue to underline strongly
                            your statement (para 4 reftel) that Army should press ahead with needed
                            programs regardless of outside help.</p>

                        <p>5. Experience in U.S. supported 1963–64 civic action program provides
                            clear evidence that U.S. assistance was most effective when it
                            backstopped and supported established individual projects already in
                            progress. Participation in planning, or giving feasibility advice on
                            plans still on drawing board, carries with it implied commitment, and
                            when we become involved in either process, Indonesians tended to shift
                            to us both the burden of providing resources as well as the
                            responsibility for success or failure. Necessity of small program as
                            well as desirability require Army move ahead on its own, indicate
                            clearly that our initial assistance should be restricted to support of
                            projects already underway, and that we should not become involved in
                            planning or feasibility studies.</p>
                        <p>6. On basis foregoing you may reply to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> along following lines:</p>
                        <p>a. We wish to do what we can to help military in its civic mission.</p>
                        <p>b. The resources that we can make available are limited and we believe
                            they could best be utilized in support of projects already underway.</p>
                        <p>c. We would like to examine such projects, and in consultation with
                            Indonesian military, attempt to relate priority needs with our
                            capabilities to help. At an appropriate time, we would be prepared to
                            send several military engineering specialists to survey equipment. </p>

                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his anti-Communist
                            military and civilian coalition are clearly in charge in Indonesia and
                            are likely to remain so, at least for the next year or two. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s influence is
                            declining steadily, he is still a major preoccupation of the regime, an
                            obstruction in its daily work, and a source of political embarrassment.
                            During 1967, however, he will probably be stripped of all effective
                            political power, retaining at most the ability to offer occasional
                            encouragement to frustrated leftist elements.<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">In Intelligence Memorandum No. 0794/67, February

                                that, “Isolated armed incidents by pro-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> elements are likely if

                                for opposition would be East Java where Sukarno still had support
                                among the marines, police, and the general population, and possibly
                                Central Java, North Sumatra and even Djakarta. Long-term dissidence
                                was unlikely. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country

                        <p>B. With the Communist Party already destroyed as an effective force in
                            today's politics, the neutralization of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would greatly improve the outlook for political
                            stability in Indonesia. Nevertheless, there will still be major problems
                            of adjustment. Civilian politicians will be in conflict with military
                            leaders reluctant to share power. And the mass parties of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era will have to compete
                            for influence with resurgent and reformist political elements closer to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s “new order.”</p>

                        <p>C. The Indonesian economy cannot quickly recover from a decade and more
                            of ruinous mismanagement, but it is probable that economic conditions
                            will at least cease to deteriorate and begin to improve within a year or
                            two. If foreign assistance continues at high levels and government
                            administration becomes more effective, an economic upturn could probably
                            be sustained until 1970. The need for foreign economic assistance—which
                            can only be expected to come from the US, Japan, and Western
                            Europe—virtually assures continuation of Indonesia's new Western-leaning
                            foreign policies.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reviewed the
                            situation in Indonesia that led up to the revolution of 1965. He pointed
                            out that American experts like Guy Pauker (Rand Corporation) had
                            concluded by 1965 that Indonesia was definitely going Communist.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had announced in
                            1965 that Indonesia was going to form a Djakarta-Peking Axis. The
                            Indonesian Communist Party (the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>)
                            launched its coup at the time it did in 1965 because although it was
                            steadily increasing its influence in Indonesia, it feared the death of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who was long
                            rumored to be seriously ill. At that time it was estimated that the PKI
                            had 3 million members and approximately 25 million supporters in various
                            front groups throughout Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>In the coup the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> aimed to eliminate
                            seven top generals in the army. They ultimately succeeded in killing
                            five of these, but two—the most important, Nasution and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>—escaped. The Communists <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0522"/>had by 1965 penetrated the Air
                            Force, Navy and some of the police. The Marines were also sympathetic.
                            The Army was the staunch bulwark against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, although certain parts of the Army had also been
                            penetrated. Given this pattern of infiltration, the situation in
                            Indonesia in 1965 was fragile and precarious. Had there been an external
                            threat to Indonesia from the North, and had the United States not taken
                            a strong position in Southeast Asia by that time, the PKI would have
                            been strengthened. The generals who ultimately triumphed would have been
                            gravely weakened in the estimate of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The reaction to the coup launched by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was indeed a bloody one and most reliable estimates
                            indicate that 300 to 400 thousand Indonesians were slain. The manner in
                            which the generals of the Army were slain inflamed the peasants and the
                            people. A special corps of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> women had
                            been trained to slash the generals to death—which they did. When
                            photographs of the slain generals were circulated around the Island, the
                            reaction against the local Communists was intense. They were already
                            unpopular because of their harassment of religious groups such as the
                            Moslems, and because they had taken over much of the power in local
                            areas. The result was a blood bath in which many of the Communists were
                            killed.</p>
                        <p>By November and December of 1965 the Army consolidated its position. But
                            it decided to let <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            stay around. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made a
                            counter-bid for power in January, February and March of 1966. It was at
                            that time that the students went into the streets to demonstrate against
                            Sukarno. During this period of demonstration the United States Embassy
                            was attacked on March 8, 1966. At this time <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> made a very shrewd move in the opinion of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. He informed
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in March that his
                            life was in danger because the students were marching on the Palace. He,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, could not protect
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s life unless
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was given full powers.
                            Only then did <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> get full
                            powers. But he nevertheless did not remove <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at that time in part
                            because he feared a reaction in Java where <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had a strong following.
                            Also <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> provided a
                            common enemy which welded all groups together.</p>
                        <p>By early 1967, however, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                            his colleagues had decided that it was time to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. They will try to remove
                            him soon, but hopefully he will resign voluntarily before the meeting of
                            the top leadership now scheduled for March 8th. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will fight back and of
                            course will allege that many of those against him are implicated in a
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> plot. That is his standard
                            routine. In the view of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not likely to survive this time.</p>
                        <p>Viewing the members of the present Government, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> commented that the Sultan of
                            Djakarta is a nice man, but not too powerful. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is astute and clever and works hard at governing
                                <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0523"/>Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> is one of the cleverest men he had
                            ever met. He is particularly clever in tactics. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> single-handedly brought an end to
                            the confrontation on Malaysia and brought Indonesia back into the United
                            Nations. However, he has no independent political base. He has a good
                            relationship with Suharto, but he is nevertheless fearful of too great a
                            military influence in the Government. This is a problem for him as
                            Foreign Minister because too many of the Ambassadorships are going to
                            military men, which weakened his own position in the Foreign
                            Ministry.</p>
                        <p>There is an important problem of keeping the military happy in Indonesia.
                            Because assistance was discontinued by most external powers, the
                            Indonesian Navy has had to mothball the fleet. Many other installations
                            have been cut back. The consequence is that there are many military men
                            available who have to get jobs. Suharto knows that he has to modify the
                            military set-up, but he doesn't want the military to absorb too much
                            power itself. He is purging the Air Force slowly and is moving gradually
                            to make certain of the loyalty of the Army. He wants to have an
                            absolutely sure base in the Army first before moving to “purify” the
                            rest of the armed forces. He also realizes the need at some point to
                            form a political party, but he wants to develop a stable base in the
                            Army first.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is intent on setting up
                            civic action programs to divert the energies of the military in solving
                            the problems of his own country. On May 26th Suharto asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> for assistance to do a
                            long list of things in the civic action field. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> suggested that foreign enterprise
                            could do many of the things that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> suggested his own military do. He stated that
                            some military assistance however is desirable, perhaps $6 million plus
                            another $2 million for spare parts. In his view, as he reported it to
                            Suharto, the Indonesian military should concentrate on the food problem.
                            The military have grandiose ideas of what is needed. Nevertheless,
                            although we cannot respond to their full request, we can give some
                            assistance. In dispensing aid, timing is extremely important. He sensed
                            that the Indonesian military are becoming impatient because we have not
                            responded to their recent requests.</p>
                        <p>Responding to the Vice President's question, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> said he talked to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> about Indonesia in
                            September of 1966. The Vice President described his contacts with the
                            Indonesians going back to 1949. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> was one of those who had visited the United States
                            at that time. The Vice President had managed to keep in touch with Malik
                            and some of his friends over a long period of time. The Vice President
                            had talked to Prime Minister Sato of Japan about Indonesia when he
                            visited Japan in January of 1966. He stated that he hoped Japan could be
                            ready to help if needed, because the United States <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0524"/>would not be able to move in there for
                            political reasons. The Vice President said he had had further
                            discussions about Indonesia when he went to Thailand in February of
                            1966, where members of his party had contacts with representatives of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he understood perfectly well why a man like
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> must keep the military
                            happy. We must understand this fact and he was sure that the President
                            was sensitive to it. He knew that the President had a very high regard
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> and great
                            admiration for the role he has played there in the last year and a half.
                            He noted the great timidity in the United States Government on the
                            question of Indonesia and a lack of interest in some circles. There had
                            been a National Security Council meeting in the summer of 1966 on this
                            subject, the meeting called chiefly at the request of <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> and the Vice President.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he readily agreed with the Ambassador that
                            the timing of our action is important just as the timing of inaction is
                            important. He appreciates the “low posture” which the Ambassador and the
                            United States Mission has taken in Djakarta in the past year and a half.
                            If the Ambassador believes that further action is now needed, he must
                            really press his case here in Washington. In the Vice President's view,
                            he should make the case directly to the President. The President is very
                            much interested in Indonesia, both for itself and also as a dividend of
                            the stand that the United States is taking in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out that United States influence is apparent in
                            Indonesia and that our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs have
                            borne fruit. For example, General Suharto regularly consults five
                            economists in preparing for major economic decisions. All of these
                            economists were trained in United States universities, three at
                            Berkeley, one at Harvard and one at <gloss target="#t_MIT1">MIT</gloss>.
                            Similarly, our military training program has proved to be a great
                            success and many of the people who both launched the coup and are in key
                            positions of power today, were trained in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated that
                            Indonesia must first deal with the resolution of its debt problem. Then
                            we can focus on the foreign aid problem. There is a question of how much
                            Indonesia can absorb at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President agreed that the economic and social development
                            program needs careful appraisal. We must not rush into a bilateral
                            program before we have explored the possibilities of channelling aid
                            multilaterally, before the consortium of nations has made its appraisal.
                            Nevertheless, we must not lose sight of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> must take care of the Army. We
                            must have a civic action program to put them to work and keep them busy.
                            For this modest amount of goods and <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0525"/>money is needed, and can do a lot of good in helping
                            Suharto at this time.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had resisted
                            this previously but was now prepared to change his mind. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had sent out a team which
                            would be bringing back an evaluation shortly.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he hoped the Pentagon would do better in regard
                            to Indonesia than it did on Laos. It had taken an unconscionable amount
                            of time to get aid in Laos and he hoped that this would not be true of
                            Indonesia. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> noted
                            that nothing had been delivered yet in the civic action field although
                            he expected something would be. As of this date, they are waiting for
                            the report of the Pentagon team. He added that in his view the State
                            Department had never fully understood the need for civic action
                            assistance, such as quartermasters' supplies, and spare parts.</p>
                        <p>Discussing the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program there the
                            Ambassador stated that what is most important is not only how much we
                            give but the way we give it. When we have a large <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> staff and a large <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> staff this results in a huge presence
                            which breathes down the neck of Indonesians. They feel they are being
                            treated like a client. The Ambassador's policy has been to reduce the
                            United States presence generally, not only with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> but with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and
                            other agencies. He advocates having no libraries under <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> auspices. Given the situation there
                            and the staff presence that would be necessary, this would be
                            counter-productive. He would rather spend the money on the books and
                            place them in Indonesian libraries leaving them with the
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>In general, he would place more responsibility on the Indonesian
                            Government. We have ways of checking up on them in the end. He said that
                            Administrator Bill Gaud and his Deputy-designate Rud Poats agree. But
                            the lower echelons of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have other
                            habits acquired over a long period of time. The question of style, of
                            how one does this is so important. It is not just a question of policy.
                            He believes that the success that the United States has had in Indonesia
                            is due to the fact that we cut down on our profile. Also there were very
                            few if any statements here by United States public officials about
                            Indonesia. During the past year and a half he has tried to have his
                            Embassy be just one more Embassy in Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>We are now starting again with a new slate. In his view we should have
                            some aid but we want to begin right. He has four <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials now and he hoped to go up to not more than
                            13. He definitely wants to hold it down.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that this certainly coincided with his approach
                            and that of the President of trying to emphasize a multilateral approach
                            to foreign aid, trying to get others to help share the burden. <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0526"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> concurred, stating that our
                            overwhelming presence in countries like Indonesia invariably creates
                            resentment. Another reason why they have been successful in the past
                            year and a half is because Indonesia has been spared the usual influx of
                            visitors from the United States and other countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> stated that he was
                            aware of the desire in February of 1966 of some officials in Washington
                            (the Vice President included himself in this) to begin assistance to
                            Indonesia then. The Ambassador stated that he was inclined to favor it
                            at this time, but he was counseled by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> “not yet.” He checked it out and found that
                            Nasution and Suharto concurred in that recommendation at that time. In
                            May <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> informed him that the
                            time was right and that they wanted aid. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reported that they were able to
                            put together an emergency package and they got it out there on time. It
                            made a terrific impact because it was on time.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President repeated that he hoped that the Ambassador would have
                            a chance to talk to the President before he departed for Djakarta. He
                            said he would contact <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>
                            in this regard and if he had an opportunity would talk to the President
                            about it himself.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This proposal is based on an estimate that Indonesia will require
                            $210–$240 million in total aid this year if it is to carry out its
                            stabilization program. Our portion of the total would be no more than
                            one-third, up to a maximum of $85 million.</p>
                        <p>We have already committed $36 million in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 funds this
                            year. The remaining $49 million would be a mix: $30–$40 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 and $10–$20 million in support
                            assistance. The amount, commodity composition and terms will be worked
                            out in the interagency review.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds will be limited to procurement
                            in the United States to minimize any adverse effect on our balance of
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the new Indonesian leadership has been fighting an uphill
                            battle to undo the damage of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s years of misrule. They have worked closely
                            with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> in laying out their plans
                            for the future. Our specialists consider those plans to be
                            realistic.</p>
                        <p>But they do need help, from us and from others.</p>
                        <p>The potential aid donors will be meeting in Amsterdam on February 23–24.
                            This is a follow-up to the debt re-scheduling conference in Paris last
                            December.</p>
                        <p>Our delegation wants authority from you to discuss this with the
                            Indonesians and others on the basis of a pledge from us of up to
                            one-third of the total requirement, i.e. no more than $85 million (of
                            which $36 million has already been committed).</p>
                        <p>The Amsterdam meeting is not, strictly speaking, a pledging session. But
                            our State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials believe that
                            this vital aid program will not move as it should if we can make no
                            pledges or talk in terms of what we can be expected to provide. They
                            consider it most important that they have the authority as outlined
                            above.</p>
                        <p>I asked for a reading of sentiment on the Hill. Bill Bundy discussed the
                            Indonesian problem on January 18 with the Foreign Affairs Committee. He
                            reports that the members viewed with understanding our efforts to help
                            Indonesia and to take part in lending support to the new leadership.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> had a 90-minute
                            session with the Foreign Relations Committee on January 30. He said the
                            members welcomed the multilateral approach in meeting Indonesia's needs
                            and endorsed our participation in a program to afford Indonesia
                            critically <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0528"/>needed assistance.
                            In separate sessions, Senator Mansfield, Congressman Morgan and
                            Congressman Zablocki voiced full agreement to our giving timely
                            assistance to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>I believe the requested authority should be granted on the basis of the

                                memorandum <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> asked the
                                President if he wished to meet with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> for “a quick but thorough
                                outline of the problems we now face.” <persName>Johnson</persName>
                                instructed <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to “debrief
                                him &amp; give me 1 page memo on high points.” (Ibid.)</note> I
                            had a useful talk with <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall
                                Green</persName>. He underlined the following in discussing
                            Indonesia today:</p>
                        <p>1. Our efforts in Viet-Nam had a definite and favorable impact on
                            developments in Indonesia. General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> could not have reacted <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0529"/>as he did to the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-Communist coup if a serious
                            threat from the North had existed. Our involvement in Viet-Nam is part
                            of our total posture in the area—with favorable effects in Indonesia and
                            elsewhere. However, we should avoid public discussion of the effect on
                            Indonesian internal developments.</p>
                        <p>2. On Communist China, recent developments confirmed the Indonesian view
                            that Peking's policy was wrong and “ideological absurd- ity” (Maoism).
                            The Indonesians feel more secure. They also have more confidence in us,
                            because only we really oppose Peking's policy.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will be out of
                            power, probably soon. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has
                            wisely followed the constitutional path in cutting back <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s power. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has destroyed himself.</p>
                        <p>4. The new government is working for the people. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and Co. feel they have to win;
                            their lives are on the line. Failure will mean their destruction. The
                            Communists will try to pay back the blood debt. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> sees some risk of the military
                            overriding the civilians politically, and will advise against this
                            course.</p>
                        <p>5. The government is pursuing a pragmatic economic policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">In Intelligence Memorandum <gloss target="#t_RR1">RR</gloss>

                                for Economic Development in Indonesia,” the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concluded that the economic situation in Indonesia
                                would improve over the next 2 to 3 years. The speed of recovery
                                depended “not only on the level of foreign aid but also on the
                                progress in establishing an orderly state administration and a more
                                stable environment for private enterprise.” (Ibid.)</note> Green
                            notes that the five leading economists in Indonesia on whom <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his colleagues rely were all
                            trained in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. Main problems of the new regime:</p>
                        <p>—to maintain the unity of the new order;</p>
                        <p>—to get going on economic progress. <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> notes progress is debt-rescheduling. Now, we
                            should push economic assistance. (The plan for U.S. help, in cooperation
                            with other donors, is on your desk;<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> thinks the proposal is
                            minimal. It is important we be forthcoming with the Indonesians: (1) to
                            give them needed assurance; (2) to stimulate others to help more.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia faces severe problems; prices have been rising. There is rising
                            popular discontent. Any evidence we are going to help will be heartening
                            in Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> was pleased that we are
                            moving fast in the civic action field through <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. This is “relatively minor, but crucial.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has two concerns about the immediate future:</p>
                        <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>1) Can we give enough fast enough to help the Indonesians out of their
                            current troubles?</p>
                        <p>2) Can we help in ways that will minimize frictions and maximize our
                            political advantage? The Ambassador would like to see less red tape in
                            aid administration. He would put heavier responsibilities on recipient
                            governments rather than looking over their shoulders at every turn. He
                            understands Congressional pressure on this, and that we cannot make one
                            country an exception. He notes that present procedures require large AID
                            missions, which he considers self-defeating politically.</p>
                        <p>Overall, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> thinks:</p>
                        <p>—there have been tremendous changes in Indonesia;</p>
                        <p>—things are going to get better;</p>
                        <p>—Indonesia is a vitally important “swing” country in Asia;</p>
                        <p>—the important thing is to consolidate the gains that have been made—to
                            not let things slip backward. </p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government wants to play a more important role in Indonesia.
                            There is resistance in the Finance Ministry and the Diet. He is worried
                            Japan won't do as much as it should. He will consult with the Japanese
                            on his way back to Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>There is significant Japanese private interest in investment. The
                            Indonesian and Japanese economies are complementary.</p>
                        <p>The Australians should be doing more in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch are playing the most constructive role of all the
                            Europeans.</p>
                        <p>During his leave, <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> spoke to 30
                            important private groups around the country, audiences up to 500. He
                            spoke “off the record” for the most part, and was able to stress the
                            importance of our Viet-Nam action for Indonesia and for Asia. He
                            strongly supported our policy in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>He leaves tomorrow morning, unless you wish to see him.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s assumption of the
                            powers of the Presidency has dramatized the significant shift in
                            Indonesia's political orientation that has been taking place during the
                            past sixteen months. This shift began on October 1, 1965, when the
                            Indonesian Army, led by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, put down a Communist-inspired coup d'etat and
                            then proceeded to eliminate the three million member Indonesian
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) as an effective
                            political organization. Having crushed the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, the Army turned to the more difficult job of stripping
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of
                            political power and reorienting Indonesian foreign policy away from
                            close association with Peking and toward accommodation with its
                            neighbors and the United States. This process appears now to be entering
                            its final stage; the Indonesian Army is nearing complete control of the
                            Indonesian Government.</p>
                        <p>I believe that our Military Assistance Program to Indonesia during the
                            past few years contributed significantly to the Army's anticommunist,
                            pro-U.S. orientation and encouraged it to move against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> when the opportunity was presented.
                            That the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was acutely aware of this
                            instinctive opposition in the Army is shown by the fact that five of the
                            six Army generals assassinated by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> on that fateful October 1 had received training in U.S.
                            Army schools and were known friends of the United States. Moreover,
                            after the Army had put down the revolt, the key jobs went to
                            U.S.-trained officers. Suharto himself is not U.S.-trained, but all
                            thirteen top members of his staff, the group that now governs Indonesia,
                            received training in the United States under the Military Assistance
                            Program. In my judgment, our decisions to invest roughly $5 million to
                            bring some 2100 Indonesian military personnel to the United States for
                            training, and to continue the program even <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0532"/>during the bleak years 1963–65 when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was carrying on
                            confrontation against Malaysia and working closely with Peking, have
                            been very significant factors in determining the favorable orientation
                            of the new Indonesian political elite.</p>
                        <p>Our total <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to Indonesia from 1950
                            through 1965 was $63.2 million. Roughly $59 million was given in the
                            years 1959–1965. Two-thirds of this ($40 million) went to the Army and
                            included over 100,000 small arms, some 2,000 trucks and other vehicles,
                            and tactical communications equipment. When <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> began his confrontation
                            against Malaysia in 1963, we eliminated from the program items that
                            contributed to Indonesia's offensive capability, but we continued to
                            supply small arms for support of the Army's internal security
                            capability.</p>
                        <p>In 1962 we expanded the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to include
                            engineering equipment for the Army's civic action program. A total of $3
                            million of such equipment was delivered between 1962 and 1964. The civic
                            action program was the brainchild of General Nasution (now Chairman of
                            the Consultative Assembly) and General Yani (one of the generals killed
                            by the Communists in October 1965) who believed the Army needed programs
                            that would improve its image with the Indonesian people vis-à-vis the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Another aspect of the civic
                            action program was to bring key younger Army officers to the United
                            States for training (at Harvard, Syracuse, and several other
                            institutions) to prepare them for high level management
                            responsibilities. This training proved to be of great value when the
                            Army assumed control of the government.</p>
                        <p>We suspended shipments of new equipment to Indonesia in September 1964.
                            In March 1965 we cancelled the remainder of the program, except the
                            training of those Indonesians already in the United States. Roughly $23
                            million for equipment, services, and training was cancelled, and the
                            funds were subsequently recouped. However, we maintained close contact
                            with the Indonesian Army leadership through our military attaches and
                            our Defense Liaison Group, which was retained on a skeletal basis even
                            after the termination of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In September 1966, when the Army had isolated Sukarno and formally ended
                            confrontation against Malaysia, we resumed the military training program
                            for Indonesian officers (at a cost of $400,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67). The primary emphasis of this training is on
                            increasing the civic action capability of the Indonesian Armed Forces.
                            During this past week, we have decided to increase the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> by
                            $2 million in order to provide spare parts for previously supplied
                            engineering equipment and also some new equipment—all for the civic
                            action program. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 we plan to give
                            Indonesia $6 million in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, primarily
                            for support of the civic action program.</p>
                        <p>It would be presumptuous to claim that our military assistance and
                            training were solely responsible for the anticommunist orientation <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0533"/>of the Indonesian Army, or even
                            that they were the major factors in causing the Indonesian Army to turn
                            against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and swing Indonesia away
                            from its pro-Peking orientation. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that
                            these programs, together with our continued sympathy and support for the
                            Army, encouraged its leaders to believe that they could count on U.S.
                            support when they turned on the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and,
                            later, against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Our
                            firm policy in Vietnam has also played a part in forming Army attitudes
                            favorable to our objectives in Southeast Asia. A year and a half ago,
                            Indonesia posed an ominous threat to the U.S. and the Free World. Today,
                            the prospect is dramatically altered for the better. General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s government is steering
                            Indonesia back toward a posture that promises peace and stability in
                            Southeast Asia.</p>

                            Situation.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss> session just concluded
                            represents what is probably significant turning point for Indonesia. Not
                            only has all effective power been formally removed from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">According to telegram 4239 from Djakarta,
                                March 13, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was sworn in
                                as Acting President at 10:45 p.m. on March 12 after the People's
                                Consultative Assembly—Provisional (<gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss>) accepted by acclamation that afternoon a decree
                                withdrawing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                                mandate. (Ibid.)</note> but of even greater importance for future of
                            this country, basis has been laid for more healthy relationship among
                            political elements. Civilians stood up and fought for what they believed
                            in and military, to its credit, let them do so and in fact met many of
                            their demands. Victory of civilian forces and “hawks” within military
                            was not, however, so lopsided as to encourage them in future to
                            challenge executive without good cause. Through it all, Suharto again
                            showed his sincere dedication to democratic means (at any point he could
                            have moved in and imposed solution), his ability to juggle <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0534"/>political forces and his skill in
                            gaining consensus for his actions. These traits will be invaluable as he
                            tackles difficult tasks ahead. Following is our estimate of major
                            political steps in months ahead as Indonesia moves toward elections
                            scheduled for mid-1968.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not foresee an early crystallization of political forces into
                            lasting coalitions on order of that evolving in MPRS session. On
                            contrary, we expect constant shifting of political alliances as issues
                            succeed each other. Moslems may at points be pitted against secularists
                            and Christians. Two giant Javanese parties (<gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>) may form
                            tactical and temporary alliances against outer-island organizations.
                            Political parties will find themselves united at times against military
                            with action fronts in swing position. Finally military itself will
                            probably divide occasionally on certain issues with each faction picking
                            up different civilian allies. This type of political kaleidoscope suits
                            well Suharto's political technique. He works largely as “loner” and in
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> campaign
                            proved himself adept at juggling political forces.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, of course,
                            represented only first of many issues which will eventually determine
                            nature of new regime. In his speech accepting <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss> mandate, Acting President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> placed most emphasis on general elections as
                            culminating test for new order. We suspect that both political and
                            economic activities will now focus in large part on this distant
                            event.</p>
                        <p>A. First on agenda for parliament is government's electoral package
                            (bills on parties, parliament's composition and election system). These
                            bills will probably stimulate heated debate. <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> will join <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> in
                            fighting single-member constituency system, and parties as whole will
                            probably seek maintain unaffiliated functional group representation in
                            general and military contingent in particular at present level. <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>'s attached to action fronts may side with
                            military on some of these issues. We expect that customary Indonesian
                            compromise will be reached involving perhaps combination of single
                            member constituency and proportional representation systems.</p>
                        <p>B. Parties will press hard for portfolios in cabinet, which are important
                            source of funds and patronage needed to wage election campaign. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> may be forced to give
                            a little, we suspect that he will maintain principle of “working
                            cabinet” leaving parties largely restricted to representative bodies.
                            Cabinet reshuffle may well occur within next few months but will
                            probably be aimed more at increasing cabinet's efficiency than
                            satisfying political party demands. Such figures as <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> and Sultan seem safe, although
                            latter may be bolstered by appointment of qualified technicians to some
                            economic portfolios.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> in particular and armed
                            forces in general are also “running” in coming election. Their showing,
                            as <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is well aware, depends
                            on success of Ampera cabinet. We can expect <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0535"/>other parties to attempt discreetly
                            exploit any lack of progress in economic sector, particularly if they
                            have been unsuccessful in obtaining cabinet posts. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> will thus continue concentrate
                            on his economic program, increasing pressures on foreign governments to
                            contribute. Ironically, lack of progress in this sector may well prolong
                            cabinet's life as <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                            military will be unwilling face election unless and until adequate
                            progress has been made.</p>
                        <p>D. We expect election to be postponed for six months or year at least,
                            ostensibly on administrative grounds, and few should genuinely object.
                            Postponement will apparently require reconvening of <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss>, probably month or two before present
                            election deadline (July 1968).</p>
                        <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s primary
                            political base will remain the armed forces and we believe that he will
                            [do] more to strengthen his hold over military services.</p>
                        <p>A. Changes in top navy and police leadership is high on agenda. Suharto
                            perhaps hopes that Navy Minister Muljadi, Marine Commandant Hartono and
                            Police Minister Sutjipto will fall of their own weight once their
                            underlings assess their failure to influence significantly outcome of
                                <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss> session. After cooling off
                            period, Suharto might personally take hand in their ouster and perhaps
                            ask Adam Malik to cough up more Ambassadorial positions.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> may also seek reduce
                            political power of army hawks. He is especially wary of allowing
                            regional commanders to build up powerful political bases in non-Javanese
                            areas. General Dharsono is doing just that in West Java as is General
                            Solichin in South Sulawesi. They may be assigned to staff positions
                            along with Kostrad Chief of Staff Kemal Idris and <gloss target="#t_RPKAD1">RPKAD</gloss> Commander Sarwo Edhie. These shifts
                            will probably be done gradually and in manner not unduly harmful to
                            their military careers or alarming to their supporters.</p>
                        <p>C. Pressures will continue, especially from political parties, to
                            persuade Suharto to relinquish one or both of his military portfolios.
                            We suspect that he will not do so at least until he has accomplished
                            measures mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>5. Students may pose occasional problem for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. Military will now wish to put them back into
                            classes but they are understandably reluctant to disband successful
                            action front organizations. Accustomed to regarding themselves as voice
                            of people's conscience and cognizant that some cause is necessary to
                            keep their organizations intact, students may be tempted to take to
                            streets again to protest unpopular measures. In this eventuality they
                            would be pitted directly against the military and we do not rule out
                            clashes such as occurred on October 3. This threat, however, will
                            probably subside with time.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s long range concern is
                            latent threat from left. Additional military operations against isolated

                        <p>Dear Sam:</p>
                        <p>Many thanks for your letter of March 31<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s letter has not been
                                found, but the substantive points he made are repeated by <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>.</note> which set down in
                            helpful and stimulating style a series of formulations on the emerging
                            Indonesian political scene. We seem to be on the same wave length but
                            with enough tonal variations to stimulate further exchanges.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>In the interests of easy reference I have repeated each one of your
                            lettered paragraphs together with my comments on that paragraph.</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has shown an uncommon
                            political wisdom and shrewdness, as well as remarkable sense of timing
                            in handling <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and other
                            main problems of the last twenty months (confrontation, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the trials, etc.). He is the dominant
                            personality on the Indonesian scene and we see no one of comparable
                            stature who could lead Indonesia in the difficult months and years
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had to be pushed by <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> on handling confrontation, returning to the UN,
                            and other matters, although the handling of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was completely in
                            accordance with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s guiding
                            genius. I agree that Suharto has an inborn political sense which has
                            made him the man for the job these past 18 months, and I see no one who
                            is now capable of replacing him or who in fact aspires to do so.</p>
                        <p>b. His next effort must be to put together a more effective and honest
                            government to deal with the economic mess and to lay the foundation for
                            Indonesia's political future.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I agree. However, we should not expect
                            wholesale cabinet changes which would open up new problems of political
                            party representation in the cabinet. It would be in <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s style to avoid this until
                            after elections, meanwhile making changes from time to time in cabinet
                            and sub-cabinet positions to remove the more obvious corruptionists or
                            incompetents. But I see no cleansing of the Augean stables on the heroic
                            Herculean scale.</p>
                        <p>c. An early return to “normal politics”, i.e., to more or less the old
                            political parties, to an election based on them, and to a government
                            created from them, would solve no problems in Indonesia. It would not
                            give Indonesia effective government, would only lead to disgust with the
                            democratic process, produce more chaos, and probably end in a complete
                            takeover by the military.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Concur. I am sure that elections will
                            not be held until Indonesia's rehabilitation is well under way and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is certain that the
                            outcome of the elections will not overthrow the “new order” or seriously
                            challenge its progress. On the other hand I do not see <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> removing the old parties. He may
                            in fact seek a political solution that involves efforts to gain support
                            of old parties or major elements thereof for his “New Order”.</p>
                        <p>d. For <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> to assume that he can
                            build a new political party on a civilian base with any chance of
                            success, is sheer romancing. He is not that strong politically, nor is
                            he likely to become so in view of his enemies and opposition in
                            religious, military, national and political circles.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: This may underrate <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>'s potential and also contradicts
                            to some extent the thrust of your paragraph h. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> has <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0538"/>been counted out before, only to bounce back to a
                            position of prominence. He may be weak as an organizer but I can
                            conceive of a number of circumstances under which he might rather
                            quickly emerge as a prominent political force within a coalition of
                            progressive elements.</p>
                        <p>e. For the military to withdraw from a major and active role in political
                            life would be as disastrous for Indonesia as for the military to take
                            over all power. However, it is not likely that the military will either
                            want to give up power, or dare to give up power, even if they so desire.
                            On the contrary, the greater danger is that the military will push for
                            more and more power. The problems for Suharto are to keep a strong rein
                            on power, enlist civilian cooperation, resist the pressures toward
                            exclusive military power, and weld a military-civilian team to govern
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I fully agree.</p>
                        <p>f. In short, the key to the future, to political stability, to effective
                            government, to a successful transition to elected government, is in
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s hands. If he can
                            make a success of the next year or two his government becomes the embryo
                            of the successor government, and he becomes the natural person to lead
                            the subsequent government. Whether Suharto realizes it or not, it would
                            seem that this would eventually require the creation of a new political
                            party which only he can lead. (This was the experience of General
                            Papagos in Greece in 1952, and General Pak in Korea in 1963.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: This is a possibility but there are
                            others. Ed Masters, for example, has suggested that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> may feel he can find a civilian
                            base for his government in a cleansed <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>. I rather suspect that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has not yet made up his mind on how to organize
                            political forces in order to insure perpetuation of his New Order. Most
                            signs at present would tend in the direction of his trying to achieve
                            this crucial goal through a combination of (a) guaranteed seats in the
                            Parliament for his military and Action Fronts on whose support he can
                            absolutely count, and (b) trying to gain the support of as many of the
                            political parties or factions thereof as possible. The political party
                            element is nevertheless likely to maintain a relative independence,
                            being prepared to vote either for or against government bills in
                            accordance with party interests.</p>
                        <p>As to your parenthetical comment about the Greek and Korean examples, I
                            am not sure how relevant Suharto would consider them to be. Would he be
                            willing to take the risk which Pak took in 1963 when Pak would have lost
                            to a more united opposition? I doubt it.</p>
                        <p>g. A new political party must have military support and a civilian base.
                            It must be able to draw in the new, young, eager, progressive civilian
                            and military forces who want change. It must also draw on <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0539"/>the younger and more progressive
                            elements of the old nationalist and religious parties.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It would be ideal if the new party would
                            attract the support of those groups you mentioned, but this is Indonesia
                            where actual performance would likely fall far short of that ideal.
                            Comments on paragraph f. above also relevant.</p>
                        <p>h. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> is the natural leader of
                            the young civilian progressive elements, but he cannot get very far
                            without Suharto and military support. He must therefore aim at an
                            alliance under <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> begins to think of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> as a competitor, or if
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> is unwilling to play a
                            supporting role to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, we see
                            little possibility of a collective leadership emerging that combines the
                            essential and most hopeful political elements, or one that offers
                            promise of avoiding the dangers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I agree. To all appearances <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> realizes he needs <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> more than <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> needs him. Yet <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> aspires to eventual greater power
                            than he now has, and if he is frustrated in achieving such power there
                            may be some question of whether he would be content to remain in harness
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. At present
                            relationships between <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> are good and one would
                            hope that the inevitable reactivation of politics will not destroy their
                            remaining in harness together. One step that might be helpful in
                            preserving such a relationship would be to name <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> as First Minister under Suharto,
                            which would in effect make <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s Deputy for all affairs,
                            including economic. (You will recall that Hassan mentioned this idea to
                            me and that I said I thought the idea very sound.)</p>
                        <p>i. One question is whether Suharto sees the shape of the future and his
                            role in it. We suspect that he already does. But if he does not, it
                            seems from here that he must eventually come to see his role, and the
                            course he must follow, because we see no alternatives that offer a
                            better hope for Indonesia. The second question is whether <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> understands it and is prepared to
                            play a subordinate role.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: These are both key questions on which I
                            can only grope for answers. In the economic field Suharto has acted as a
                            pragmatist, being single-minded and determined in the field of
                            stabilization, making no typical Javanese concessions or engaging in
                            musjawara. In the political field, however, he seems quite typically
                            Javanese in his approach, judging his position after allowing the
                            various political groups to show their hands and then looking for the
                            most comfortable point between extremes, provided that that point is not
                            inconsistent with his own longer range goals. So far, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s political strategy has also
                            involved: first, gaining the full united support of the Army; secondly,
                            winning the support of the other three Armed Services, or at least
                            neutralizing armed force elements like the KKO which were more loyal to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> than to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> moves towards the
                            promised elections, his tactics for insuring continuation of his new
                            order will be clarified. Right now, he lays primary stress on improving
                            the economic climate, but beyond that, he may not yet have formulated
                            any definite ideas. Since he cannot afford to let the Sukarnoists back
                            in, and since he has shown himself to be highly adept in political
                            strategy this past year, I am reasonably certain he will come up with a
                            plan of action best suited to gaining his goals of retaining power while
                            also maintaining as much unity as possible amongst the highly diverse
                            and squabbling political groups and elements that for so long have
                            plagued Indonesia. It seems to me that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s style will continue to be marked by efforts to
                            minimize abrasions and divisiveness, but I do not think he will carry
                            compromise so far as to endanger continuation of basic New Order
                            policies and programs. The penalty would be too great.</p>
                        <p>Just one or two additional points:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> seems increasingly
                            relaxed and to be enjoying his new role as Acting President. I regard
                            this as an additional reason why he may want to stay on in power. He has
                            some weaknesses (e.g. keeping on too many second-rate military cronies;
                            lack of adequate direction on the Chinese resident issue) but he has
                            strengths that are peculiarly relevant to leadership of a united
                            Indonesia in the post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            era.</p>
                        <p>2. You mention the complicated relationship between <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>. I believe that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> will be content to play second fiddle to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and he seems to have
                            little potential for effective organization including those from the
                            most extreme nationalist and religious groups. If this analysis is wrong
                            and Nasution should make a bid for power, I fully share your views about
                            where we should stand.</p>
                        <p>3. With further reference to paragraph h., I do not rule out the
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> might lead
                            a party which supported <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            New Order and in that capacity <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> might continue on in Suharto's post-election

                            support of International Monetary Fund. This support stems in turn from

                        <p>c. There has been circulating in Djakarta criticism that U.S. support of
                            Indonesian stabilization effort has been slow and niggardly. This
                            criticism difficult to understand in light of following facts. Since
                            April 1966 U.S. has postponed payment of $51 million of debt falling due
                            in 18 month period 1 July 1966 through 31 December 1967, and provided
                            $77 million in new aid. Included in this figure is direct assistance to
                            the Indonesian Armed Forces for its civic mission. The U.S. is further
                            committed to provide an additional $32 million as part of its share in
                            meeting its commitment at Amsterdam and Scheveningen. Total through
                            December 1967 of assistance to New Order will be therefore roughly $160
                            million.</p>

                            this stage the most we can do is to assure <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that we are keenly aware of Indonesia's
                            requirements, that Indonesia has a high priority, and that as early as
                            possible in the new crop year (beginning in July) we will let him know
                            whether we can help.</p>

                            that we had high regard for his professional competence. Widjojo then
                            explained that unspecified persons were circulating story that Hartono
                            was ineffective in dealing with Americans and that others could extract
                            more <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> from US. Persistence his

                        <p>1. Well over half of my three hour meeting alone (except for interpreter)
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> last night was
                            involved in trying to dispel <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s concern over US aid prospects for this and
                            next year. Balance of conversation was taken up with other aid matters,
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, foreign investment and foreign
                            policy issues. Our discussions on Vietnam and <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0544"/>other sensitive points already reported

                                from Djakarta, July 6, in which <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> briefed <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> on the meeting that his personal
                                representatives had with North Vietnamese Ambassador to Indonesia
                                Pham Binh who was currently in Hanoi. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> hoped that Pham Binh would return with
                                “something of interest to convey” and he would pass it on to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. Also discussed was
                                the Middle East and Indonesia's relations with the Soviet Union.

                            Vietnam and, I would judge, other areas as well. At no point was Suharto
                            anything but moderate, agreeable (though somewhat reserved) and
                            matter-of-fact. Main objective of my conversation was to form basis for
                            frequent continuing exchanges of views with man who is almost certainly
                            going to lead <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for sometime to come.
                            Uncertain whether I succeeded in that objective. To some extent this
                            will depend on practical results of our talk: i.e. our responsiveness to
                            his requests.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s Plea for US Support</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> began by saying that he
                            wanted to make it clear that he did not question our goodwill towards
                            Indonesia. He also recognized our world-wide commitments and the
                            problems every US administration faces in getting aid through Congress.
                            He seriously questioned, however, whether we attached sufficiently high
                            priority to Indonesia, bearing in mind its enormous problems including
                            challenge from Sukarnoist forces. Country faces a real emergency where
                            unusual steps are needed and where assistance of US, above all, vitally
                            needed. However there have been number of disturbing indications that US
                            does not see problems of Indonesia in same light. Certain recent US
                            actions did not reflect views expressed by high-ranking visitors from
                            Washington who had called on him this past year. Suharto had now just
                            learned from Widjojo, on his return from Washington, that no further
                            dollar loans likely this year, that US seeking to force unneeded and
                            unwanted PL480 sales on Indonesia in CY'67, and there was likelihood
                            that US assistance to Indonesia in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'68
                            will be limited to only $20 million in import loans with balance being
                            in PL480.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> continued that Ampera
                            cabinet program was drawn up on expectation of continuing US assistance.
                            “I have regarded US as potentially our greatest friend, but if I cannot
                            be sure of your assistance then I will have to make another plan.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> did not imply that he
                            would sell out to the Russians or anything like that, but he stated
                            bluntly that he would have to make some major adjustments in government
                            budget plans and programs which, coming to attention of Sukarnoists and
                            other hostile forces in Indonesia, would expose government to grave
                            danger. Damage could be irreparable.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Position </p>
                        <p>4. I said I was glad he was not questioning our motives or good faith. I
                            knew there had been many completely false rumors floating about
                            regarding our position. I had long wanted to see Suharto, if only to
                            make clear to him that we fully support his government and that our
                            efforts directed at maintaining unity of new order under his able
                            leadership. He was the one man who could [garble—pull?] country together
                            in these troublesome times, and we admired his moderation, pragmatism,
                            dedication to needs of the people, and desire to maintain balance
                            between military and civilian elements in government. I also spoke of
                            our high regard for his leading economic and foreign affairs advisors. I
                            said there were bound to be differences amongst friends but that these
                            were minor compared to our broad areas of common interest and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CY'67 Aid Mix </p>
                        <p>5. As to specific points which <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had raised re composition of our CY'67 program,
                            I reminded him of our Amsterdam statement forecasting that US assistance
                            would involve both PL480 and import loans. I was sure we would not force
                            unneeded PL480 on his government, but it nevertheless had been our
                            conclusion that raw cotton would be needed by the end of this year. If
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> disagreed, this matter should
                            certainly be discussed further between our experts. As far as rice was
                            concerned, I was authorized to tell him that we keenly aware of
                            Indonesia's requirements, that Indonesia had high priority and that as
                            early as possible in new crop year, beginning this month, we would let
                            him know whether we could help.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> again urged—as he had
                            two weeks ago through General Sudjono—that we provide as much PL480 rice
                            this calendar year as possible. This was critically needed. (He did not
                            mention possibility of receiving 76,000 tons of pearl rice which had
                            been communicated to Widjojo during latter's Washington talks.)</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said he wanted to make
                            it clear that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> welcomes PL480 sales,
                            not only rice, but also cotton and he even interested eventually in
                            possibility of wheat. In latter regard, he hoping to change national
                            diet habits, starting with Djakarta, so that bread is substituted for
                            rice on breakfast menu. He also keenly interested in reports of rice
                            substitutes which can be prepared in such way as to have appearance of
                            rice. However it was considered view of his government that for balance
                            of CY'67, Indonesia requires only PL480 rice and dollar import loans. It
                            will need 150,000 bales of raw cotton but not to arrive before April
                            '68. He was opposed to finished textiles since this would depress local
                            spinning and weaving industries. I said that our aid representative
                            returning from Washington July 6 and that we would pursue these <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0546"/>questions further with his
                            economic team. (Sadli subsequently phoned to say that he and Widjojo, at
                            Suharto's request, wish to see me July 8.) Suharto again underlined
                            crucial importance he attached to our aid mix being along lines
                            determined by Indonesia's needs rather than by our desires to dispose of
                            agricultural commodities but he recognized the need for and usefulness
                            of PL480 commodities in the aid mix.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CY'68 Program, Including Civic Mission </p>
                        <p>8. In responding to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            questions regarding prospective US aid in CY'68, I took occasion to run
                            down briefly our programs in CY'66 and CY'67, including debt relief,
                            budget support, other bilateral assistance and prospects for regional
                            assistance. As for CY'68, I said we would presumably be following same
                            formula with regard to coordinating with <gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss> countries on debt relief and providing our share of
                            total aid requirements as determined by <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Additionally I thought we could look for an expansion
                            in our support for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s civic
                            mission program, for food for work and technical assistance programs. I
                            took this occasion to give Suharto two papers outlining our civic
                            mission support for FY'67 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'68,
                            broken down by services (omitting dollar amounts).<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">Neither paper is identified further.</note> I told
                            him that, directly responsive to request he made last autumn, I now
                            authorized to state we will furnish “2,000 sets of uniforms and 32,000
                            jungle boots” for equipping all of military involved in civic mission
                            program. I spoke of our high regard for General Hartono and outstanding
                            manner in which civic mission program is now getting off the ground. I
                            shared Suharto's keenness for expanding civic mission program and I, for
                            one, would do all possible to help increase our assistance for civic
                            mission, assuming program continues to be pursued with same
                            effectiveness as had been shown so far.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for all we had done with regard to civic mission program, including
                            shoes and uniforms. There were two particular points, however, he wished
                            to stress regarding our overall aid program for CY'68: First, his hope
                            that we could provide sufficient import loans and PL480 rice; and
                            second, that we would be able to expand our food for work program, but
                            this would depend upon finding rupiahs for financing local costs of
                            program. He urged that we assist through providing additional
                            commodities for sale in Indonesia to help cover costs of transportation
                            and other expenditures related to program.</p>

                            wise course he had taken to attract foreign investment which, I felt

                            problems some American investors had encountered in their dealings with
                            Indonesian authorities and pointed out importance of straight-forward

                            the point without my having to belabor it). I also spoke of two major
                            meetings, in August and November, organized by Stanford Research
                            Institute and Time-Life, which already attracting large number of top

                            real interest in Indonesian investment. Suharto said he attached great
                            importance to these meetings, that he wanted to talk directly with those
                            attending August meeting. We touched on need for rehabilitation of

                            confirming his earlier request for US assistance in aerial survey but

                        <p>13. I was struck by how <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            views have matured since first we met privately on May 27 [26],
                                1966.<note n="9" xml:id="d236fn9">See <ref target="#d209">Document

                            exclusively related to grandiose military civic action <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0548"/>schemes for development of outer
                            islands and to wholesale transmigration of people from overcrowded Java
                            to these projects. In our discussions last fall, he had come to accept
                            the need for foreign investment as principal means for developing outer
                            islands, and, by that time, he had come to subscribe fully to
                            stabilization program as backbone of national economic policy. His
                            remarks at that time nevertheless reflected army-centrism and were
                            replete with expressions of concern re Communists but never re
                            Sukarnoists. In our long discussion last night, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> spoke as a national leader
                            rather than as an army leader. He did not present oversimplified view of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as immediate threat, but, more
                            realistically, directed his concerns towards lingering Sukarnoism,
                            disunity and defeatism. He did not reflect, as he has in past,
                            exaggerated expectations of US assistance. His stated views generally
                            parallel our own.</p>
                        <p>14. I am convinced that Suharto entertains no suspicions about our
                            alleged support for Nasution, an Islamic state, and other such nonsense.
                            These fears and suspicions, undoubtedly exaggerated by self-seeking
                            officers on <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s personal
                            staff, seem to have been dispelled by my recent talks with Generals
                            Sudjono, Sumitro and Hartono. I can see the possible beginnings of a
                            personal rapport with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            though I do not wish to exaggerate where this could lead, bearing in
                            mind that it may take some time for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> to break out of his Javanese mold which includes
                            doing things through intermediaries and by indirection. A responsive
                            reaction to his reasonable requests would, however, do much to assist in
                            our problem of communication with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>

                            his three-hour discussion with acting President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">See

                            substantive discussion with <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> in five months, his report merits more than the
                            usual attention.</p>
                        <p>Most of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s discussion is
                            focused on Indonesian internal problems and on his hopes for
                            considerable foreign assistance from the United States. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> explicitly stated his belief in
                            the goodwill of the United States towards Indonesia, but expressed doubt
                            as to whether we attached sufficiently high priority to Indonesia. He
                            sees a discrepancy between the views expressed by high ranking American
                            visitors and our response to his specific requests for foreign aid. He
                            expressed disappointment over the amount of program assistance planned
                            for 1968, and pointed out that most of the projected assistance is in
                            the form of PL 480 food supplies. Although he regards the United States
                            as “potentially our greatest friend”, he went on to state that “if I
                            cannot be sure of your assistance, then I will have to make another
                            plan”.</p>
                        <p>While I would not pretend to know what level of assistance we should be
                            providing to Indonesia, I am convinced that Indonesia should enjoy a
                            very high priority in our overall foreign assistance considerations.
                            These commitments should be made within a multilateral framework that
                            encourages substantial commitments from Japan and European nations. But
                            when one considers the size and potential wealth of the country and the
                            concentrated attempt of Suharto to restore stability and order in the
                            face of continued Sukarnoist opposition, it would be <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0550"/>shortsighted if we were to give an
                            inadequate response to the requests of the present government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> also indicated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed
                            considerable interest in the Vietnam problem,<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">See <ref target="#d236fn2">footnote 2, Document

                            there, and hinted that we should not exclude the possibility of causing
                            “floods” by bombing the dikes in North Vietnam. Suharto comments that
                            the Indonesians will continue to be helpful in communicating any
                            information they receive on North Vietnam, but he pointed out that
                            although they have contacts with North Vietnam, the North Vietnamese
                            “don't exactly trust us”.</p>

                        <p>Earlier in the week I was visited by two Indonesian army officers, both
                            of whom are in <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s inner
                            circle of advisers. They stated very frankly that their purpose was to
                            establish a personal channel of communications between General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and you. They said that although
                            American officials were invariably sympathetic to Indonesia's stated
                            need for assistance, follow up was disappointing. They said Suharto
                            hopes that you will breathe a greater sense of urgency and generosity
                            into the American response to Indonesia's aid requests.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear to what extent they were actually speaking for <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. There are reasons to suspect
                            they were simply trying to enhance their own influence by proving they
                            can bring home the bacon.</p>
                        <p>In any event, I think it is time that we take another look at the rather
                            restrained approach we have taken thus far to Indonesia aid requests. I
                            also think it is time to consider whether some initiative on our part
                            could not be used to start the foundation of a personal relationship
                            between you and General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.

                        <p>The Vice President's memorandum argues that Indonesia should have a very
                            high priority claim on our foreign assistance resources. Bill Gaud
                            agrees, but points out that, for a variety of reasons, we face serious
                            problems in meeting the commitments we have already made to Indonesia
                            for this year. Moreover, there is every reason to think we will have
                            even greater problems next year.</p>
                        <p>In other words, we are having trouble performing satisfactorily on what
                            we have already agreed to do, and we are beginning to doubt if we have
                            agreed to do enough.</p>
                        <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>To meet the immediate problem of our commitments during Calendar Year
                            1967, we must get at least 100,000 tons of rice for Indonesia. That will
                            leave almost $10 million of our current commitment unsatisfied. The
                            solution that would best meet Indonesian needs is to use some of our
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 Indonesian money as a cash
                            loan. That, however, is borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, for it leaves
                            us more than ever short of the resources required to meet our
                            commitments to Indonesia in CY 68. Basically, it looks as if we are
                            going to have to find more resources.</p>
                        <p>Indonesian expectations of American aid vastly exceed anything we are
                            going to be able to come up with. Whatever we do, they will be
                            disappointed. It is essential, however, that the gap between what we
                            give and what they expect not be so broad that their disappointment
                            turns into despair and disillusionment.</p>
                        <p>There is a way out of this. We will keep digging until we find it.</p>

                        <p>1. On August 4, 1966, the National Security Council considered a paper on
                            Indonesia which made cautiously hopeful forecasts for the coming
                                year.<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">See <ref target="#d215">Document
                                    215</ref>; for an account of the meeting, see <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>.</note> These forecasts have
                            proved realistic. Economic and political progress was perhaps slightly
                            better than expected a year ago, and the contributions made by the
                            United States and other major Free World countries to economic
                            stabilization followed the predicted pattern.</p>
                        <p>2. This paper reviews the current situation, projects a program of
                            action, and looks ahead to the prospects for the coming year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political </p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been eliminated
                            as a political force. The “New Order” led by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is well established in power,
                            and is neutralizing gradually “Old Order” hold-outs in the police,
                            marine corps, and parts of Central and East Java. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and his associates showed
                            sophistication and a fine sense of timing in managing the transition.
                            The thread of legitimacy was never broken. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0554"/>denied martyrdom. Instead, the
                            pernicious irrelevance of his leadership was gradually exposed, and the
                            hollow shell of rhetoric and revolutionary romanticism allowed to
                            crumble of its own weight. “Engineer” <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> now lives in internal exile in Bogor, a pathetic
                            old man transformed in eighteen months from the incarnation of the
                            Indonesian State into a historical relic.</p>
                        <p>4. This process of political transition was completed only in March of
                            this year, and a post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            political structure has not yet emerged. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> keeps his own counsel, and is inclined to
                            caution and gradualism. He is feeling his way among the conflicting
                            pressures of New Order activists advocating rapid, wholesale change, and
                            entrenched traditional political leaders defending the status quo.
                            Military-civilian distrust and suspicions add another element of stress.
                            There is some public criticism of the slow pace of change, but Suharto
                            has shown in the past a good sense of timing and an ability to recognize
                            and exploit a developing national consensus. The new election law is not
                            yet passed and, with a minimum of eighteen months lead time between
                            passage and elections, it is unlikely that the Indonesians will go to
                            the polls before late 1969 or 1970.</p>
                        <p>5. The past year has been one of solid accomplishment in the
                            international field. Indonesia settled its quarrel with Malaysia and
                            rejoined the United Nations and its associated organizations and
                            agencies. It has supported the concept of regional cooperation, and will
                            be meeting with its neighbors in the coming weeks to create a new
                            Southeast Asian regional organization. It has continued to adhere to a
                            non-aligned policy, and has maintained correct relations with the Soviet
                            Union and the States of Eastern Europe. Its relations with Peking,
                            however, are under severe strain, but both the Chinese and Indonesian
                            Governments appear desirous of avoiding a complete break.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic </p>
                        <p>6. Progress in domestic economic reform has been considerably greater
                            than was anticipated in August of last year. An ambitious and reasonably
                            effective stabilization program was put into effect. The pace of wild
                            inflation has been checked. Prices on major consumer items leveled off.
                            A stultifying jungle of licenses and controls was swept away and
                            replaced by a system that relies in large measure on free market forces
                            to determine import priorities. Government corporations were cut off the
                            dole and told to produce effectively or perish. Budgetary stringency was
                            introduced, and the military share of the budget cut in half. Political
                            risks were faced and highly subsidized prices for gasoline, electricity
                            and rail travel were raised to meet the costs of production. The Central
                            Bank, which under Sukarno was a fiscal mockery of that term, is now

                            investment law designed to attract foreign capital was passed.</p>
                        <p>7. These accomplishments are largely the results of the leadership of a
                            group of young economists from the University of Indonesia trained at
                            the University of California at Berkeley, <gloss target="#t_MIT1">MIT</gloss> and Harvard. These men have not only been responsible
                            for determining economic policy and overseeing its execution, they have
                            also participated in the international negotiations leading to debt
                            rescheduling and new aid. Most important of all, these economists have
                            won the unqualified support of General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> who has backed them without reservation in the

                        <p>8. These gains were achieved from a degree of economic collapse
                            unparalleled for a major nation in modern times, and much still remains
                            to be done. A substantial volume of trade still moves in irregular
                            channels. Government revenue is overly dependent on taxation of foreign
                            trade, and tax collection as a percentage of gross national product is
                            the smallest in Southeast Asia. Corruption and influence peddling
                            continue at all levels of government. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> regime, however, acknowledges the seriousness of
                            these problems, and spurred by strong pressures inside and outside the
                            government, is moving to deal with them.</p>

                            changes in attitudes and values. The baby boom of the 1950's has
                            produced a new post-revolutionary generation, a stranger to both the
                            heroics of the independence struggle and the spiritual indignities of
                            colonialism. This generation has taken the lead in a general rejection
                            of the slogans and ideology of the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> period, and pragmatism, rationalism, and
                            performance have become the new watchwords. A sober, objective judgment
                            of national self-interest is now more often the basis for decisions, and
                            Indonesian actions, if not always satisfactory, have at least become
                            more predictable.</p>

                        <p>10. Moving in response to the steps taken by Indonesia to put its house
                            in order, the United States and other friendly countries of the
                            non-Communist world cooperated in a joint effort to help Indonesia. They
                            agreed in Paris in December to reschedule somewhat over $300 million in
                            debts in arrears and falling due in the 18-month period ending December
                            31, 1967. They later agreed in Amsterdam to provide $200 million of new
                            assistance in CY 1967 to meet the foreign exchange gap estimated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> staff. The United States
                            committed itself to provide one-third of the total requirement if
                            Indonesia continued to make reasonable progress in its stabilization

                            Indonesia reached, through bilateral negotiations, a preliminary
                            understanding that would lead to rescheduling, under approximately the
                            same terms, the debt due the USSR and other Communist states. However,
                            the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe have thus far made
                            no contribution of new aid.</p>
                        <p>12. The International Monetary Fund has played a central role in advising
                            the Indonesian Government on its stabilization program. It maintains a
                            representative in Djakarta, and has taken part in all of the
                            international meetings on debts and new aid. The International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development made a preliminary survey of Indonesian
                            priority import requirements for CY 1967 and, at the Indonesian
                            Government's request, has a mission now in Indonesia studying the
                            question of transition from stabilization to the development phase. Both
                            the United Nations Development Program and the newly formed Asian
                            Development Bank have dispatched missions of experts to advise the

                            has made an invaluable contribution in the areas of stabilization

                            effort. These organizations provide Indonesia with sound professional
                            advice, act as a clearing house of economic information, <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0557"/>and serve both as impartial judges of
                            achievement and as politically insulated forces for encouraging minimum

                        </p>
                        <p>Indonesia's needs for foreign assistance are so great that only the
                            pooled resources of many nations can provide the necessary help.
                            Indonesia's continuing debt problem can be dealt with only on an
                            international basis. A multi-national approach is therefore both
                            desirable and necessary. All the major trading nations of the world have
                            a stake in the economic recovery of a nation with abundant natural
                            resources and a political economy of over 100 million people. We should
                            ensure that they bear their fair share of the burden, and avoid a
                            division of labor in which, in effect, we feed the cow and they milk

                            Indonesia to maintain a favorable environment for foreign

                            multi-national approach to Indonesia's economic problems, there has been
                            in the past a tendency, particularly on the military side, to look for
                            easy solutions in an outpouring of large quantities of American
                            assistance. The new Indonesian leaders have gained, during the past
                            year, a more realistic understanding of U.S. capabilities and aid
                            procedures. We must anticipate, nevertheless, some further random,

                            reduced. Indonesia needs rice, but must compete with the preemptive
                            requirements of Viet-Nam. Cotton, through <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, could be a major element in our aid, but
                            Indonesia's broken down textile industry has not been able to compete
                            with cheap Hong Kong imports. When idle capacity is restored, Indonesia
                            can absorb increasing amounts of our raw cotton.</p>

                            other countries. In addition, as Indonesia moves from the stabilization
                            to the development phase its needs will increase. Japan and Western
                            Europe may find it difficult to increase significantly their current

                        <p>Even assuming the best possible <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 mix, it is almost
                            certain that we will not be able to meet from anticipated resources
                            one-third of Indonesia's 1968 requirements. It may therefore be
                            necessary to go to Congress early next year for supplementary funds. We
                            have been in close touch with key members of Congress on the Indonesian
                            situation, and have found them favorably disposed both towards
                            assistance to the Suharto government and to our multi-national method of
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>19. Indonesia has been led to believe that if it faced up to its economic
                            problems, took the politically difficult steps to stabilize its economy,
                            and adopted sensible policies of self-help, it could expect support from
                            the world community. Indonesia's leaders have started down this
                            difficult road, and for them there is no turning back. The pace of
                            change must be maintained. We have seen at home and abroad how improving
                            conditions create expectations which become explosive if not fulfilled.
                            The Indonesians are performing on their side of the bargain, and the
                            United States and other countries of the Free World are confronted with
                            the challenge of dealing not with a failure, but with a prospective
                            success. We should not fail them.</p>

                        <p>(1) How to fulfill the U.S. share of the Inter-Governmental Group support
                            of the Indonesia stabilization program for Calendar Year 1967, on which
                            we are still $27 million short of the $65 million U.S. commitment;
                            and</p>
                        <p>(2) How to help stimulate rapid enough developmental progress in
                            Indonesia to sustain public and army support of the promising new trend
                            in Indonesian political orientation and leadership without loosening the
                            economic stabilization discipline which is essential to long run
                            solution of Indonesia's problems. The second of these two matters will
                            be the subject of studies being undertaken by the World Bank and Asian
                            Development Bank, which will not be available even in preliminary
                            outline until about the end of this year.</p>

                        <p>A.I.D. loans—$30 million</p>
                        <p>P.L. 480 cotton credit—$8 million </p>

                            480 cotton credit (if demand for raw cotton has by then revived) or by
                            an A.I.D. loan.</p>

                        <p>Agriculture concurs in the rice component of this package if it is
                            decided as a matter of policy that Indonesia is of sufficiently high
                            priority to risk diversion of rice from cash exports. Whether such
                            diversion will actually be necessary depends on the size of this Fall's
                            U.S. rice harvest, the trend in Vietnam rice requirements and the
                            behavior of the world rice market. With a bumper U.S. crop, we might get
                            by without any visible diversion at all. But if we didn't—and if the
                            diversion were fairly obvious—we could expect criticism on the Hill.
                            Secretary Freeman is prepared to take the risk if you concur with the
                            State/A.I.D. proposition that Indonesia is important enough to be worth
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, this package requires your approval to commit 100,000 tons
                            of P.L. 480 rice to Indonesia, as a priority claim on a supply which
                            otherwise could be fully absorbed in Vietnam, Africa, and in commercial
                            exports. This would not mean a rice shortage in Vietnam. It would still
                            permit providing Vietnam 550,000 tons under P.L. 480 from the current
                            U.S. crop. In addition, we would still be able in the Spring to provide
                            an additional 100,000 to 200,000 tons to Vietnam from the current crop
                            (to be divided between P.L. 480 and cash sales, depending on the
                            Vietnamese foreign exchange situation), plus small amounts to fulfill
                            outstanding commitments to the Congo, Ghana and Liberia.</p>
                        <p>However, the above allocation totals more than the minimum of 670,000
                            tons Agriculture now expects to be available for P.L. 480 from this
                            year's crop. Although our crop may turn out to be large enough to cover
                            it, we won't know until October. But it makes very good foreign policy
                            sense to let the Indonesians know now. The price of telling them now is
                            that if our crop is not any larger than the low end of Agriculture's
                            range, we will have to choose between lowering P.L. 480 rice shipments
                            to Vietnam and cutting into U.S. commercial rice exports.</p>
                        <p>Even with a very large U.S. crop, this rice commitment to Indonesia would
                            probably foreclose the possibility of meeting 100,000 tons of Vietnam
                            rice requirements from the United States, and cause Vietnam to turn to
                            Thailand or Taiwan for purchases with Vietnamese-owned foreign exchange
                            for that amount. We believe this will cause minimum domestic political
                            difficulty here if the commitment to Indonesia is made at the beginning
                            of the U.S. crop, i.e., this month, and any further Vietnamese purchases
                            are made from Thailand/Taiwan next spring when the U.S. exportable
                            surplus of rice is fully committed elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The extreme tightness of U.S. rice availabilities, despite a record crop,
                            and the growing shortage of rice in Southeast Asia to meet the world
                            demand indicate need for reconsideration of existing restraints on U.S.
                            rice acreage allocations for the future. This question will be addressed
                            by the Department of Agriculture, State, Budget Bureau and A.I.D. in the
                            near future looking toward budget decisions affecting the 1968–69 crop
                            year.</p>

                            commitment which will remain to be met beyond this 100,000 tons of rice.
                            This will have to be put together through some combination of non-grain
                            P.L. 480 and A.I.D. loans. But you need not make that decision now.</p>

                            the last year is heartening. Within the possibilities of our resources,
                            you want us to do our share in an Indonesian aid program which brings
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government forward to
                            stability and success.</p>
                        <p>II. You might then ask Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> to review briefly what has been accomplished
                            since our last <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting a year ago
                            (see Tab B for State paper on top of which is a summary we have
                                prepared).<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">At Tab B is Document 241 and
                                a White House summary of it. (Johnson Library, Meeting Note File,
                                #4, 1/67–11/67)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                            will ask Bill Bundy to amplify and define major action problems now
                            before us.</p>
                        <p>IV. You may then wish to go round the table and get comments from:</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> on the development picture
                            and prospects in Indonesia;</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> on the domestic rice
                            prospects and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 set aside. </p>
                        <p>V. You may then wish to put these questions:</p>
                        <p>—What are the 1968 prospects for assistance from all sources for
                            Indonesia?</p>
                        <p>—How do we plan now to meet our share of the common effort to generate
                            and maintain momentum in Indonesia? </p>
                        <p>Bill Bundy and Bill Gaud might be asked to speak to these questions.</p>
                        <p>VI. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: The World Bank and the Asian
                            Development Bank, as well as a number of private enterprises, will be
                            examining Indonesian development possibilities in the months ahead.) You
                            may wish to conclude by asking that a development program for 1968 and
                            beyond be prepared and submitted to you by, say, October 31,
                            including:</p>
                        <p>—major Indonesian efforts;</p>
                        <p>—contributions by other governments and international institutions;</p>
                        <p>—contributions by foreign private enterprise;</p>
                        <p>—the U.S. contribution.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by noting the great importance of
                            Indonesia and by recalling the meeting on this country one year ago in
                            the same room. He asked Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> for a review of developments over the past
                            year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> summarized the State
                            paper which had been prepared for the meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">
                                <ref target="#d241">Document 241</ref>.</note> He said that our
                            problems were those of progress. He forecast a need for perhaps $100
                            million as the U.S. share of Indonesia's requirements in 1968.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="italic">Bundy</hi> noted that Indonesia had just joined
                            with neighboring states in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
                            which met in Bangkok. Regarding the $100 million, he said that at
                            present $20 million might come from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                            $20 million in rice, $20 million in cotton. This left a shortfall of $40
                                million.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">Tom Johnson's notes report that
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> stated: “I would say that Indonesia
                                is one-third of the way up the slope. There has been much promising
                                economic activity. They have some resources of great value. For
                                instance, they have oil of low sulfur content which would be useful
                                in our cities.” Bundy also “did not see how we can handle one-third”
                                of $300 million.</note>
                        </p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> spoke on the need for
                            priorities in Jakarta. He said they should focus on: (1) Exports
                            (especially oil and rubber), (2) agriculture <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0565"/>(rice production, transport, price supports), (3) a
                            broader tax base, and (4) technical training (business administration,
                            etc.).</p>
                        <p>The President asked why only $20 million was programmed for 1968 aid to
                                Indonesia.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">According to Tom Johnson's
                                notes, the President asked: “Should we lend more money? Here is a
                                country which has rejected communism and is pulling itself up by its
                                bootstraps. Should we ask for an additional $100 million in this
                                year's request?” <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
                                answered. “No, I do not think so. I do not believe the Congress
                                would give us a net gain. They would probably take it out of some
                                other area such as Latin America.”</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> said it was the general
                            judgment that more was not possible from Congress, and that the
                            additional should be requested in a supplemental request after January
                            1.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> spoke admiringly of the
                            quality of the U.S. team in Jakarta.<note n="5" xml:id="d244fn5">According to Tom Johnson's notes, Helms also stated that the
                                excellence in Indonesia started at the Ambassadorial level and went
                                right on down, and added that “It's all low key. Our presence is not
                                prominent.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Marks said <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> was carrying out a
                            low-key operation and that it might expand a little, but not
                            dramatically.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> said that present
                            estimates indicated that an additional 50-80,000 tons of rice might
                            become available in this year's crop. He thought Indonesia could do a
                            great deal more in agricultural production and said it should be a rice
                            exporter.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would like to see Indonesia become a “showcase.” It
                            has great potential.<note n="6" xml:id="d244fn6">According to Tom
                                Johnson's notes, the President also said: “We should take some of
                                our ambitious plans which haven't been working in other countries
                                and put them into action in Indonesia.”</note> It is one of the few
                            places in the world that has moved in our direction. He asked if we were
                            doing all we could to boost oil production. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and others assured him that the American companies
                            (Caltex and Stanvac) were moving ahead and production was up.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said Japan could buy more oil, with minor changes in
                            its refineries. The Japanese were worried about over-dependence on
                            Middle East supplies. He recalled his long acquaintance with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>. He said military
                            rule continued and was likely to for some time. He said that additional
                            resources after January 1 might have to be drained off from other
                            sources rather than our looking to new funds.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said he disagreed with one
                            sentence in the State report, which was the suggestion that we might
                            have to do more than one-third in the year ahead if Japan and Western
                            Europe didn't come through. He urged that we stand fast on the one-third
                            share formulation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> spoke of the importance of
                            textiles and the need to rehabilitate the Indonesian textile industry.
                            This would provide a large market for our cotton.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> spoke of the
                            Indonesian military forces. He said the Army was U.S.-oriented; the Navy
                            and Air Force were Soviet-oriented. The military is capable of
                            maintaining internal security. He saw no need for “fancy” military
                            equipment. The main need was for civic action support and training
                                equipment.<note n="7" xml:id="d244fn7">According to an August 25
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to the

                                Memorandum No. 1382/67, August 25, which concluded that Indonesia
                                would refuse to send troops to South Vietnam because notwithstanding
                                its anti-Communism, its overall attitude toward the war in Vietnam

                            getting about $6 million in equipment and training. The country should
                            have high priority. He questioned whether any supplemental would be
                            possible after January 1, that the needed resources would have to come
                            from other programs. He said he thought the Philippines and Thailand
                            should have lower priority than Indonesia. The priorities should be

                        <p>Indonesia is a rich and strategic nation of 200 million people.</p>
                        <p>—No nation in recent history “has undergone a greater transformation than
                            Indonesia.”</p>
                        <p>—Indonesia's “New Order” government has thwarted Communist takeover;
                            ended confrontation; sought friendly relations with its neighbors;
                            rejoined the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; banned the Communist
                            Party; banished Sukarno. (“He is a forlorn figure, down to his last wife
                            and last kidney.”)</p>
                        <p>—Less dramatic, but still significant, are Indonesia's domestic
                            rehabilitation efforts; conversion to a free market economy; <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>-endorsed stabilization program; new
                            family planning and food production initiatives; new Civil Action
                            programs by the military; a 45% slash in military budget; strong efforts
                            to encourage foreign investment.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Indonesian Problems Remaining</p>
                        <p>Despite Indonesian progress and opportunities, problems remain. “They are
                            typical of what you would expect from 20 years of mismanagement by
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on top of the
                            Dutch tradition.”</p>
                        <p>—Weak political institutions.</p>
                        <p>—Endemic corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency.</p>
                        <p>—Dangers of creeping militarism.</p>
                        <p>—Anti-Chinese racialism. “I have travelled widely in the country and you
                            can see why 32% of inner island shipping is not operating… . The harbors
                            are blocked… . There is just 22 million dollars available to educate 40
                            million students… . But Indonesia does now have moderate and pragmatic
                            leaders.”</p>
                        <p rend="center">Comment by the President</p>
                        <p>Invited the Ambassador to describe the Indonesian budget. “I want the
                            Cabinet to hear about that.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador gave Indonesia's total budget as “500 million dollars for
                            110 million people.”</p>
                        <p rend="center">U.S. Policy for Future</p>
                        <p>The “New Order” government is determined to stabilize their nation. “We
                            can and must help them.”</p>
                        <p>“They have great resources. Oil, minerals, timber, fisheries… . But as
                            well as they are doing, Indonesia is now really flat on its back.”</p>
                        <p>The United States should continue its present “multilateral approach to
                            assistance.” We should continue or increase our partnership efforts with
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—emphasizing, especially, the
                            opportunities for private investment in the Indonesian future.</p>
                        <p>“This is Indonesia's critical hour of need… . We cannot neglect nor fail
                            them now… . The security of all Asia is affected… . Our sacrifices in
                            Vietnam avail little if we do not take strong and swift steps to foster
                            the growth and strength which the new Indonesia can achieve.”</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador concluded his report by reading the following excerpt from
                            a cable received this morning from AmEmbassy Djakarta:</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> believes just as well to
                            keep heat on Hanoi. If after U.S. elections negotiations should take
                            place prospects for satisfactory settlement would be enhanced. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> made clear that he believes our
                            position is correct at this time; he does not think we should stop

                            Indonesia's <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0571"/>economic situation,
                            its plans for 1968, and Vietnam were the principal topics.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for the help and interest shown by the U.S. in Indonesia's economic
                            problems and said he was happy to discuss them with a statesman of such
                            long and distinguished experience. He then outlined the range of
                            problems left by the neglect and mismanagement of the previous regime:
                            inflation, impassible roads, silt-filled rivers and harbors,
                            deteriorated airfields. Progress has been made during past year in
                            checking inflation. Road repairs, spurred by military action teams and
                            supported by village populations, were proceeding at a rate three times
                            that originally expected. Indonesia planned next year to operate on a
                            balanced budget, improve revenue collection, and expand exports. A sharp
                            decline in the price of rubber, however, is reducing export
                            earnings.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintaining the momentum of progress achieved in 1967, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> continued, is essential. The
                            people expect it. If progress is not achieved in 1968, there could be
                            the most serious consequences. Therefore, the government is planning an
                            increased budget of U.S. $ 1 billion (142 billion rupiah) for 1968 of
                            which 77 percent will be for the routine expenses of the government and
                            23 percent for rehabilitation. A total of U.S. $325 million in foreign
                            aid will be needed for next year, of which Indonesia hopes nearly half,
                            or $150 million will come from the United States ($125 in budget support
                            and $25 in project aid). Indonesia was hoping to obtain through <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 200 thousand tons of rice, 150
                            thousand bales of yarn. The remainder would be furnished in be [garble]
                            and development project loans. Suharto expressed the hope that the
                            United States would be able to make a firm commitment at the forthcoming
                            meeting in Amsterdam.</p>
                        <p>4. The Acting President then noted the effectiveness and importance of
                            the Indonesian military civic mission (civic action) program and urged
                            our continuing support.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> turned to international
                            problems and said that, while Indonesia was too occupied with internal
                            problems to play a major role, he wanted his country to contribute to
                            the best of its ability in the search for peace and stability in
                            Southeast Asia. He said Indonesia would continue to work for regional
                            cooperation and that national pride and national prosperity would be the
                            bulwark against outside aggression. U.S. could contribute to security by
                            maintaining outside the area the strategic force that could smash the
                            enemy bases, if aggression should occur.</p>
                        <p>6. On Vietnam he said that he had been unsuccessful in his efforts to
                            influence North Vietnam, but would continue trying. He suggested that
                            South Vietnam would be able to resist best when it was a “truly
                            national” nation, and that our strategy should be designed, in his view,
                                <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0572"/>to encouraging the
                            development of this nationalism, then, he said, we could safely reduce
                            our pressure.</p>
                        <p>7. The Vice President then responded to this extended presentation. He
                            said that the United States intended to participate in the multinational
                            effort to help Indonesia and noted that we had provided one-third for
                            calendar 1967. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> interjected
                            that the other countries might not be able to increase their
                            contribution, and that one-third from the U.S. would not be enough. The
                            Vice President continued that the others could do more than they are now
                            doing, especially Japan. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> that Congress had not yet passed the aid
                            legislation so it was impossible to be precise about what we could do,
                            but that a strong effort would be made, both at home and to enlist
                            support of other nations.</p>
                        <p>8. On the subject of food, Vice President asked <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> to discuss the details of
                            Indonesia's requirements with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>. He suggested that a careful survey be made of
                            distribution facilities so that spoilage of food waiting on the piers
                            would not occur. The Vice President said that we were facing a rice
                            shortage, despite expanding acreage, and suggested that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> carefully consider wheat, wheat flour,
                            and bulgur. We would be also willing to expand our food for work program
                            if worthwhile projects could be developed. On cotton, we should have
                            enough short staple to meet Indonesia's needs although the large surplus
                            of previous years has been greatly reduced.</p>
                        <p>9. The Vice President at this point noted the importance of dealing with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName> on all matters
                            related to assistance. Back door out-of-channel requests only confuse
                            the situation. He said that during Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>'s recent visit to Washington he had been invited
                            by the President to meet with the cabinet to discuss Indonesia. This was
                            most unusual and an indication of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s keen interest in Indonesia and his special
                            confidence in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>.</p>
                        <p>10. On the matter of private investment, the Vice President suggested
                            that Indonesia study what its neighbors were doing to attract private
                            capital so that it could successfully meet competition.</p>
                        <p>11. The Vice President then turned to Vietnam and described the great
                            changes he had found since his last visit 20 months ago. Great progress
                            had been made in the military field, but of equal importance were
                            efforts on the civil side, including revolutionary development. He
                            expressed confidence that the new elected government would do well. He
                            reaffirmed our determination to stay until the aggression stops and said
                            Indonesia might be able to help by passing this message to Hanoi. He
                            stressed that we would accept an immediate cease fire if productive
                            negotiations could begin promptly and if the other side did not use the
                            talks to gain a military advantage.</p>
                        <p>12. The Vice President said we would welcome any efforts that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could make towards peace. He was not
                            asking that Indonesia <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0573"/>involve
                            itself directly in Vietnam. Indonesia's efforts to stabilize and rebuild
                            its economy was a major contribution to the strength of Southeast Asia.
                            At the same time we appreciated understanding and moral support. We
                            heard critical voices from Southeast Asia—President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was not one of them, and with
                            our resources severely limited we were naturally more inclined to help
                            the friends who stood with us more than those who criticized.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> said that Indonesia
                            would continue to work for an Asian solution to the problem of Vietnam,
                            and concluded the talks with the observation that U.S. assistance to
                            Indonesian recovery was an investment in Southeast Asian security that
                            would bring far reaching beneficial results.</p>
                        <p>14. The Vice President closed with an expression of admiration for
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s vision, resolution,
                            and leadership and said he was confident that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and the government he led would succeed.</p>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> was relaxed, assured, and in impressive command
                            of detailed information on whole stabilization program. He responded
                            well to the points made by the Vice President, and the rapport was good
                            despite the use of an interpreter.<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">In

                        <p>On November 8, 1967, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> convened the 578th meeting of the National
                            Security Council, a special meeting to which he invited his Cabinet and
                            legislative leaders including Senators <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike
                                Mansfield</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RRB1">Richard
                                Russell</persName>, Margaret Chase Smith, William Fulbright, and
                            Carl Hayden and Representatives John McCormack, William Bates, <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0574"/>and George Mahon. The meeting
                            was to hear and discuss a report of Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>'s recent trip to South
                            Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Most of the discussion concerned
                            Vietnam, but according to <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Bromley</persName>'
                                <hi rend="italic">Smith</hi>'s summary notes, <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> gave the following report on
                            Malaysia and Indonesia:</p>
                        <p>“Turning to the other two countries visited, he said the acting head of
                            Indonesia, General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, and
                            the Malaysian Prime Minister both told him that if the United States
                            fails in Vietnam, all hope for a free Southeast Asia would be lost.</p>
                        <p>“In Malaysia the Prime Minister said that the enemy in Southeast Asia is
                            militant Asian Communism with headquarters in Peking.</p>
                        <p>“Throughout his trip, he encountered no act of hostility or protest in
                            either Malaysia or Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>“Indonesia: Its capital city, Djakarta, shows the many failures of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime, e.g.,
                            unfinished buildings. His welcome in the capital was warm, but even
                            warmer in central Java where more than a million and a half people
                            turned out to greet him on very short notice. The Indonesians really
                            want our friendship. They are enthusiastically trying to restore their
                            economy. As a specific example, 30,000 men are working on earth works
                            and clearing out irrigation ditches which will soon be providing water
                            for additional tillable acres.</p>
                        <p>“No promises were made as to what we would do to help Indonesia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is an honest,
                            hard-working man who benefited from his training at Fort Leavenworth.
                            Many other Indonesian military leaders are now showing the great benefit
                            of their military training in the United States. Our stakes are very
                            high in Indonesia; as high as those in Japan and India.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to comment on
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>'s report. Referring
                            to Indonesia, <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that
                            “help was being given to Indonesia by many nations through multilateral,
                            organizations such as the World Bank and the Indonesia Consortium. At
                            the end of the meeting, Representative Mahon asked if ”our stand in
                            Vietnam affected the situation in Indonesia?” Humphrey answered:</p>
                        <p>“Our stand in Vietnam has had a collateral effect on developments in
                            Indonesia. He had said in Djakarta that the change in Indonesia had been
                            brought about by Indonesians and that it came about as a result not of
                            our actions but theirs. However, it is thought that our presence in
                            Southeast Asia gave confidence to the Indonesians to destroy the
                            Communist Party in Indonesia.” (Summary Notes of the 578th <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, November 8; Johnson Library,

                        <p>Tom Johnson also prepared notes of this meeting, which concentrated on
                            Vietnam and did not differ appreciably from <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Bromley Smith</persName>'s with the following exception. Tom
                            Johnson noted that Representative <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0575"/>Mahon asked <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>, “if the one billion dollars in foreign aid
                            which had been poured into Indonesia was responsible for their success.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> answered that “he
                            did not believe it served the best interests of the Indonesians for us
                            to claim that our foreign aid caused it. It was a parallel part of the
                            total anti-Communist effort.” (Ibid., Tom Johnson Meeting Notes,
                            November 8, 1967)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SCL1">Schultze</persName>'s memorandum (Tab A)
                            will give you a good summary of the proposed conditions and negotiating
                            strategy. It boils down to this:</p>
                        <p>—If <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> is to stay afloat, he
                            must have about $325 million in aid next year. (This number will be
                            blessed by the World Bank and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>—We won't get $325 million unless we propose now to continue carrying our
                            1/3 share—$110 million. Even then, it will be tough.</p>
                        <p>—We can do most of our share, perhaps more than $100 million, in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice, cotton, cotton yarn, and wheat.
                            Even if Indonesia can't absorb as much of these commodities as we hope,
                            Bill Gaud promises he can make up any shortfall in 1968 and 1969 <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> money.</p>
                        <p>—Thus, when the consortium meets at Amsterdam on Tuesday,<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">November 21.</note> we would propose to start the
                            1968 ball rolling by stating our willingness to <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0576"/>contribute 1/3 of the overall aid
                            requirement the Bank and Fund certify. This will put maximum pressure on
                            the other donors—and stimulate the Indonesians to keep the pressure
                            on.</p>
                        <p>—If the other donors failed to raise their 2/3 the total, we would come
                            back to you for guidance.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had instructed him to express his regrets that
                            he could not come.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> responded that
                            he was sorry that President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had not seen fit to come. The opportunity to see
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and Prime
                            Minister Sato was a primary reason for going to Australia. As for the
                            letter from President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">Not further

                            as we can with respect to assisting Indonesia, but they must bear in
                            mind that our future aid level, as granted by Congress, is very low and
                            we expect the Indonesians, like India, will learn to use wheat. We are
                            short of rice. We shall increase the rice acreage by 20 or <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0577"/>30% but we could send wheat right now.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> believes the
                            Indonesians will like wheat when they get used to it. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> said President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> had switched rice cover food
                            ration from 100% rice to 40% rice and 60% bulgar wheat. The increase in
                            bulgar wheat consumption in Indonesia was outstripping U.S.
                            availabilities.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked Indonesia
                            to calculate its potential bulgar wheat requirements over the next 12
                            months and let us know.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then returned to
                            the problem with the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> appropriation
                            which had been cut one third. He would have to cut others for the U.S.
                            to fulfill its commitment to provide one third of the multilateral
                            assistance package for Indonesia. That is why he had wanted very much to
                            talk with President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and
                            Prime Minister Sato. In the meanwhile, Indonesia should be a good
                            international salesman for its cause in Japan and elsewhere. It can
                            count on the U.S. to provide one third of the aid but no more; the only
                            flexibility beyond that would lie in increased wheat consumption in
                            Indonesia; and at least 50% of our aid to be taken in form of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480.</p>
                        <p>The President reminded <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> again,
                            as the conversation ended, to let us know about the possibility of
                            absorbing more wheat.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In mid-March 1967, President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was removed once and for all from the Indonesian
                            political scene, thus ending an 18-month power struggle which had
                            preoccupied Indonesia's leadership and prevented concentration on the
                            nation's economic and political rehabilitation. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> administration should thus in
                            fairness be evaluated only on the basis of its performance during the
                            last three quarters of that year. Although not constituting an adequate
                            base for precisely charting the future course of the New Order regime
                            (which justifiably considers itself to be still in the first stages of
                            formulation), the events of the past nine months do provide some
                            valuable insights into the character of the new leadership and into the
                            nature of the post-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            Indonesia which it is to govern.</p>
                        <p>The year 1967 was clearly <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s
                            year in Indonesia. While his performance during this period pointed up
                            flaws in his leadership abilities (his slowness to act in some fields
                            and his unwillingness to act at all in others), it also showed his
                            ability to grow with the job and the fact that, despite grumbling about
                            his government, he is still in tune with majority sentiment within
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there is no one on the horizon who realistically aspires or has
                            the ability to replace <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>. No
                            other military man and probably no civilian at all could hold Indonesia
                            together as well as he has done. As Indonesia recovers further from the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> era and gains
                            greater confidence, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> may
                            one day become superfluous—as happened to his predecessor. But this has
                            not occurred yet and it is not likely during 1968. In fact, there is a
                            distinct possibility that <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            might be elected to a full five-year term as President in the Spring
                                <gloss target="#t_MPRS1">MPRS</gloss> session, with elections being
                            postponed until the early 1970's.</p>
                        <p>The year 1967 also highlighted the thinness of the layer of Indonesians
                            with managerial ability. By year's end, most of them were becoming tired
                            and a few discouraged at the magnitude of the problems confronting them.
                            The year 1967 also revealed that not all members of the “New Order” are
                            modernizers; some are clearly far more interested in their own profit
                            and power than in nation-building. As a result, corruption and the
                            prevalence of military influence in the top levels of the government
                            continue to cause political problems.</p>
                        <p>The performance of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government in laying a base for economic stabilization has generally
                            been adequate, despite such glaring shortcomings as permitting a serious
                            rice shortage to develop in <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0579"/>the
                            fall of the year (resulting partially from maladministration and
                            partially from inadequate rainfall) and a doubling of the rate of
                            inflation to which the economists in early 1967 hoped to hold the
                            nation. While the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was nonetheless
                            generally satisfied with the progress made in economic terms, the
                            average Indonesian had no more rice in the pot at the end of 1967 than
                            at the beginning, and what he did have cost him considerably more.</p>
                        <p>In the political field, progress was even less striking. The Cabinet
                            reshuffle in October was a halfway measure which, while it brought some
                            technocrats to power, also retained far too many of the old familiar
                            faces. Despite much talk and a good deal of maneuvering, no real
                            progress had been made by year's end to provide a pro-government but
                            essentially nonmilitary base for the government.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, while <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s
                            final eclipse relieved the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government of a heavy political burden, it also deprived it of the
                            valuable psychological asset which only a good enemy can provide.
                            Traditional animosities and fears quickly re-emerged as Indonesians
                            discovered that many of their most keenly felt problems were rooted not
                            in the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime but in
                            their own basic social and physical environment.</p>
                        <p>The New Order discovered during 1967, in short, that it must come to
                            grips with itself as well as with a host of external problems. This
                            difficult period of adjustment, which was still in full play at the end
                            of the year, highlighted weaknesses both in the New Order's leadership
                            and in its rank and file. These, among others, are the problems which
                            will crowd in on Indonesia's thin layer of effective managers during
                            1968.</p>
                        <p>Against this array of shortcomings, why the general optimism for
                            Indonesia's future? Partly because things could easily have been far
                            worse. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> successfully
                            avoided during the year a number of pitfalls, both political and
                            economic, which could have set the nation back much further than it now
                            is. He has stuck tenaciously to the economic program recommended by his
                            Western-trained economic advisers. Moreover, by year's end he was
                            showing greater confidence in his job, making an obvious effort to
                            “civilianize” his own image and travelling about the country to enlist
                            national support. All of these are encouraging signs that he will face
                            up to some, although certainly not all, of Indonesia's problems in
                            1968.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> must be
                            evaluated against the incredible mess he inherited. Things had to get
                            worse before they improved. The turnaround has not necessarily occurred
                            (Indonesians are seriously concerned over the possibility of a real
                            economic pinch in the first quarter of the new year); but with adequate
                            outside assistance we believe they can get through this difficult period
                            and show a record of unspectacular but definite progress in 1968. The
                            timing of outside <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0580"/>assistance
                            and the Indonesian capacity for sustained reform effort will, however,
                            be crucial.</p>
                        <p>On balance, we believe Indonesia's overall performance during 1967 was
                            adequate to justify continued optimism that the nation has set out on

                        </list>
                        <p>You have on several occasions stressed the importance of maximizing wheat
                            to Indonesia. As of November 1 we had agreed to sell them 10,000 tons of
                            bulgur. In the intervening three months we have raised this to 125,000
                            tons of bulgur and 27,000 tons of wheat and wheat flour.</p>
                        <p>We have, however, almost succeeded too well. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has now asked us for 350,000 to 450,000 tons of
                            bulgur during calendar year 1968.</p>
                        <p>We do not have the capacity to meet that request. At the present time the
                            bulgur processing capacity in the United States is 250,000 tons a year.
                            It is being increased, and we will be producing at a yearly rate of
                            400,000 tons by June. We have already earmarked almost all of the
                            increased production for Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>To get an additional capacity of 400,000 tons would require an investment
                            of about $5 million and a lead-time of six to nine months. It would be
                            an extremely perilous investment in view of the fact that the
                            acceptability of bulgur on the Indonesian market has yet to be
                            determined.</p>

                        <p>Our present bulgur shipments will be enough to handle the bulgur
                            component of the rice ration planned by <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> (one-fifth for military, one-fourth for
                            civilians). <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> wants to put
                            the additional 2–300,000 tons on commercial sale. There might—or might
                            not—be any buyers. (We do not yet know even the reaction to bulgur when
                            mixed with rice in the ration. The use of bulgur in the ration will not
                            begin until March.)</p>
                        <p>We no longer have a problem in pushing wheat. Everybody is a believer

                        <p>In March 1967 <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was
                            totally removed from power, and a “New Order” under the leadership of
                            Acting President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> assumed
                            full responsibility for governing the nation. The transition from
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, which took a year and a half of
                            patient and effective effort by the latter, did not produce the internal
                            upheaval many had felt was inevitable. The ease with which the
                            transition was accompanied was, in fact, a reflection of <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s excellent sense of timing and
                            his understanding of at least the dominant Javanese segment of
                            Indonesian society.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, removal of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> took away a convenient scapegoat with the result
                            that since March 1967 all of Indonesia's pent up expectations have
                            centered on the new government. With the departure of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, the “New Order” also lost
                            the unifying force of a common enemy, and social, cultural and religious
                            frictions have increased markedly during the past nine months.</p>
                        <p>These problems will continue to press in on the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government during the coming
                            year, as will the desperate shortage of trained personnel, Indonesia's
                            critical economic situation, the increasing expectations of the people,
                            revival of serious political in-fighting, and others.</p>
                        <p>Despite the problems and shortcomings which were accentuated during 1967,
                            we believe Indonesia has embarked on the long road toward modernization.
                            It is following sound economic policies and moderate foreign policies,
                            although progress in creating a domestic political base for the present
                            government is far slower than it could or should be. The present year
                            will be crucial to the success of these efforts, for during 1968 trends
                            will be set in motion which will determine the course of this important
                            nation for many years to come. (These problems are spelled out in detail
                            in a companion report—Djakarta A–358.)<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">For

                        <p rend="center">II. Our Dilemma</p>
                        <p>Following the removal of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, our bilateral relations with Indonesia improved
                            markedly. During 1967, American owned businesses, previously taken over
                            under the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> regime,
                            were returned to their original owners, and several American firms,
                            taking advantage of the present government's liberal economic policies,
                            concluded agreements for new investments in Indonesia. The bilateral air
                            agreement between Indonesia and the United States in late 1967 was one
                            of the most favorable we have concluded in recent years. The United
                            States has become the pace setter for aid to Indonesia within the
                            Inter-Governmental <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0583"/>Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss>), and an increasing number of
                            US officials visited Indonesia during 1967, highlighted, of course, by
                            the visit in November of Vice President Humphrey, who established a new
                            benchmark in our bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these and other factors, the US has become closely
                            identified with the goals and efforts of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government. Such an identification is in fact
                            inevitable since we have a heavy stake in the success of the “New Order”
                            not only for obvious reasons related to Indonesia's size, strategic
                            importance, resources and potential strength but also because it is the
                            latest test case of whether liberal economic policies combined with free
                            world assistance offer a more solid path to modernization than communism
                            or other totalitarian solutions.</p>
                        <p>In seeking to advance our national interests in and regarding Indonesia,
                            the United States Government faces two fundamental problems, one deeply
                            rooted in Indonesian cultural norms and the other in our own tendency as
                            a government to become too deeply involved in the affairs of other
                            nations. Our dilemma, simply put, is this: we cannot and must not let
                            the “New Order” fail, but we also must not become so active that we
                            conflict with Indonesia's cultural heritage or substitute our initiative
                            for theirs. We have faced the problem ever since October 1965 of
                            treading this narrow line, but the increasing importance of the US to
                            Indonesia's hopes for recovery means that the margin for error and for
                            misjudgment has become even more critical.</p>
                        <p>While our stake in the “New Order” is large, our ability to assist it is
                            circumscribed. The experience of the United States Government in
                            Indonesia over the past 15 years clearly shows that the injection of our
                            assistance into the Indonesian economy does not provide a directly
                            corresponding stimulus to growth but will often be rejected, deflected
                            or transformed by basic features in the Indonesian social structure.
                            Economic development through the infusion of foreign skills and assist-
                            ance apparently requires parallel development in other sectors of the
                            society. For this reason, it is perhaps best to regard our ultimate aim
                            in Indonesia not as economic development alone but as modernization.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, we would run grave risks if we attempted directly to
                            initiate or even counsel reform in the social structure, where are
                            moored the individual Indonesian's sense of security and identity.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> mobilized the
                            nation behind his policies by pointing to a Western threat to the
                            “Indonesian way of life” and the anti-communist campaign after the
                            October 1, 1965 events was powered with similar fuel.) Our problem,
                            therefore, is to choose from among the priority needs, programs which
                            are compatible with the Indonesian social structure and yet active
                            stimulants for change. The overall process must in the Indonesians' eyes
                            appear as “modernization,” not “Westernization” and least <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0584"/>of all “Americanization.” If the
                            process appears as “Americanization”, we will not only waste our funds
                            and incur blame for failures but, more importantly, will trigger long
                            acting rejection devices within the Indonesian society to what is
                            falsely identified as foreign intrusion rather than internal
                            development.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. Criteria for American Programs</p>
                        <p>To date we believe U.S. policy has avoided the worst dangers of this
                            dilemma and has successfully advanced U.S. interests. Our timely
                            economic assistance has strengthened the hands of Indonesia's
                            “modernizers” and the U.S. has also been successful to date in
                            supporting Indonesia's efforts to obtain substantial aid from other
                            donors. Our small but important <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> has
                            made a major contribution to encouraging the Indonesian military to move
                            into Civic Action projects which not only contribute to economic
                            stabilization but also help to enhance the local image of the Armed
                            Forces. Our informational and cultural programs have expanded modestly
                            during the past year, with particular emphasis being placed on
                            distribution of one-half million American books to Indonesian
                            educational and other institutions. We have also had continued success
                            in our efforts to quietly influence Indonesia's top leadership.
                            Indonesians not only seek our aid but privately they also seek our
                            advice and this has enhanced our ability to influence some, but by no
                            means all, developments. Finally, we have succeeded substantially in
                            convincing Indonesia to do business “through channels” and to cease
                            sending visitors to Washington armed with open-ended “hunting licenses”
                            seeking aid and special favors.</p>
                        <p>These past experiences and our estimate of the problems we will soon face
                            in the mounting urgency of the stabilization efforts and in the
                            implementation of the development plan lead us to suggest the following
                            broad criteria for American policy in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Regionalism </p>
                        <p>We must continue to encourage Indonesia to join in Southeast Asian
                            cooperation. In addition to the material and political benefits, closer
                            regional ties will encourage Indonesia to see itself as a partner and
                            participant in a world-wide process of modernization rather than a sick
                            patient in the hands of Western doctors. Indonesia's neighbors, however,
                            must be responsive. While suspicion on the part of some of Indonesia's
                            neighbors is historically understandable, we should encourage these
                            nations to realize that a “New Order” has taken over in Indonesia and
                            that, even if they fail to accept this fact, the best and most pragmatic
                            way to guard against the possibility of future Indonesian adventurism is
                            to embrace Indonesia's new government and interweave it inextricably in
                            responsible regional activities.</p>
                        <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0585"/>
                        <p>Our own expressions of support for regional organizations such as <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> should be decidedly low-key. The
                            Soviets, from whom the Indonesians hope to receive additional aid, are
                            already charging that <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> is a
                            “Western puppet” and the Indonesians fear that too close an embrace by
                            us would not only complicate their relations with Moscow but also add
                            substance to these allegations and perhaps make it more difficult for
                                <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> to enlist the support of
                            additional non-aligned nations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Multilateral Approach</p>
                        <p>We remain convinced of the necessity of setting our programs into a
                            multilateral framework, with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss> nations assuming together a position well in advance of
                            any individual foreign government. This is both a more forceful method
                            of persuading Indonesia to make the tough decisions that will be
                            required and a better guarantee against Indonesia sluffing off
                            responsibility to others' shoulders. The multilateral approach may,
                            however, prove too slow or inflexible to meet certain problems of
                            exceptional urgency and we must recognize the need for flexibility in
                            applying this criterion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Adaptations to the Indonesian Social Structure </p>
                        <p>There are three broad attributes of the Indonesian culture which will
                            constitute impediments to much-needed technical and project assistance
                            and which we should take into account in developing our programs: (1) a
                            predominantly traditional (as contrasted to rational) mode of thought
                            which resists change, stresses human adaptation to rather than
                            manipulation of environment and recommends avoidance rather than
                            resolution of conflict; (2) particularistic (or personalized) rather
                            than universalistic values, emphasizing loyalty to kin or, more
                            particular to Indonesia, to a protector (Bapak) rather than to
                            institutions or abstract codes of behavior; and (3) a decentralized and
                            compartmentalized organization of the society with relatively little
                            coordination exerted laterally and relatively little authority exerted
                            vertically.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the best single way of ensuring that an American program will be
                            adjusted to the Indonesian environment is to work through the so-called
                            “third culture,” that is Indonesians who have gained a broad knowledge
                            of our culture and yet retain accredited membership in their own. This
                            type of person, most prominently represented by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s team of economic advisors, can
                            serve as invaluable mediators between the two cultures. Every assistance
                            request should consequently by evaluated on the basis of whether the
                            Indonesians controlling or staffing the offices connected with the
                            program include a sufficient number of “third culture” persons.</p>
                        <p>A second prerequisite for evaluating the prospects for an assistance
                            program is to identify the “Bapak” or “Bapaks” into whose spheres <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0586"/>the project falls. If these are
                            corruptionists, solely political operators or pure traditionalists, the
                            project will probably be deflected from its economic as well as
                            political aims. In this respect, we should continue to promote the
                            modernizer-staffed Bappenas as the agency most directly responsible for
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>It is much more difficult to propose criteria to meet the problem of
                            compartmentalization and decentralization. For the immediate future,
                            however, we should probably concentrate our attention within particular
                            compartments and resist the temptation to place technicians in
                            coordinating roles between compartments where they are more likely to
                            replace than develop Indonesian initiative in central coordination and
                            supervision. (What we diagnose as lack of “managerial skill” is often
                            inability to move beyond the society's structure, a deficiency which
                            cannot be rectified with instruction in American management methods.) It
                            may prove more fruitful to work outward from individual compartments
                            than to attempt to build up prior or simultaneous coordination and
                            supervision between them.</p>
                        <p>The criteria in the immediately preceding paragraphs should not be
                            regarded as binding prerequisites but as safety precautions. They can
                            and undoubtedly must be set aside in certain instances. When it is
                            deemed necessary to provide technical assistance which will involve
                            coordination and supervision of separate Indonesian compartments, we
                            should first seek to have the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> or other multilateral bodies
                            take on this task. Where the U.S. must assume this role, the program
                            should be designed with exceptional care and flexibility. Advisors who
                            run a clear risk of being drawn into coordinative or supervisory roles
                            must be carefully selected on the basis of personality and understanding
                            of the local culture. They might in many instances also be placed on TDY
                            status so as to appear as temporary trouble shooters rather than
                            semi-permanent replacements for roles the Indonesians are unwilling or
                            unable to fill.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Restricting the American Presence</p>
                        <p>The criteria listed above all argue for continued restrictions on the
                            American presence in Indonesia. Although some growth in the size of the
                            mission must occur as we move into development projects, we would rule
                            out for the foreseeable future personnel from any U.S. Government agency
                            serving in sensitive fields such as community development, manpower
                            planning, much of public administration and some phases of local
                            agricultural development. Cultural programs should be concentrated in
                            binational centers in Djakarta and, if possible, Surabaya. (Savings in
                            personnel in this sector would pay high dividends if invested in
                            magazine subscriptions and more books for donation to key institutions
                            and individuals.) Finally, those personnel who are assigned to Indonesia
                            to work closely with Indonesians must be <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0587"/>carefully selected. (We have already had several minor
                            problems of adjustment.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Working from the American Social Structure</p>
                        <p>Moving Indonesians to an outside vantage point is undoubtedly the best
                            way to show them the deficiencies in their own social structure and
                            stimulate a desire for this change. For this reason, the participant
                            training program is perhaps the single most valuable component of a
                            modernization program and must be expanded.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure that this program results in the transfer of
                            modernizing attitudes as well as technical skills, we should consider:
                            (1) emphasizing training programs of at least two years in length for
                            adults; (2) concentrating on youth, whose attitudes are more flexible—we
                            should welcome the revival of the <gloss target="#t_AFS1">AFS</gloss>
                            program if the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officially asks for
                            it, although we cannot prompt the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> on
                            this issue; and (3) “team training” in which five or six Indonesians are
                            trained in related fields at the same time and at the same institution.
                            Upon return to Indonesia these teams should be so grouped in their
                            occupational fields as to provide mutual reinforcement against the
                            social forces which lead to a reversion to a traditionalist framework of
                            thinking. (<persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s economic team
                            of advisors is testimony to the success of this method.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">F. Building Indonesian Confidence</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the foremost requirement of any American assistance program is
                            that it serve to build Indonesian confidence in the modernization
                            process. This criterion is now most pertinent to the stabilization
                            program. Aside from causing important segments of the population to lose
                            faith in and withhold cooperation from the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government, failure of the stabilization program
                            would also perhaps cause <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            to lose confidence in pragmatic policies and those who have recommended
                            them (the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, Western governments and
                            his own team of economic advisors). It may, in fact, be useless to talk
                            of economic development if <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            is unable to surmount the inflation hurdle within the next eighteen
                            months.</p>
                        <p>We are now clearly faced with the probability that <gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss> nations at their March meeting will not
                            pledge the full $325 million of assistance requested of them by the
                            Indonesian Government and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Such
                            a result will risk losing the confidence which both the Indonesian
                            public and leadership have placed in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the multilateral approach, and this confidence is
                            perhaps a more important determinant to the success of the stabilization
                            effort than the sums left unsubscribed. If the United States moves to
                            make up this deficit, on the other hand, we risk setting an undesirable
                            precedent for a larger American role in and responsibility for the
                            stabilization program and perhaps the <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0588"/>development program which will follow. For the Embassy
                            the last risk is clearly the lesser. In the final analysis, of course,
                            the extent and nature of our aid must be measured against Indonesia's
                            own performance. Our long-term interests in this important country
                            require that we not substitute our initiative for theirs or be so
                            responsive to Indonesia's requests that pressures for self-help measures
                            are weakened.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV. Conclusion</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy towards Indonesia must address two broad problems, the
                            relatively short-term task of economic stabilization and the long-term
                            task of modernization. The approaches we have outlined above apply to
                            both problems but with different intensity.</p>
                        <p>Our role in economic stabilization is a relatively simple one because it
                            involves minimal contact with the Indonesian social structure:
                            multilateral agencies provide advice and supervision, an outstanding
                            group of “third culture” persons serve as capable intermediaries, and a
                            large American presence is not required. Our decisions in this sector
                            are nevertheless difficult ones as they are couched in urgency and must
                            weigh American resources against possible Indonesian loss of confidence
                            in pragmatic measures.</p>
                        <p>In defining our role in Indonesia's modernization, there is perhaps less
                            need for speed than caution. We are fortunate to be starting off with
                            virtually a clean slate as regards technical and project assistance and
                            information programs. Unlike Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, the urgency of
                            the Indonesian problem is not such as to preclude us from setting up
                            careful test procedures. With a cooperative government, a classically
                            traditionalist society and a good measure of material resources,
                            Indonesia constitutes a good test subject.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy consequently recommends that we treat our role in Indonesia
                            as a controlled experiment in modernization. We should begin to apply
                            the criteria we have set out above and develop new criteria as
                            experience is gained. The development of our assistance programs must
                            from the outset be geared to Indonesian performance. In this respect, we
                            will want to keep a careful watch not only on economic measurements but
                            also on the incidence of corruption, on the abuse of authority and on
                            the tendency towards militarism, all of which are relatively good gauges
                            of the progress towards modernization in the social structure.</p>

                            recommended $6 million in grant assistance to the Indonesian armed
                            forces in support of an on-going military program of civic
                            reconstruction. This program, which also includes training oriented
                            towards civic action in U.S. Service Schools, is now well under way and
                            has been operating effectively for about a year. Since the rationale for
                            the program is essentially political and economic. I feel it might be
                            useful to define more precisely at this stage the policy framework of
                            the program for the months ahead.</p>
                        <p>Our April 14, 1967 agreement with Indonesia<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">See 18 UST 384.</note> specified that our assistance was provided
                            “for a program of civic action … helpful to the economic and social
                            development of Indonesia.” The objective of the program is therefore a
                            limited one; to support and assist the Indonesian military in its civic
                            mission activities. In contrast to MAAG missions elsewhere, we are not
                            seeking to establish a service-to-service advisory role, nor do we wish
                            to participate in anything but the purely civic action aspects of
                            Indonesian military planning.</p>
                        <p>“Civic mission,” as used by the Indonesian military, embraces a much
                            broader range of activities than we would regard as “civic action.” The
                            Indonesians, for example, consider the construction of barracks and
                            commercial or industrial activities undertaken by military personnel
                            also as part of the “civic mission.” While it is difficult to draw firm
                            guidelines in this area, we feel that our resources, to the maximum
                            extent possible, should be used for projects in the public works field
                            of direct and immediate benefit to the civilian population.</p>
                        <p>Counterinsurgency is often linked with civic action in an over-all
                            internal defense program. In Indonesia we wish to maintain a clear
                            distinction between these related military activities and leave
                            counterinsurgency entirely in Indonesian hands. Localized civil
                            disturbances have been endemic in Indonesia since independence, and two
                            such <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0590"/>uprisings are now in
                            progress in West Borneo and West New Guinea. Indonesia, in the past, has
                            not sought our assistance in meeting these situations. It is possible,
                            however, that the current financial straits of the Indonesian Government
                            might persuade the military authorities to look to our Military
                            Assistance Program as a source of supplementary budgetary support for
                            counterinsurgency.</p>
                        <p>Under present circumstances, we would wish to avoid such involvement.
                            Neither of the current uprisings, restricted to isolated areas of the
                            archipelago and involving ethnic minority groups, is any threat to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government. The
                            Indonesian Army is well supplied with small arms, and has had 23 years
                            of experience in counterinsurgency operations. There is no pressing need
                            for United States involvement, and to begin assistance, even on a small
                            scale, would establish a continuing lien on limited <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> resources. Further, the use of American
                            equipment against the Papuan dissidents would be politically awkward
                            because of the role of the United States in the 1962 settlement turning
                            over West New Guinea to Indonesia. We do not, of course, wish to rule
                            out the possibility of counterinsurgency assistance to Indonesia under
                            different circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Professor Widjojo, after extending the greetings of President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, stated that there had been
                            setbacks in the Indonesian economy since the Vice President's visit in
                                November.<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">See <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> Early this year there <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0592"/>was an economic crisis. Confidence in
                            the economic policies of the government has been shaken, both inside and
                            outside the government. At the Rotterdam meeting a week ago, the results
                            were very disappointing.</p>
                        <p>Professor Widjojo stated that he believes Indonesia cannot survive a
                            second crisis. The basic need is food. Therefore, they have asked the
                            U.S. Government for additional food assistance. They need rice, wheat,
                            flour, and bulgar wheat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bullitt stated that the United States Government officials dealing
                            with Indonesian affairs held off responsibility to the Indonesian
                            request because we want to see what the Japanese do before we respond.
                            The Vice President inquired whether we or they had put pressure on Mr.
                            Miki. We should talk to him, as the Vice President had spoken to both
                            Miki and Prime Minister Sato at great length about the Indonesian
                            situation. Indonesia is very important to Japan, both as a market and as
                            an ally in Asia. We must be very firm with the Japanese on this.
                            Professor Widjojo replied that the Indonesians had already used their
                            biggest gun—by having President <hi rend="italic">Suharto</hi> visit
                            Japan. The results were negative.</p>
                        <p>Professor <hi rend="italic">Widjojo</hi> stated that he not only wanted
                            to try to solve the food problem but to try to stop the ruinous
                            inflation of the last several years. A major related problem is that of
                            food production. They need fertilizer assistance as well as food.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President stated that with the oil industry in Indonesia you
                            would think that the resulting petrochemical industry would produce
                            fertilizer. Professor Widjojo stated that there are studies underway for
                            the expansion of the petrochemical industry. Mr. Bullitt stated that one
                            problem is that the government oil monopoly had refused to make
                            commitments to guarantee a regular supply of oil. For this reason,
                            foreign investors and the oil companies generally were reluctant to go
                            ahead with expansion of the petrochemical industry.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President suggested that the time is late for continuing
                            studying the situation. Progress must be made in getting the fertilizer.
                            The time has arrived for a frank talk with our Indonesian friends. The
                            Government of Indonesia must be willing to take decisions to get the
                            petrochemical industry to develop. If the government is not willing to
                            do this, they cannot expect help.</p>
                        <p>Professor Widjojo stated they also have natural gas as a source of energy
                            supply. They hope to expand their food for work program this year with
                            the help of the U.S. Governmental food assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired of Professor <hi rend="italic">Widjojo</hi>
                            whether he had seen Mr. Linen of Time-Life, the man who organized the
                            Geneva meeting last November. He had sent a copy of the report on the
                            conference to the President, to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, and to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>. It is time, he said, <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0593"/>that the Indonesian Government takes some strong
                            measures. Also, we must be able to demonstrate here that the aid is not
                            being misused. This is of continual concern here, both in the government
                            and outside. The Vice President stated that if he had his way, we would
                            be doing much more, but that the Indonesians must understand that their
                            friends and supporters here do have a difficult time in dealing with the
                            Congress. We know that there is a degree of public and private
                            corruption. This is a continuing public relations problem. It would be a
                            national/international disaster if the Suharto government would
                            fail.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Soejatmoko stated that they have an immediate need for
                            fertilizer as well as for food. The Vice President stated that Indonesia
                            must be able to demonstrate what Mr. Jim Linen talked about in his
                            report: a spirit of confidence in the Indonesian economy. The Vice
                            President knows that the United States business cannot do everything
                            that needs to be done; the economy cannot be turned over to them. They
                            can be permitted to chew up the economy and exploit it. But they must be
                            convinced that the over-all environment in Indonesia is favorable for
                            the economic development of the country. The Vice President apologized
                            for speaking so frankly, but since “we are allies with- out any kind of
                            a treaty,” we must be frank in assessing our mutual problems.</p>
                        <p>He knows that Professor Widjojo and the economic team understands these
                            problems, but the military does not. The military must be made to
                            understand what the situation here is in the Congress and with the
                            public. The Vice President told Professor Widjojo that he and his
                            colleagues are good men or they would not be here. He knows that the
                            security of their country is essential to Asia. We and our allies cannot
                            help Indonesia to the point that what we do in Vietnam will be of no
                                avail.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">Widjojo and Salim also meet with

                                Directorate of Intelligence prepared an Intelligence memorandum,
                                    ER–<gloss target="#t_IM1">IM</gloss> 68–81, July 1968, which
                                assessed Indonesia's prospects for economic stability. The
                                memorandum suggested that because of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s “more than a decade of mismanagement” a
                                quick economic recovery was not assured. Foreign aid to Indonesia
                                basically went to stabilize inflation and there was little earmarked
                                for long-term rehabilitation. Indonesia suffered from faster
                                population growth than growth of food production, declining exports,
                                and a poor transportation system. Although economic progress under
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would be slow,
                                most of Indonesia's 112 million people lived in a “non-monetary,
                                subsistence environment and do not expect radical improvements in
                                their living standards.” Economic deterioration was more likely to
                                cause political unrest in Indonesia's cities. (Johnson Library,
                                National Security File, Country File, Indonesia, Vol. VIII,
                                6/67–6/68)</note> The cabinet is composed of 18 portfolio ministers
                            and five state ministers who will have general supervisory functions.
                            The government's commitment to modernization is evidenced by the
                            inclusion of two of Indonesia's leading economists; its determination to
                            avoid a junta-type government is demonstrated by the increase in the
                            number of civilians (from fourteen to seventeen) as compared to military
                            officers (from nine to six). The two economists are particularly
                            distinguished; Dr. Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, who helped lead the
                            rebellion against Sukarno in 1958 and lived in exile until last year, is
                            Minister of Trade, while Ali Wardhana, a key adviser to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, has been made Minister of
                            Finance.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Indonesia's leading political parties have been given
                            prominent representation at the level of state minister in the new
                            cabinet; relatively pro-regime leaders of the three largest Muslim
                            parties and of the secular Nationalist Party hold these positions. In
                            addition, among the technocrats holding portfolios are leaders of other
                            political parties or, in some cases, spokesmen for particular points of
                            view; Dr. Sumitro was a founder of the banned Indonesian Socialist
                            Party, former Murba Party official <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam
                                Malik</persName> remains as Foreign Minister, and <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0595"/>Professor Seno Adjie of the

                            previous cabinet.</p>
                        <p>A further earnest of the government's interest in economic development
                            and its willingness to seek popular support is the curtailment of some
                            of the powers of President <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s much-criticized private staff, SPRI (Staf Pribadi
                            Republik Indonesia), composed of generals of varying ability and
                            honesty, led by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] Major General Alamsjah. SPRI has now been
                            deprived of its coordinating function over the cabinet and there are
                            reports that Alamsjah will soon go abroad as an ambassador. The number
                            of military officers in the cabinet has been reduced, dropping from nine
                            to six, while the number of university professors has risen from four to
                            seven. Old Order or Sukarnoist military officers, however, were placed
                            in charge of the ministries of manpower and information.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s appointments to the new
                            cabinet should help to quiet criticism from the students, who have again
                            been demonstrating against the country's slow economic progress, and
                            from the political parties, who object to the “green wall” of military
                            uniforms between the presidency and the public. However, unless this new
                            momentum can be sustained by performance, dissatisfaction can be
                            expected to grow strong again.</p>

                        <p>The International Monetary Fund set $325 million as Indonesia's need for
                            foreign assistance in calendar year 1968. We have adhered to a formula
                            by which the United States and Japan each meets one-third of the need,
                            and the rest of the world picks up the remaining third. The Japanese
                            have been very slow this year, but it now looks as if they will meet
                            their $110 million share. The other donors have also lagged, <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0596"/>and will probably not give Indonesia
                            much more than $80 million this year.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia's needs are greater than ever. Despite the government's
                            responsible policies, the stabilization program has thus far failed to
                            work. There was an almost 60% inflation in the first quarter of this
                            year, mainly as a result of inadequate food supplies. If another year
                            passes without the government's economic policies taking hold, both
                            those policies and the government itself will be in danger. In
                            recognition of this fact, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and
                            the Asian Development Bank have both called for emergency food
                            assistance to Indonesia, above and beyond the $325 million figure.</p>
                        <p>The problem, then, is how to help meet Indonesia's needs, including
                            emergency food assistance, without breaking the one-third formula (which
                            is popular with the Congress, and very useful in pressuring other donors
                            to meet their obligations).</p>
                        <p>Attached is an Indonesian aid package proposed by Bill Gaud and <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Orville Freeman</persName> and blessed by Charley
                                Zwick.<note n="2" xml:id="d258fn2">The “package” was in a memorandum
                                from <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PRM2">Poats</persName> (Acting for <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>) to the President, June 7.
                                Support for the proposal from <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ2">Zwick</persName> was in a memorandum to the President from him,
                                June 12. (Both ibid.)</note> It meets the problem—by treating our
                            wheat assistance to Indonesia as experimental and a response to the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>/ABD call for emergency food
                            needs. Therefore the wheat is not to be counted this year as part of our
                            one-third contribution to the international consortium's goal of $325
                            million.</p>
                        <p>Although this approach is slightly artful, it is also justifiable. No one
                            knows how rapidly the market in Indonesia for wheat products can be
                            expanded. We are offering 350,000 tons ($46 million) of wheat flour and
                            bulgur to be shipped as rapidly as it can be utilized. But it is
                            impossible to say how much can be used by the Indonesians during 1968.
                            It is, therefore, reasonable to treat it separately from our 1968 aid
                            pledge, and outside the one-third formula.</p>
                        <p>By treating wheat separately, we are able to offer $156 million of aid
                            now. This is psychologically very important in shoring up the confidence
                            of the Indonesian Government and in convincing the Indonesian business
                            community that the resources will be available to avoid another
                            inflationary spiral at the end of the year. Apart from the wheat, the
                            package is made up of:</p>
                        <p>—200,000 tons of rice, worth $41 million;</p>
                        <p>—160,000 bales of raw cotton and the equivalent of 70,000 bales of cotton
                            yarn, worth $44 million;</p>
                        <p>—a $25 million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Development Loan;</p>
                        <p>—this totals $110 million, our one-third share of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> goal.</p>

                        <p>In addition, <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> want to be able to tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> now that we will
                            consider another 100,000 tons of rice and another 80,000 bales of cotton
                            in the fall as a down payment on our 1969 aid to Indonesia. This will be
                            extremely valuable to <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>,
                            both in assuring that the pipeline stays full and in allaying fears of
                            another rice shortage during the critical January–March period.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> does not object
                            to the package. He does, however, believe that we should keep the
                            pressure on the other donors, count wheat next year after the program
                            has proved itself, and clearly identify any pledges made this fall as
                            part of our 1969 aid. I agree with him on all three counts. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> also would like to set aside
                            part of the proceeds from the sale of wheat for a fund to promote U.S.

                            place in The Hague on October 20–21. The purpose of the meeting is to
                            agree upon Indonesia's aid requirements for calendar year 1969. We also
                            make our pledge at this meeting as an incentive to other donors.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia will request and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and
                            World Bank will support a total aid package of $500 million ($380
                            million in economic aid and $120 million in food).</p>
                        <p>Attached is a memorandum from Bill Gaud and <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Orville Freeman</persName> which proposes that we pledge about
                            one-third ($130 million) of the economic aid and offer to meet “the
                            bulk” (up to $100 million in PL 480 rice and wheat) of Indonesian food
                            aid needs.<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> to the President, October

                            satisfactory commitments from other donors and satisfactory performance
                            by the Indonesian Government on its stabilization program.</p>
                        <p>In the past we have talked of meeting Indonesia's total aid needs through
                            a one-third formula (one-third from us, one-third from the Japanese,
                            one-third from everybody else). In fact, however, we departed from this
                            formula last year when our wheat aid of $50 million and the short-fall
                            in the European aid commitment resulted in our providing 46% of
                            Indonesia's actual aid receipts.</p>
                        <p>The proposal being submitted to you this year would also mean that we
                            pledge 46% of Indonesia's stated aid needs for 1969.</p>
                        <p>The proposal is based on two assumptions:</p>
                        <p>1. that it is an important aim of American policy to provide Indonesia
                            with the external aid she requires,</p>
                        <p>2. that we should give our aid in such a way as to maximize European and
                            Japanese contributions. Frankly, unless we do more than one-third there
                            is little prospect that Indonesia's need for $500 million of foreign aid
                            in CY 1969 will be met.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese, from Prime Minister Sato down, are now talking about doing
                            less than their 1968 level of $110 million. In 1968 the Europeans fell
                            far short of their $110 million. In fact, a rigid adherence to the
                            one-third formula would probably lead the <gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss> countries to refuse to agree to the $500 million figure
                            as Indonesia's requirement.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we propose to apply the one-third formula only to the non-food
                            part of Indonesian needs, about $380 million. That gives the Japanese
                            and the Europeans a target of $130 million each. They will groan, but we
                            believe they can be induced to accept the figure.</p>
                        <p>On food aid, Agriculture assures me that market conditions are such that
                            we will wish to provide Indonesia with at least 300,000 tons of rice and
                            as much wheat as she can use. Therefore, the proposal is that we pledge
                            ourselves to pick up the bulk of Indonesia's food aid needs, while still
                            pressing other donors for as large a share as we can get from them. We
                            would tell the Indonesians that we are thinking of about $60 million of
                            rice and perhaps $40 million of wheat.</p>

                            approach is that the Indonesians need to be able to plan their food
                            procurement rationally, and cannot do so without some idea of what we
                            intend to do for them. Moreover, the distinction between <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s “fair share” and <persName corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName>'s “bulk of food needs” is really a matter of
                            semantics. If we do not meet the “bulk” of Indonesia's food aid needs,
                            they will not be met. It is not in our interest to have another food

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. The government headed by General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> and supported by the army is in effective
                            control of Indonesia. Over the short term, the most likely sources of
                            opposition are the political activists of the <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0603"/>younger generation and the old-line
                            political parties. Though the Indonesian Communist Party is still badly
                            disrupted, it is possible that over the longer term a radical
                            nationalist movement could develop mass support in Indonesia once again.
                            Nevertheless, the army will almost certainly retain power for the next
                            three to five years, presumably under the leadership of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>B. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government has
                            adopted a moderate, pragmatic approach to Indonesia's serious economic
                            problems. The pace of economic progress will almost certainly be slow
                            for the next few years, and even that pace is contingent on deferment of
                            large foreign indebtedness and substantial new foreign aid and
                            investment. The effectiveness of the government will continue to be
                            hampered by administrative inefficiency, inadequate transport and
                            communication facilities, and basic constraints endemic in Indonesian
                            society, notably a paternalistic system of cultural values that inhibits
                            social discipline.</p>
                        <p>C. Though Indonesia will remain officially nonaligned, there is likely to
                            be a continuation of the present trends toward improved relations with
                            neighboring countries and the free world, cool relations with the USSR,
                            and hostility toward Communist China. Basically, the present government
                            would like to have the US involved somehow in the protection of
                            Southeast Asia against China, yet it would not favor a direct security
                            relationship with the US or any other outside power, lest this cast
                            doubt on Indonesia's nonaligned image or hinder any future effort by
                            Indonesia to assert its primacy among the Malay peoples. In the unlikely
                            event that the present moderate government were replaced by an
                            authoritarian regime bent on diverting attention from domestic problems,
                            Indonesia might revert to an aggressive policy vis-à-vis Malaysia and
                            Singapore.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Introduction</p>
                        <p>1. The course of modern Indonesian history has shifted decisively in the
                            three years since the Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) failed in its attempt to eliminate the
                            power of its principal rival, the Indonesian Army. Since the momentous
                            events of October 1965, the army has gradually consolidated its position
                            as the political arbiter in the nation. With caution and deliberation,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, the leader of the
                            army, has destroyed the power of the Communists and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and has himself assumed
                            the office of President.</p>
                        <p>2. The “New Order,” as the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government styles itself, represents a fundamental change in the
                            direction of Indonesian political life. In place of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s politics of emotion and
                            policies of adventure, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has
                            adopted a pragmatic approach to Indonesia's problems. In foreign
                            affairs, this means a policy of nonalignment that leans toward <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0604"/>the West and nourishes hope
                            that Djakarta may someday assume a more vigorous regional role. It also
                            means that over the next few years the government will be preoccupied
                            with domestic matters—above all, Indonesia's tremendous economic
                            problems.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Political Situation</p>
                        <p>3. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government provides
                            Indonesia with a relatively moderate leadership. Although the army
                            constitutes the power base for the government, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> practices the traditional
                            Indonesian style of consensus politics. Thus, he has taken care to
                            associate responsible civilian politicians and intellectuals with his
                            government. Indeed, in the reshuffle of the Cabinet in June 1968, a
                            number of Western-trained civilian economists were given key roles in
                            the formulation of a five-year plan for economic development. These
                            appointments, added to the presence in the Cabinet of such moderates as
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Adam Malik</persName>, have
                            improved the public image of the government and made it more acceptable
                            to those opposed to military rule. The government's commitment to hold
                            nationwide elections<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">The nature of these
                                elections is far from clear. Presumably they will choose at least
                                part of the members of the Consultative Congress and the Parliament;
                                the present members of both bodies hold office by virtue of
                                appointment. The elections are not likely to affect the status of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, who was elected
                                by the Consultative Congress in March 1968 to a five year term as

                            contributed toward those ends.</p>
                        <p>4. The strengths and weaknesses of the government reflect those of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> himself. During
                            the process of dismantling the “Old Order” of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> provided much needed stability and authority.
                            Nevertheless, the slowness of his pace, then and now, has provoked
                            considerable impatience and criticism, even among his principal
                            supporters. The reticence of his own temperament is reinforced by his
                            contempt for the excesses of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, leading him to disdain any appeal to emotion.
                            His apparent inability to elicit popular enthusiasm may make it hard for
                            his government to deal rapidly enough with the major problems facing the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>5. In this event, differences and discontent among the military
                            leadership are likely to increase and could eventually impede the
                            effective coordination and implementation of national programs. Nor can
                            we rule out the possibility of political conspiracies among the military
                            or efforts by regional commanders to assert greater independence of
                            Djakarta. There is no evidence of any serious splits within the military
                            leadership or of interest in a coup, but the top leaders will keep a
                            wary eye on a number of the more militant younger officers.</p>

                        <p>6. Overt <hi rend="italic">political opposition</hi> to the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government has not been
                            substantial. Most politically articulate elements have been willing to
                            wait and see what the regime can accomplish. A potentially disruptive
                            force is the younger generation of political activists whose appetite
                            for politics was whetted during the campaign against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The government has been
                            fairly responsive to their demands, even granting the student “Action
                            Commands” a measure of participation within the nation's highest formal
                            policymaking body, the Consultative Congress.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">According to the Indonesian Constitution of 1945,
                                the Consultative Congress has the power to determine the broad lines
                                of national policy, to elect the President, and to amend the
                                Constitution. The Parliament, while subordinate to both the
                                President and the Consultative Congress, has responsibility for
                                enacting legislation. Its members are automatically members of the
                                Consultative Congress. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Thus,
                            they are now relatively quiescent, lacking at least temporarily the
                            leadership, organization, and a compelling issue that could bring them
                            back into the streets. Nevertheless, they are potential collaborators of
                            the more militant army officers, who share their impatience at the slow
                            pace of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government.</p>
                        <p>7. The legal political parties have also been partially neutralized by
                            their dependence on the government for patronage. Potentially, the most
                            hostile party elements are the left-wing of the Indonesian Nationalist
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>), which has been at least
                            temporarily repressed, and the traditionalist Muslims within the Muslim
                            Scholars' Party (<gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss>) who are unhappy
                            about the secular trend of the present regime and believe that
                            Christians have a disproportionately large role in the government. These
                            parties have little choice but to go along with the government for the
                            time being. They are too weak and divided to marshal much pressure to
                            restore the free-wheeling parliamentary system that proved so
                            debilitating during the 1950's.</p>
                        <p>8. The government, for its part, has paid lip service to the idea of
                            restructuring the party system, with the dual purpose of providing a
                            political base for itself and of opening constructive channels for such
                            currently disorganized civilian elements as the modernist Muslims and
                            the democratic socialist left. Thus far, little progress has been
                            achieved toward that end. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s military advisers have apparently persuaded
                            him to block the installation of a new chairman by the Indonesian Muslim
                            Party (PMI), thus causing considerable resentment in moderate and
                            modernist Muslim circles.</p>
                        <p>9. The Indonesian Communists do not currently constitute a serious threat
                            to the government. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was badly
                            shattered after the attempted coup of October 1965, and they have
                            suffered further serious setbacks since then. During the summer of 1968,
                            the army wiped out an incipient Communist insurgency in East Java and
                            killed or captured <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0606"/>a major part
                            of the Maoist-oriented <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leadership.
                            Although the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government is
                            weeding out leftists from the armed forces, and has largely neutralized
                            those within the air force and the police, the recent exposure of
                            Communists and Sukarnoists within the army itself has demonstrated that
                            the services have not yet been completely purged.</p>
                        <p>10. A longer term danger lies in the social and economic conditions that
                            enabled the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to build a potent force
                            before 1965. These conditions, and the difficulty of changing them, will
                            provide numerous issues to exploit; thus, it would be premature to
                            regard the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as an unimportant factor.
                            Moreover, its potential would increase considerably if new leaders
                            emerge and are able to revive the alliance with leftists in the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and with other former Sukarnoists. If,
                            over the longer term, the present government's efforts at economic
                            development should seriously falter, a radical nationalist movement
                            could develop mass support in Indonesia once again.</p>
                        <p>11. There is no force in Indonesia today that can effectively challenge
                            the army's position, notwithstanding the fact that the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government uses a fairly light
                            hand in wielding the instruments of power. Over the next three to five
                            years, it is unlikely that any threat to the internal security of
                            Indonesia will develop that the military cannot contain; the
                            army—presumably led by <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>—will almost certainly retain control of the
                            government during this period. The leadership will try to keep politics
                            in abeyance and concentrate the government's energies on the country's
                            tremendous economic problems. The next few years will be critical,
                            therefore, in determining whether the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government can govern effectively.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B. Administrative and Social Problems</p>
                        <p>12. Even given a period of political stability, the effectiveness of the
                            government will be hampered by the shortcomings of Indonesia's vast
                            bureaucracy. No one knows exactly how many civil servants there are; the
                            figure certainly exceeds one million, with another one to two million
                            employed by state enterprises. The extremely low pay scales and the
                            extensive links between the bureaucracy, the political parties, and
                            other narrow interest groups have made graft the principal catalyst for
                            bureaucratic action. Because any far-reaching attempt to rationalize the
                            bureaucracy would threaten the livelihood of so many people, no
                            Indonesian government can easily or quickly change the situation.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> has circumvented the
                            problem of the civil bureaucracy in part by placing military officers in
                            key positions throughout the administrative structure. The army is the
                            most cohesive and nationally-oriented institution within Indonesia;
                            hence, it is the best available instrument for the gigantic task of
                            modernization. After more than 20 <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0607"/>years of active involvement in civil affairs, the army
                            leadership has a sense of national mission which generally transcends
                            the ethnic, religious, and geographic divisions that have made it so
                            difficult to mold together the Indonesian nation. The officer corps is
                            relatively well educated and, under strong direction, could become an
                            effective force for modernization and reform.</p>
                        <p>14. There are, however, severe limitations on the ability of the military
                            to administer governmental policies effectively. These limitations are
                            not peculiar to the army itself, but rather are functions of broader
                            cultural and physical facts of Indonesian life. The basic problem of
                            distance between Djakarta and the outlying provinces is magnified by the
                            woefully inadequate system of transportation and communication. Even if
                            the latter were rehabilitated over the next few years, the central
                            government in Java would still lack the resources and the inclination to
                            meet the needs of the outer islands. As a result, the government's
                            administrative structure, while highly centralized in theory, has
                            considerable de facto regional and local autonomy. Except for the unity
                            and discipline that the army's command structure itself provides, the
                            policies of the central government fail to grip or affect the lives of
                            the plantation worker on the rubber estate in Sumatra, the small Islamic
                            trader at the bazaar in Central Java, or the displaced
                            nobleman-turned-entrepreneur on Bali. The resultant inefficiency serves
                            only to reinforce the prevalent Indonesian tendency to rely on personal
                            relationships to get things done.</p>
                        <p>15. Although there is, of course, a severe shortage of able
                            administrators in Indonesia, the greatest obstacle to effective
                            government is probably Indonesian culture itself. Among the dominant
                            Javanese in particular, but also among Indonesians generally, cultural
                            values inhibit the imposition of the kinds of social discipline that are
                            characteristic of the economically advanced countries of Asia, Europe,
                            and North America. Even the Western-trained members of the governing
                            elite are generally reluctant to employ modest forms of coercion to prod
                            their own people, or themselves for that matter, to change their ways.
                            The government, as a consequence, asks extraordinarily little of itself
                            or its citizens. There are few obligations either to do things in the
                            common interest or to avoid actions opposed to it. Indeed, the
                            traditional culture is so strong, and the vested interests are so great,
                            that it is extremely difficult to circumvent the existing power
                            structure or to change the established ways of doing things.</p>
                        <p>16. Indonesian society is based on a complex fabric of personal
                            relationships, patronage, and paternalism known as “bapakism.”<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">“Bapak” means both “father” and “boss.”
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Although <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0608"/>to most Westerners “bapakism” may
                            appear to be merely a systematic form of graft, it has useful as well as
                            negative aspects. Men are held responsible for their actions, so that
                            the initiative and effort of the man who “produces” within the system is
                            rewarded. Thus, men of talent and ingenuity are able to rise within the
                            generally stratified, traditionalist society. The problem is that the
                            system gives a decisive role to personal contacts and minimal importance
                            to formal restraints. Few, if any, institutions are disciplined by
                            impersonal rules of behavior. As a result, corruption within Indonesia
                            is less the product of laxity in law enforcement than of a social system
                            that values honesty well below loyalty and resourcefulness. Because of
                            the prevalence and pervasiveness of “bapakism,” only a revolutionary
                            regime unconcerned with either stability or humaneness would dare to
                            tackle the problem directly at its roots.</p>
                        <p rend="center">C. Economic Problems</p>
                        <p>17. A seriously dilapidated economy is the legacy of two decades of
                            mismanagement and neglect: agriculture is inefficient; the industrial
                            sector, though beginning to recover, is still small and backward; and
                            communications and public services are in disarray. The vast majority of
                            Indonesians live in extreme rural poverty and are largely insulated from
                            the fluctuations of the money economy. At present rates of increase, the
                            population of 115 million will double in 20-odd years. Problems of
                            overcrowding and extreme poverty are particularly acute on Java, where
                            about two-thirds of the people live. The standard of living of the
                            average person is probably lower now than it was at the beginning of the
                            Second World War. But it is significant that in recent months the
                            Indonesian economy has begun to show signs of improvement.</p>
                        <p>18. With aid and guidance from the industrialized nations of the free
                            world, the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government has
                            attacked the corrosive problem of inflation. The current rate of two
                            percent per month is hardly satisfactory, but it is a substantial
                            achievement compared with the runaway inflation of earlier years. The
                            shortage of food, particularly rice, has been a key factor in causing
                            inflation. Western assistance in supplying large quantities of rice and
                            other foodstuffs, and reorganization of the Indonesian Government's rice
                            procurement and distribution system, have played decisive roles in
                            reducing the problem significantly during the ordinarily lean winter
                            months. Over the longer term, Indonesia will require considerably
                            greater use of fertilizers, pesticides and new seed strains, as well as
                            the improvement of irrigation facilities, if food production is to meet
                            the demands of the soaring population. Greater self-sufficiency in rice
                            is essential if inflation is to be curbed.</p>
                        <p>19. Government spending has also been an important cause of inflation. At
                            the insistence of the International Monetary Fund, <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s team of Western-trained
                            economists has tightened administrative <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0609"/>controls over the budget. Subsidies on certain consumer
                            items such as kerosene, gasoline, electricity, and public transport have
                            been cut; tax collection has been improved; and the number of employees
                            in at least one state enterprise (Garuda Indonesian Airways) has been
                            cut back. These measures have not been popular, of course, but they have
                            been constructive.</p>
                        <p>20. A second major economic problem facing Indonesia is the need for
                            investment. There is little private domestic capital in Indonesia, even
                            in comparison with other poor countries. Much that does exist is in the
                            hands of ethnic Chinese who are concentrated in the export-import and
                            wholesale-retail trades. Because of widespread hostility against them,
                            the Chinese are generally not disposed to make new, long term
                            investments, particularly in fields in which they are not already well
                            established.</p>
                        <p>21. An essential part of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government's economic program, therefore, has
                            been to welcome foreign capital back to Indonesia. Already about 25
                            American and European firms have recovered control of mines, estates,
                            and other enterprises nationalized under <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. In addition, liberal legislation has been
                            enacted to attract new private foreign investment. Tax incentives are
                            offered and the rights of managerial control, repatriation of profits,
                            and compensation in the event of expropriation are, in large measure,
                            guaranteed. The prospects for private foreign investment in extractive
                            industries are fairly good, but it will take several years before survey
                            and exploratory work can pay off in large-scale production, export
                            earnings, and tax revenues. Some of Indonesia's traditional export
                            industries such as rubber, tin, and copra are on the decline because of
                            inadequate maintenance over the years and falling prices on the world
                            market. Nevertheless, there is substantial foreign interest in new
                            investment in relatively untapped resources of nickel, copper, bauxite,
                            and timber. The most promising industry, from the standpoints of both
                            foreign capital and Indonesian economic growth, is oil. Crude
                            production, chiefly from the fields of Caltex<note n="5" xml:id="d262fn5">Caltex, which is jointly owned by the Texas Company
                                and the Standard Oil Company of California, weathered the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> years better than any
                                of its competitors. In 1968, it made the largest new investment of
                                any firm in Indonesia, $24 million. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> in Central Sumatra, now averages 600,000 barrels per
                            day, and daily output will probably exceed one million barrels within
                            the next three years. On balance, however, Indonesia's export earnings
                            (and, therefore, much needed foreign exchange) will probably grow
                            slowly, not increasing substantially before the mid-1970's.</p>
                        <p>22. A third major problem is Indonesia's tremendous foreign debt of $2.7
                            billion. The related problem of the balance of payments will be <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0610"/>compounded if an attempt is
                            made to repay the debt. Indonesia's free-world creditors have deferred
                            and rescheduled the debt to them coming due each year since 1966, and
                            are now undertaking an overall appraisal of Indonesia's capacity to
                            begin repayment in the 1970's. They will probably decide to stretch out
                            further the payment of the more than $1.5 billion owed to them.
                            Indonesia has already defaulted on some payments due on its debt of
                            about $1.2 billion to Communist states, and there is strong feeling in
                            some quarters against repaying this debt (which is chiefly for arms and
                            prestige projects from the USSR).</p>
                        <p>23. A closely related issue is that of new foreign aid. Although much
                            that needs to be done in Indonesia is neither dependent on nor amenable
                            to foreign aid, there is little hope for economic progress without it.
                            The Intergovernmental Group (<gloss target="#t_IGG1">IGG</gloss>), led
                            by the US, has granted substantial economic assistance to Indonesia
                            since 1966. Of the roughly $325 million contributed in 1968 (about $250
                            million for imports to stabilize prices and the remaining $75 million
                            for investment projects), the US and Japan each provided approximately
                            one-third. It will take considerable prodding to get Japan to continue
                            to match the US contribution, although Japan, West Germany, the
                            Netherlands, and Australia can be expected to provide sizable amounts of
                            aid. The Western and Japanese donors insist that their aid not be
                            siphoned off to repay Indonesia's debt to Communist countries and other
                            countries that are not providing offsetting assistance. It is noteworthy
                            that the World Bank has decided to give special priority to Indonesia,
                            having established in Djakarta its first permanent mission to any
                            less-developed country.</p>
                        <p>24. Over the short term, Communist countries are likely to provide little
                            if any additional aid to Indonesia. Over the past year, the USSR has
                            sent less than a hundred technicians and has sold about $3 million worth
                            of spare parts on a strictly cash basis to Indonesia. It has extended no
                            loans or credits to the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government, and the status of unspent portions of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>-era credits has not been
                            resolved.</p>
                        <p rend="center">D. Prospects</p>
                        <p>25. What is principally at stake in Indonesia over the next few years is
                            whether a pragmatic, forward-looking government such as <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>'s can generate sufficient
                            progress to win enduring support.</p>
                        <p>26. The pace of economic progress will almost certainly be slow, but this
                            fact will probably prove more frustrating to the moderate leadership
                            elements within Indonesia and their friends abroad than to the great
                            mass of Indonesians. The latter, and particularly the Javanese, are
                            generally passive in the face of authority. Under <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> they tolerated years of
                            economic folly and neglect; a few more years of economic hardship will
                            not make much difference to them. Indeed, <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0611"/>the vast majority of Indonesians have little notion
                            that any condition other than poverty is possible for them. They will
                            probably be able to subsist even though economic conditions should
                            appreciably worsen.</p>
                        <p>27. The present leadership will probably be able to cope with the
                            domestic situation for the next two to three years. Inflation will
                            probably be kept within tolerable limits, and some new private foreign
                            investment will be forthcoming. Indonesia's free-world creditors are
                            likely to stretch out the payment of Indonesia's debt to them and also
                            provide substantial foreign aid.<note n="6" xml:id="d262fn6">Indonesia
                                has requested $500 million in aid for 1969 but about $150 million of

                                will be available for disbursement in 1969. This is probably about
                                all that Indonesia can absorb. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            In future years, of course, a number of factors quite apart from the

                            donors to extend such high levels of aid.</p>

                            problems for the government over the next few years, but these should be
                            manageable. However, the slow pace of economic progress may become an
                            issue by 1971, when the government will also face mounting pressure to
                            honor its commitment to hold elections. The old-line parties and other
                            groups will try to find ways to embarrass the government and advance
                            their own ends, and there will probably be occasional instances of civil
                            unrest, particularly in the larger towns and cities. By 1971, it is also
                            possible, although highly unlikely, that the Indonesian Communists could
                            be reorganized sufficiently to mount a sustained campaign of terror or
                            to begin to form a new leftist political coalition.</p>
                        <p>29. If the domestic situation does deteriorate, the army will almost
                            certainly grow less tolerant of dissent. If the government became
                            alarmed at a real or imagined threat to internal security, it would
                            probably postpone elections once again. Though we do not judge it
                            likely, the moderate leadership might also be set aside and replaced by
                            a more authoritarian government. But in either event, the military will
                            almost certainly be able to maintain its grip on power.</p>

                        <p>30. The foreign policies of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government are characterized by pragmatism,
                            caution, and moderation. As a consequence of <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0612"/>the fall of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the havoc wreaked on the Indonesian
                            Communists, the close ties that used to characterize Indonesian
                            relations with Communist countries have been greatly weakened. Contacts
                            between Djakarta and Moscow have cooled considerably, and relations with
                            Peking have deteriorated to the present state of open antagonism. On the
                            other hand, Indonesia has grown increasingly receptive to the aid and
                            investment of the industrialized countries of the free world. Thus,
                            while maintaining formal nonalignment, Djakarta is in fact drifting
                            closer toward the Western camp.</p>
                        <p>31. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government has
                            forsaken <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>'s conception
                            of Indonesia as the champion of the “new emerging forces” of the
                            underdeveloped world, and taken a more realistic attitude toward
                            Indonesia's international position. Thus, the “New Order” has sought to
                            improve relations with Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia's neighbors
                            in Southeast Asia. The “confrontation” against Malaysia has given way to
                            cooperation in an attempt to suppress a few hundred Communist insurgents
                            in northwestern Borneo. Then, too, the hostility that persists between
                            Singapore and Indonesia—born of economic dependence and racial
                            animosity—has generally been kept below the surface, though the recent
                            anti-Chinese outbursts in Surabaja have revealed its explosive
                            potential. Moreover, the regime's restrained response to popular demands
                            for retaliation against Singapore was a victory for the moderate
                            leadership of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>. Finally, Djakarta has offered to do whatever it
                            can to resolve the dispute between Manila and Kuala Lumpur over
                            Sabah.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>32. The new moderation in Indonesian foreign relations is based on
                            careful calculation of Indonesia's national interests. Indonesians see
                            themselves as potentially the dominant power of the Malay world—and
                            possibly of all Southeast Asia. They seem to have learned, however, that
                            the aggressive policies of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did more to damage than to promote the kind of
                            leadership that Indonesia seeks. Thus, the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government has chosen to follow the path of
                            regional cooperation instead of conflict. As the prime mover in the
                            formation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>), Indonesia is actively attempting
                            to improve its economic and cultural relations with its fellow
                            members—Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>
                        <p>33. Although Djakarta is apprehensive about the intentions and the power
                            of Communist China, it foresees no major external threat to its own
                            security over the next few years. It believes that the main threat to
                            itself and other nations of Southeast Asia lies in internal Communist
                            subversion designed to capitalize on their economic and social
                            weaknesses. As a result, Indonesia believes that the major effort of
                            these nations should be devoted to improving the condition of their
                            people <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0613"/>and strengthening their
                            internal security organizations. There is little belief in the
                            feasibility of putting military teeth into <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> or any other strictly regional grouping under present
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>34. Indonesia hopes that the Western presence in Southeast Asia will be
                            maintained until the nations of the area are capable of assuming a
                            regional security role themselves. Basically, the present government
                            would like to have the US involved somehow in the protection of the area
                            against China, yet it would not favor a direct security relationship
                            with the US or any other outside power, lest this cast doubt on
                            Indonesia's nonaligned image or hinder any future effort by Indonesia to
                            assert its primacy among the Malay peoples. The army would perhaps be
                            more favorably disposed to a US-supported regional security arrangement
                            than would various civilian elements.</p>
                        <p>35. Indonesia will continue to be particularly reluctant to join any
                            regional grouping which carries a patently anti-Communist label. Leading
                            civilians, including Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, apparently assume that eventual Communist success
                            in all of Indonesia is virtually inevitable. They are not particularly
                            apprehensive about such a denouement, however, because they anticipate
                            that it would increase Hanoi's independence of Peking and lead to a
                            greater Soviet role in the region that would counterbalance the power of
                            Communist China. The military, including General <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>, is less pessimistic about the
                            prospects in Vietnam and the rest of Indochina but far more apprehensive
                            that an enlarged Soviet presence in the region would be used to subvert
                            the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government.</p>
                        <p>C. Indonesia and the Great Powers</p>
                        <p>36. Relations between Moscow and Djakarta have been on the downgrade
                            since October 1965. The USSR is increasingly disturbed by the continuing
                            vigor of the government's anticommunism and by Djakarta's growing
                            dependence on the US, Western Europe, and Japan for aid and investment.
                            Moscow would like to woo the beleaguered Indonesian Communists away from
                            the Maoist tactics that they have been following. So long as the present
                            trend toward Indonesian friendship with the free world continues, Moscow
                            will probably continue its criticism of the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government and enlarge its efforts to develop a
                            resurgent leftist threat in Indonesia. Thus, the USSR's present cool but
                            correct, cash-on-the-line economic relations with Indonesia could
                            worsen.</p>
                        <p>37. For its part, the <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>
                            government probably does not want its relations with the USSR to
                            deteriorate further. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName>, in particular, would like to balance Indonesia's
                            increasing reliance on the Western countries and Japan by keeping lines
                            open to Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Malik</persName> probably
                            considers that continuing nonalignment is in <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0614"/>Indonesia's long-term national interest, for it would
                            hold out the prospect of receiving aid from both East and West and offer
                            more room for diplomatic maneuver. Though the military probably wants to
                            continue to be able to obtain spare parts from Moscow in order to
                            maintain its equipment, it might be less concerned about offending the
                            USSR. It probably sees a brighter future for Indonesia and itself in
                            building up ties with the free world.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Contingencies</p>
                        <p>38. The <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> government is not
                            currently inclined toward a bellicose or chauvinistic posture, and it
                            will probably remain fairly moderate in its foreign policies. So long as
                            the domestic situation does not deteriorate and so long as Indonesia can
                            rely on economic assistance from the free world, it will have strong
                            incentives to continue on its present course. Although economic
                            progress, even with substantial foreign aid, will almost certainly be
                            slow, the free world will probably want to continue to give Indonesia
                            support. The key to Indonesian foreign as well as domestic policy,
                            therefore, will be whether the Indonesians themselves maintain
                            confidence in a pragmatic approach to their very serious problems.</p>
                        <p>39. In the unlikely event that the present moderate leadership of
                            Indonesia were replaced by a less responsible government, the
                            consequences for Indonesian foreign policy might be extremely serious.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was able to
                            divert the attention of Indonesians of the right as well as the left
                            from problems at home by pursuing an aggressive policy abroad. A pattern
                            of belligerence could emerge once again. It could be fueled by doctrines
                            of a greater pan-Malay nationalism; likely targets would be Singapore
                            and Malaysia. Such a prospect is remote at the moment, but Indonesian
                            ambitions and a latent strain of aggressiveness are factors that should
                            not be lost sight of.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister of Malaysia will seek to convince us that Indonesia
                            intends to carry out its avowed policy of crushing Malaysia and driving
                            the West from the area, thus complementing Communist strategy in
                            Southeast Asia.<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">In a Special Report <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> No. 00612/64B, March 27, prepared by
                                the Office of Current Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency
                                concluded that Indonesia's policy of confrontation had diverted
                                attention from Malaysia's serious internal problems, primarily
                                communal friction among the Chinese and Malays throughout Malaysia,
                                Malays on Borneo and on the mainland, and between Chinese elements
                                on the mainland and the rest of Malaysia. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> stated that the federal government
                                “apparently is either not interested in pulling the four disparate
                                parts of Malaysia together or is unable to do so. Malaya (the
                                mainland), Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak are scarcely more united
                                now than they were when formally merged last September.” The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> suggested that without the
                                “cohesive effect of the Indonesia confrontation, the federation
                                might already be disintegrating.” (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Malaysia, Vol. I, Memos,
                                11/63–3/64)</note> He will seek to demonstrate the need for the
                            United States to provide forthright, concrete support for Malaysia in
                            the face of Indonesian confrontation. He will indicate, if not state,
                            his opposition to the continuation of our aid to Indonesia in any
                            form.</p>
                        <p>Our problem is to reaffirm our support for Malaysia and make some
                            tangible gesture of encouragement without involving the United States in
                            either the substance of the dispute or in substantial new commitments in
                            Southeast Asia, and without needless aggravation of our relations with
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>There are several alternatives:</p>
                        <p>1) Economic Assistance Program.</p>
                        <p>Such a program cannot be justified at this time since Malaysia has a
                            relatively good economic situation, possibilities of additional revenues
                            through taxation, substantial reserves and unexploited opportunities for
                            borrowing from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, other friendly
                            western governments and commercial sources.</p>
                        <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0616"/>
                        <p>2) Other Types of U.S. Assistance.</p>
                        <p>There are 330 Peace Corps Volunteers in Malaysia at present and there is
                            little possibility of expanding this program. We are informally
                            assisting the Malaysians in locating sources of technical information,
                            facilities for training in U.S. Government and private institutions, and
                            intend to expand this so-called “non-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            aid” which does not require any special budgeting of U.S. funds. We have
                            already informed the Government of Malaysia of this activity.</p>
                        <p>3) Military Sales on Credit Basis.</p>
                        <p>We have told the Malaysians on several occasions that we would be willing
                            to assist them in the purchase of military equipment in the U.S. and to
                            explore all available U.S. Government and commercial sources of credit
                            to secure the best possible terms once they had submitted firm requests
                            for material. They recently requested price and availability data on
                            certain heavy military equipment (armored personnel carriers and
                            anti-aircraft guns). We propose to meet this and future requests for
                            such information and to sell such equipment on the best credit terms
                            available to the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>4) Military Training.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister has informally expressed an interest in training
                            Malaysian officers in the U.S. We believe a small military training
                            program, involving not more than ten officers and costing approximately
                            $100,000 a year, would offer important political advantages at low cost.
                            It would demonstrate both to Malaysia and to Indonesia U.S. support for
                            Malaysia in concrete terms. Indonesia could not logically take exception
                            to such a program since Indonesian officers are already being trained in
                            the U.S. Such a program would also give us contact with young Malaysian
                            officers who may become national leaders in the future.</p>
                        <p>5) Public Statement of U.S. Support for Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>I believe we should use the joint communiqué which will be issued after
                            the Prime Minister's meeting with the President to reaffirm our support
                            for Malaysia, but that we should not agree to language criticizing or
                            commenting on Indonesia's policy of confrontation. To do the latter
                            would neither add to Malaysian strength nor contribute to a relaxation
                            of confrontation and might instead encourage greater Indonesian
                            intransigence. We should be pro-Malaysia, not anti-Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>If response to criticism of our aid to Indonesia is indicated, I suggest
                            we point out that unlike Malaysia, the structure of the Indonesian
                            government rests entirely on one man; that we must look beyond <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to the uncertainty perhaps
                            chaos which is likely to follow his departure from the scene; that in
                            our common interest we must maintain contact with elements in Indonesia
                            that can prevent an outright Communist takeover; that our assistance to
                            Indonesia is carefully <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0617"/>screened
                            to eliminate elements which would contribute to Indonesia's ability to
                            prosecute its military pressure on Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> approved all three
                                recommendations on July 15.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1) That we suggest to the Prime Minister that the Chief of the Armed
                            Forces Staff of Malaysia be invited to the U.S. to visit U.S. military
                            training establishments with a view to the possibility of setting up a
                            small U.S. military training program for Malaysian officers.</p>
                        <p>2) That we reaffirm to the Malaysians our willingness to assist them in
                            securing the best credit terms available for the purchase of military
                            equipment, and that we ask the Department of Defense to provide the
                            Government of Malaysia with appropriate information on military
                            equipment in which they express an interest.</p>
                        <p>3) That we recommend to the President that a forthright statement of our
                            support for Malaysia be included in the communiqué covering talks with
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>, but that we also
                            recommend against the use of this communiqué as a vehicle for
                            castigating Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>Cambridge-educated, fluent in English, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> (Prince) is a warmhearted, genial man of 61 who is
                            known as the father of his multiracial nation.</p>
                        <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0618"/>
                        <p>A skilled politician, he was a principal leader in the 1948–60 fight
                            against Communist terrorism, led the country to independence in 1957 and
                            has since dominated Malayan and Malaysian politics.</p>
                        <p>He visited here in the fall of 1960, is strongly anti-Communist and
                            friendly to the West.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. His State of Mind</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> is deeply troubled by
                            almost two years of Indonesian hostility to Malaysia. He comes from
                            strenuous efforts to win further support from the Commonwealth
                            Conference in London.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. His Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. To explain Malaysia's position as the aggrieved party in the
                            Indonesia-Malaysia dispute.</p>
                        <p>2. To place Indonesia's “crush Malaysia” campaign in the context of the
                            Communist strategy of driving the West out of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. To evoke (a) a more forthright American public statement supporting
                            Malaysia against Indonesia, and (b) some tangible demonstration of this
                            support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Our Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. To emphasize our determination to resist Communist efforts to drive us
                            out of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. To reaffirm our support of Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>3. To explain the rationale of our Indonesian policy.</p>
                        <p>4. To prevent the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s visit
                            from exacerbating the Malaysia-Indonesia problem and poisoning our
                            relations with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Major Topics of Your Talks Are Expected To Be: </p>
                        <p>1. U.S.-Malaysian Relations</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> will express
                            satisfaction with our relations and gratitude for your statements of
                            support for Malaysia and the Peace Corps program.</p>
                        <p>2. Indonesian Confrontation</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> will discuss the
                            economic and military burden of resistance to Indonesia and, without
                            directly asking for it, imply that Malaysia merits aid as a beleaguered
                            standard bearer for the West in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>He will cite the recent Mikoyan visit to Indonesia as evidence that
                            confrontation serves the Communist effort to drive the West from
                            Southeast Asia. He will maintain that U.S. aid to Indonesia, even at its
                            present low level, serves to prop up <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and harass Malaysia.</p>
                        <p rend="center">You might say:</p>
                        <p>We are proving in Viet-Nam our determination to resist Communist
                            aggression. (Note Malaysia's assistance to Viet-Nam in training and
                            material.)</p>

                        <p>Both you and President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            have expressed publicly U.S. support of Malaysia, which we are prepared
                            to reaffirm. As further evidence of our position we would propose to
                            invite the Malaysian Chief of Staff, General Osman, to visit the United
                            States to inspect our military schools to help develop a training
                            program for Malaysian officers.</p>
                        <p>We have no illusions about <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. But Indonesia, now and in the future, is of the
                            utmost importance to all of us, not least to Malaysia itself. Our aid to
                            Indonesia has been sharply reduced and we are satisfied that it is not
                            helping Indonesia militarily. It is, however, permitting us to maintain
                            some contact with key elements in Indonesia which are interested in and
                            capable of resisting Communist takeover. We think this is of vital
                            importance to the entire Free World.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s patient
                            efforts to reach a negotiated settlement with Indonesia. Note continuing
                            efforts of the Philippines and Thailand to assist. The door should be
                            kept open for an Asian settlement, and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> should seek to improve his relations with the

                            <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s Meeting with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> noted that the
                            President had met privately with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and that we were interested in learning the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s understanding of what
                            had happened. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> said that
                            he had talked with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> in
                            general about the visit, and had found him extremely pleased at the
                            nature of his reception and at the President's warmth. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> that he and the President had
                            discussed Malaysia's current problems, and reported that the President
                            had offered help in the form of military training and sales of military
                            equipment. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> had not
                            expressed interest in details on these two subjects and would leave it
                            up to his “technical people” to work matters out with us. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> expected that the next step
                            would be for Inche Abdul Kadir bin Shamsudin (Secretary for Defense) to
                            go into more detail with Defense in regard to general types of equipment
                            and training needed as well as financial considerations, but felt that
                            no precise agreements would be sought by the Malaysian side at present.
                            He seemed aware that the President had suggested that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> send General Osman to the United
                            States, and thought that Osman's visit might be a good time for more
                            precise equipment sales arrangements to be made. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> felt that the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> was more concerned about the
                            general friendly atmosphere he had encountered than in the precise
                            nature of the military arrangements discussed.</p>

                            hesitation. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>
                            explained to him that we could not use a word like “assistance” in
                            referring to what we were willing to do to help Malaysia, as this
                            carried with it, in a military situation, the connotation that we would
                            be willing to commit troops to the defense of Malaysia. This, the
                            Governor said, we were not contemplating. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> made it clear that he quite understood our
                            position and that he was well aware that American troops would not be
                            engaged.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> said that during his last
                            visit to Kuala Lumpur <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> had
                            specifically told him and most of the cabinet, individually and
                            collectively, that the Philippines would normalize its relations with
                            Malaysia if the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> went to the
                            summit meeting in Tokyo. As a result, the Malaysians feel that they have
                            been let down. He indicated the usual Malaysian lack of respect for the
                            Sabah claim, but felt that the subject could be satisfactorily handled
                            if the Filipinos would abandon their present insistence on reference of
                            the case to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>, and would agree
                            instead to meet bilaterally with Malaysia to discuss the political and
                            financial implications of the claim and to seek joint agreement as to
                            what channel should be used in trying to resolve it. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> noted that Malaysia would have
                            great constitutional problems if it agreed to the International Court in
                            advance, as this would require currently unobtainable approval by the
                            Sabah legislature. He felt that, if Sabah representatives were included
                            in the preliminary talks with the Filipinos however and these talks
                            reached the agreed conclusion that the Court was the only suitable
                            channel, Sabah would be willing to go along. He felt, however, that
                            Philippine opposition to Malaysia had tapered off, and was not a problem
                            any longer.</p>
                        <p>In regard to general Philippine policy, <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> agreed to the general assessment that the
                            Philippines has moved from support of Indonesia to general neutrality,
                            but characterized Philippine policy as still being based on their
                            assumption that they had a useful moderating role to play. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> said that perhaps they did have
                            such a role, but indicated that he did not think so. He agreed that at
                            this point President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            seems to be genuinely anxious to reach a settlement, but seemed in no
                            way disappointed that <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName> had
                            apparently withdrawn from the picture.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> expressed the view that
                            the basic trouble with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is that he is extremely badly informed both
                            about conditions in his country and about foreign attitudes towards it.
                            He affirmed his view that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not a Communist but felt that Communist
                            influence on him is very great and that the strength of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is increasing. He dismissed <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> as having no further real
                            capacity for major influence in Indonesia and seemed to feel that
                            General Yani was much more likely to be the leading military man in the
                            period ahead. At the same time, he called Yani a complete opportunist,
                            said that Yani had been brought to Tokyo by <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, and made it clear that
                            he regards Yani as being currently lined up with <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Yani Visit</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> said that we
                            were considering whether it would be useful to invite Yani to the United
                            States, that we were <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0622"/>inclined
                            to feel our ties with the top Indonesian military were still of value,
                            but that we had reached no decision and would be glad to have any
                            Malaysian reaction. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> did
                            not pick up this gambit and clearly did not express opposition to the
                            move. No timing for the visit was mentioned.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future of Indonesia</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> that, although Indonesia is under heavy
                            economic strain as a result of confrontation, there was no real prospect
                            that economic pressure alone would be sufficient to cause a dramatic
                            overturn in political affairs in Indonesia in the near future. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> admitted that various
                            Malaysians were asserting publicly that the end was in sight in
                            Indonesia, but wrote this off as political talk. He did, however, feel
                            that the current deterioration will inevitably have a cumulative effect
                            even in a demonetized society like Indonesia, and said that unless
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made major
                            changes the country was headed for collapse. Coming back to his previous
                            assertion that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is
                            uninformed, he felt that it was essential in some way to make <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> realize that he could not
                            win through confrontation, that he could not succeed in crushing
                            Malaysia, and that, in effect, his current high-voiced anti-colonialism
                            was possible only because he was protected by the Seventh Fleet. The
                            corollary which he drew was that the United States should make these
                            things clear to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He
                            was assured that we have repeatedly done so, and that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> seems to be well aware of
                            Indonesia's current dependence on American power for protection from
                            China.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName>'s preferred solution to
                            the whole problem emerged as requiring change in the nature of the
                            Indonesian Government, authority being returned to the people of the
                            individual islands, the central government in Djakarta being removed or
                            downgraded as the source of power, and a federal system like that in the
                            United States or Malaysia being installed. If such a system were
                            developed, according to <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName>,
                            Malaysia would be willing to be a part of it, and this in his view would
                            be the only way of keeping Communism out of the area. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> advanced the interesting theory
                            that had Sun Yat-sen not unified China we would not today be faced by a
                            Communist-controlled unified China, and, when this theory seemed to
                            produce less than complete agreement, advanced the further idea that
                            Europe today is not Communist because it has been “Balkanized,” his
                            point being that, had large states like the Austro-Hungarian Empire
                            persisted, one or another of them would have become Communist and “half
                            of Europe” would be lost to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Asked what he thought the chances were of such a breakup in the
                            Indonesian political structure, <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> noted that regional feelings were strong in the
                            country, and especially so in Sumatra and Sulawesi. He <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0623"/>could cite no current dissidence in
                            Sumatra but said he was in very close touch with the situation and with
                            many responsible Sumatran leaders and was convinced that Sumatra is “on
                            the move.” In regard to Sulawesi, he said that he was in extremely close
                            touch with the situation and that there were now more than 23,000 rebel
                            troops under arms. <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> said
                            that Malaysia was quite capable of taking advantage of this situation,
                            but insisted that his country is not taking action to do so as yet. He
                            felt that when the time came the mistakes of 1958 should be avoided,
                            that the United States and the West should stay out of the picture, and
                            that Malaysia should be the power to stimulate action, using Indonesians
                            with whom it is in contact.</p>
                        <p>(In a subsequent conversation with Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>, in the
                            car going to the White House, <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> further embroidered the theme of Indonesia being
                            turned into a federated state and indeed being ultimately joined with
                            Malaysia on a federated basis. He repeated his belief that there was
                            strong separatist sentiment particularly in Sumatra and Sulawesi, and
                            said that he was afraid we, the United States, did not have adequate
                            information on this trend of thought. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            noted that the former Sumatra leaders had all been driven out as a
                            result of the 1958 rebellion, and wondered where leadership might be
                            found for any such movement. He also mentioned the Masjumi elements, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> replied that they
                            were merely one of many groups that had this separatist feeling.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> went on to imply
                            strongly that Malaysia would be doing all it could to find and stimulate
                            such sentiment. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> responded that, while
                                <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName>'s vision of a
                            federated state for the whole area might be an eventual possibility for
                            good, any Malaysian effort in this direction at the present time would
                            be playing a “dangerous game” and might have the effect—as the 1958
                            rebellion had had—of further uniting Indonesia. This conversation was
                            brief, and the matter was not really followed to any kind of conclusion.
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName>'s theory is
                            apparently somewhat more than a parlor speculation, at least as far as
                            he himself is concerned.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Indonesian Terrorism</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> characterized current
                            Indonesian terrorism in Malaya and Singapore as “very low level” but
                            said that it was a great nuisance and that the Malaysians were giving
                            considerable thought to retaliation in kind. One school felt that the
                            Malaysians should knock out subversive bases in neighboring Indonesian
                            territory, presumably the Riau Islands, but that he felt this would be
                            rather futile and that the way to strike back was through sponsoring
                            similar terrorist activity in Indonesia by discontented Indonesians.
                            Here again, he emphasized that all this was still in the discussion
                            stage and that Malaysia was not acting. He added, however, that he had
                            told Suwito (Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister) that Malaysia had the
                            capacity to indulge in counter-terrorism and had <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0624"/>warned <persName corresp="#p_SK1">Suwito</persName> that Indonesia should not take the chance of
                            turning this on.</p>

                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> reviewed current
                            Soviet policy in Southeast Asia, concluding that the Soviets were no
                            longer interested in playing the major Communist role in this area, that
                            they would probably be quite willing to see the Chinese Communists get a
                            “bloody nose” from time to time, but that they recognized that the
                            Chinese would be the major Communist influence in the area. He suggested
                            that, as Malaysia is as firmly interested as we are in keeping Communist
                            power from dominating the area, we and Malaysia should be in close and

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s position: Now seems
                            clear separation rammed through Parliament at insistence of <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> who told alliance <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>'s in meeting preceding Parliament opening

                            necessary to carry constitutional amendment legalizing separation. This

                            and although by own admission he was too weak prevent likely racial

                            over separation to point of openly making bitter and indiscreet

                            also to at least some portions of opposition. Lim Cheong Eu, head of

                            seemed more concerned this necessity than anything else.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. With the separation of Singapore and Malaysia, the political
                            arrangements between them and with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            have become much more fluid and the entire area is more unstable now
                            than at any time in the past decade. Singapore is more exposed than
                            before; Malaysia is less certain of the loyalty of its Borneo
                            components; and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is less convinced
                            of the value of retaining its military commitment in both Singapore and
                            Malaysia. Internally, the communal rivalries which the Malaysian
                            federation was designed to lessen continue unabated and offer
                            encouragement to disruptive forces from both Communist China and
                            Indonesia. (Para. 29)</p>
                        <p>B. Over the next two years, Singapore's withdrawal from the Malaysian
                            federation is unlikely to alter the basic political power structure <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0631"/>within Singapore or Malaysia.
                            Although periodic flareups with the central government in Kuala Lumpur
                            are likely, Sabah and Sarawak will probably remain within Malaysia but
                            will demand gradually increasing autonomy. (Paras. 4–8, 14–19)</p>
                        <p>C. Political relations between the two countries will be clouded by
                            strong antagonism between their leaders and by mutual suspicions between
                            Malays and ethnic Chinese. These circumstances, as much as practical
                            considerations of national self-interest, will determine the degree of
                            cooperation in economic as well as political affairs. The Malaysian
                            economy is likely to be adversely affected by the loss of Singapore
                            revenues, and Singapore faces a problem of finding new markets. (Paras.
                            9–19)</p>
                        <p>D. Both Malaysia and Singapore are headed toward a nonalignment which
                            would include increased trade with Communist countries and a more active
                            role among the Afro-Asians. Singapore, particularly, is likely to remain
                            critical of US foreign policy. (Paras. 25–28)</p>
                        <p>E. Recent events in Indonesia offer little prospect of early settlement
                            of Confrontation, though military activity is likely to remain at about
                            its current low level. The British would like to reduce their military
                            investment, but will probably continue a substantial commitment in the
                            area for at least the next two or three years. (Paras. 20–24)</p>

                                protectorate of Brunei, chose not to join the new federation.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The union foundered primarily
                            because of a political power struggle, rooted in racial antagonisms,
                            between Malays in Malaya who were determined to preserve their
                            domination of the central government, and ethnic Chinese of Singapore
                            who sought to extend their influence into the Malayan peninsula. Their
                            Prime Ministers—Malaysia's <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul
                                Rahman</persName> and Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew—could not resolve
                            their fundamentally differing views on exactly what Malaysia should
                            become. Singapore's People's Action Party (<gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>) under <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            sought a noncommunal nation, arguing that the constitutional privileges
                            of the Malays should be progressively curtailed. Kuala Lumpur's
                            leadership advocated a much more gradual change, maintaining that the
                            Malays must be protected and assisted until they were able <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0632"/>to hold their own in competition with
                            the Chinese. Bringing the subject of Malay privilege into question at
                            all, especially in public, aroused most Malay leaders.</p>
                        <p>2. Superimposed on this chronic racial problem were personal and economic
                            frictions which forced the issue. There exist strong personal
                            animosities between the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s personal ambitions clashed
                            sharply with those of a number of other central government leaders,
                            including conservative Chinese as well as nationalist Malays. Mutual
                            suspicions exacerbated disagreements between the two governments
                            concerning issues of finance, trade, and industrial development.</p>
                        <p>3. The terms of the separation agreement are vague and only a few
                            technical questions are resolved. For the most part, the agreement
                            merely states good intentions, e.g., there is a broad promise of
                            economic cooperation. The most important provisions are: (a) all
                            treaties, agreements, and conventions between Malaysia and other
                            countries that pertain to Singapore remain in effect; (b) each country
                            agrees not to enter into treaties with foreign countries that would be
                            detrimental to the independence and defense of the other; (c) the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Malaysia will continue to maintain
                            bases and military facilities in Singapore. Thus, because a great deal
                            of interdependence is to continue, much depends on the good will and
                            common sense of the two governments.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Immediate Impact</p>
                        <p>4. The separation of Singapore did not end the contest for power between
                            Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. At least temporarily, it reduced the ability
                            of the principal political parties in each country to encroach upon the
                            political arena of the other. But public acrimony between <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>, which was renewed in
                            mid-September, and <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s plan to
                            resume limited barter trade with Indonesia in the face of very strong
                            opposition from Malaysia have raised tensions once more.</p>
                        <p>5. Despite the unexpected shock of separation, there was no disorder in
                            either Singapore or Malaysia. The Singapore Government acted promptly to
                            take over responsibilities formerly handled by the federal government,
                            and quickly demonstrated that, at least for the present, its own police
                            could cope with local problems of law and order. In fact, communal
                            tensions were actually eased. Singapore's Malay population, only 14
                            percent of the total, was somewhat deflated and a few felt deserted by
                            Kuala Lumpur, but there was no exodus from the island. The local Chinese
                            business community was gratified by the prospect of an end to federal
                            taxes and of reopening profitable commercial relations with
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>6. We see no immediate political threat to the governing People's Action
                            Party either from internal dissension or from the opposition. There may
                            be some shifts in the cabinet and changes in the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>'s <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0633"/>central
                            executive committee. It is even possible that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> might resign or be forced out by
                            his colleagues. Nevertheless, in our view, such changes would not
                            seriously weaken the basic solidarity within the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>. Singapore's present stability in part reflects leftist
                            weakness following a steady government effort during the last two years
                            to reduce Communist influence in the labor movement, student
                            organizations, and the Barisan Sosialis Party (BSP). The <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>'s extensive experience in handling the
                            Communist threat in Singapore and the demonstrated effectiveness of the
                            government's internal security apparatus are almost certainly sufficient
                            to handle any threat to public order likely to occur in the short
                            term.</p>
                        <p>7. Malaysian political stability also appears little affected by the
                            break. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Abdul
                                Rahman</persName>'s Alliance party,<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">A
                                conservative coalition of Malay, Chinese, and Indian parties.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> which has governed in Kuala
                            Lumpur for nearly a decade, is not seriously challenged at present,
                            although some of its Malay and Chinese elements criticized the
                            separation of Singapore. Several opposition parties have joined the
                            Malaysian Solidarity Conference, set up earlier this year as a coalition
                            to oppose the Alliance and to work for a noncommunal Malaysia. Since the
                            separation, they have attempted to embarrass the Kuala Lumpur government
                            by asserting that it is suppressing opposition and stifling the voices
                            of non-Malays. But this charge implies a degree of democracy which in
                            fact has never existed in Malaya and is made by inherently weak
                            political parties that have always operated near the edge of
                            suppression. Moreover, Kuala Lumpur inherited from the British a
                            colonial tradition of stern treatment for acts of sedition and a highly
                            developed internal security system which serves to inhibit political
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>8. Political leaders in both Sabah and Sarawak were angered that the
                            Kuala Lumpur government failed to consult with them before engineering
                            the separation of Singapore. For a week or so, there were demands for
                            plebiscites to determine the future status of these states, and
                            considerable uncertainty whether one or both would opt to follow
                            Singapore's example. However, their total inability to defend themselves
                            and Sarawak's poor economic position forced most leaders of the two
                            states to realize that, at least for the time being, they would be wiser
                            to remain in Malaysia.</p>

                        <p>9. Separation has so far caused virtually no disruption to either economy
                            because only loose economic ties had been created in the <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0634"/>federation. Some harmonization of taxes
                            took place but, outside the field of finance, there was very little
                            cooperation or coordination on economic policies during the two-year
                            life of the union. In particular, a common market—which had been a
                            precondition of Singapore's entry into Malaysia—was not created, and no
                            effective steps had been taken to coordinate industrial policy or
                            economic planning. In fact, additional barriers to internal trade in
                            manufactured goods were erected during 1964–1965 to protect local
                            manufacturing interests.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Singapore</hi>. Entrepot trade and manufacturing
                            are the bases of Singapore's economy, with the British military
                            establishment fulfilling important economic functions as both employer
                            and consumer.<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Singapore's <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> currently stands at approximately
                                US $450 per capita, one of the highest in Asia. Entrepot trade and
                                related activities account for 20–30 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, industrial production for about 14
                                percent, and the British military establishment for 20–25 percent.
                                [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Increased economic growth is
                            necessary to maintain employment and to finance the welfare measures
                            that provide the basis of the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>'s
                            popular support. Although Singapore has been relatively successful in
                            stimulating the growth of domestic industry, a market larger than
                            Singapore's population of under two million must be found. There is
                            little prospect for expanding entrepot trade; neighboring countries are
                            increasingly establishing direct trade links for their primary products
                            and are developing their own industries to replace imports. Singapore
                            could develop along the lines of Hong Kong—once primarily an entrepot,
                            now a manufacturing center—but Singapore's pattern of labor-intensive
                            industrialization, which has been directed at local, Malaysian, and
                            Indonesian markets, would have to be redirected toward world markets. In
                            some degree Singapore will compete with Hong Kong, but lacks its
                            advantages as an established world supplier and as a financial and
                            trading conduit for Communist China.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Malaysia</hi>. The federal government in Kuala
                            Lumpur has lost a potentially important source of revenue. During 1964,
                            Singapore made a net contribution to the federal government of about $13
                            million, and was expected to contribute a larger amount in 1965. While
                            there is no question of Malaysia's economic viability over the next
                            several years, the country's ambitious economic development plans will
                            almost certainly have to be revised downward. Already defense
                            appropriations incurred because of Indonesia's Confrontation campaign
                            have forced some reductions in expenditures for public development.
                            Malaysia's major economic weakness continues to be its heavy dependence
                            on the export of a few basic commodities. The price of rubber has been
                            declining for several years. The prospects for continuing high prices
                            for Malaysia's exports of tin, iron ore, and timber are good, but the
                                <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0635"/>maintenance of current
                            levels of production will require substantial new exploration and
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Prospects</hi>. Both countries have achieved
                            considerable economic growth, but further growth will require increased
                            capital investment, domestic and foreign. Economic assistance for
                            development will almost certainly continue to be provided by
                            international organizations (e.g., <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>), but foreign investors will be reluctant to risk their
                            capital until the political situation is clarified. Competition between
                            Malaysia and Singapore for foreign investment capital will almost
                            certainly intensify. Malaysia's need for Singapore's port facilities and
                            Singapore's need for Malaysia's markets are factors favoring some degree
                            of economic cooperation. However, we believe that for the next year or
                            two, the degree of economic cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia
                            will be determined for the most part by their political relations. The
                            major threats to this cooperation lie in the personal antagonisms
                            between their top leaders and the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>'s
                            intention to continue its political activity in Malaysia. Probably the
                            easiest and most effective way for Malaysia to retaliate against
                            Singapore would be to apply economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>13. The Singapore Government and local merchants will try to expand their
                            exports to as many markets as possible. The merchants of Singapore
                            regard Communist China and Indonesia as offering important
                            opportunities. In fact, however, the possibilities for a significant
                            increase of exports to China in the short run are limited and, though
                            barter trade with Indonesia will probably be resumed, it is unlikely
                            that it will approach pre-Confrontation levels of trade.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Political</p>
                        <p>14. Relations between the present governments of Singapore and Malaysia
                            are unlikely to improve in the next two or three years. We foresee
                            periods of high tension with acrimonious exchanges, though neither side
                            is likely deliberately to foment disorder in the other's territory. As
                            long as the present leaders remain, we see no abatement of personality
                            clashes. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> seems intent
                            on trying to isolate <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> from
                            his colleagues, while <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is
                            convinced that moderate forces in Kuala Lumpur are already in disarray
                            and that Malaysia is seeking to strangle Singapore economically. He
                            further fears that an end to Confrontation might lead to a British
                            military withdrawal from the area. In <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s view, this would remove the major moderating
                            influence on the Malaysian government and raise the spectre of resurgent
                            anti-Chinese, pan-Malay sentiment in both Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Singapore</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss> are
                            unlikely to change their non-Communist orientation. There is no
                            non-Communist alternative to the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss> in
                            Singapore now and none is likely to develop in the next two or three
                            years. The pro-Communist BSP is the only other large, well <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0636"/>organized, and well financed party, and
                            would profit if Lee finds it impossible to meet the basic economic and
                            political needs of the Singapore people. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s heavy reliance on the British bases poses a
                            serious dilemma for him: it exposes him to criticism among Afro-Asian
                            countries as a colonialist stooge, yet the bases are essential to
                            Singapore's defense and make a vital contribution to its economy.
                            Although an occasional demonstration against the bases cannot be ruled
                            out, the BSP and the leftist unions will probably not choose to press
                            the issue because of popular recognition that the bases are important to
                            the working people of Singapore.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Malaysia</hi>. The ruling Alliance party is not
                            seriously challenged by any political opponent; its principal problem
                            lies in the growing divisions within its own ranks. Since separation,
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> has castigated some of
                            the more extreme Malay leaders for exploiting racial issues and has
                            curtailed their power. However, many remain in positions of influence.
                            Over the past two years, younger Malay and Chinese elements in the
                            Alliance have gradually increased their political power and begun to
                            challenge the older, conservative leadership more openly.</p>
                        <p>17. This challenge is not yet such as to threaten the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s position should he choose to
                            retain power. We believe that the jockeying and maneuvering in the
                            Alliance will continue and that, as a consequence, the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> is likely to resign within the
                            next year or so, probably on grounds of ill health. If he leaves the
                            political scene, there appears to be no one else with the necessary
                            stature to cope with the communal issue. His heir-apparent, Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>, in attempting to
                            consolidate his political and governmental power, would probably cater
                            to pan-Malay and extremist views. In any event, during a period of
                            political transition in Kuala Lumpur, compromise and cooperation with
                            Singapore would be even less likely.</p>
                        <p>18. In Sarawak and Sabah, local leaders believe that Singapore's
                            separation has strengthened their positions vis-à-vis the central
                            government, and indeed, top Malaysian officials have felt obliged to
                            give them renewed assurances on defense and developmental aid. Attitudes
                            toward Kuala Lumpur will also be affected by the complex political
                            maneuverings within Sarawak and Sabah, where the strength of parties
                            sympathetic to the Alliance is not so overwhelming as in Malaya itself.
                            In Sabah, an important element of the Alliance periodically comes close
                            to the point of breaking away to form an opposition party. In Sarawak,
                            the moderate Chinese left is strongly sympathetic to the <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss> and has many close ties with Singapore.
                            In addition, Sarawak has a strong Chinese pro-Communist dissident
                            movement with the potential to challenge government control over large
                            areas should the Commonwealth withdraw its troops.</p>

                        <p>19. The future of the Borneo states in Malaysia is highly uncertain.
                            There will probably be periodic flareups of irritation at the Kuala
                            Lumpur government over what Borneo leaders consider its highhanded
                            manner and discrimination against non-Muslims. There is always the
                            possibility that Sarawak or Sabah might decide to withdraw from Malaysia
                            and seek either independence or some type of union with Singapore or
                            neighboring Brunei. On balance, however, we believe that both states
                            will remain within Malaysia, at least for the next year or two, but will
                            demand greater autonomy.</p>

                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Confrontation</hi>. The recent dramatic events in
                            Indonesia—the attempted coup of 30 September and its aftermath—will
                            almost certainly not result in an early settlement of Djakarta's
                            campaign against Malaysia. The anti-Communist military leaders now vying
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> for control of
                            Indonesia are highly nationalistic and interested in expanding
                            Indonesian hegemony. Nevertheless, they are less personally committed to
                            Confrontation than <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            and, at least temporarily, much more concerned with ensuring the
                            internal political and economic health of Indonesia than with foreign
                            adventures. Under these conditions, it is unlikely that Indonesia will
                            raise the level of military activity beyond present small unit actions
                            in Borneo and occasional subversive missions in Malaya itself. Such
                            action would enable the Indonesian military to maintain its
                            nationalistic, anti-imperialistic posture before the Indonesian
                            public.</p>
                        <p>21. The mere possibility of an end to Confrontation disturbs <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss> officials. They are concerned that, in the long run,
                            the Malay fear of the Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore will draw
                            Malaysia and Indonesia closer together. They believe that the Malay
                            leaders of Kuala Lumpur are less apprehensive of eventual domination by
                            Indonesia than of political submersion by the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>22. <hi rend="italic">The British Presence</hi>. The British consider
                            that the separation of Singapore from Malaysia presented them with a
                            variety of problems: a possible threat to the retention of their
                            military facilities in the area; the possible political unreliability of
                            a neutralist-leaning Singapore; and the economic and political
                            weaknesses of Sarawak and Sabah. Separation also intensified Britain's
                            reexamination of its entire military position in Southeast Asia, an
                            important element in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Defense
                            Review already underway. Since Confrontation started, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has increased its forces in the area from
                            about 42,000 to approximately 56,000. Britain's military outlays in
                            Malaysia and Singapore (including the Far East Fleet) are now running at
                            an estimated $900 million a year and constitute by far the largest
                            portion of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s East-of-Suez defense
                            budget.</p>
                        <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0638"/>
                        <p>23. The British must be looking hopefully toward the possibility of a
                            negotiated settlement of Confrontation as an opportunity to reduce their
                            overseas commitments. London also feels that Australia and New Zealand
                            could make a greater contribution to the defense of the area. We
                            believe, however, that for many years to come, Australia and New Zealand
                            will be unable to bear more than a fraction of the military burden in
                            this area and that meanwhile, Malaysia and Singapore will remain almost
                            completely dependent on British military support. The British will
                            probably continue their military commitment in this area for at least
                            the next two or three years.</p>
                        <p>24. The armed forces of Malaysia are probably capable of maintaining
                            internal security within Malaya but not in the Borneo states, and lack
                            the strength necessary to counter significant external aggression. As
                            long as the Commonwealth military presence remains, Malaysia is unlikely
                            significantly to increase its forces much beyond the moderate expansion
                            of the air force and navy already scheduled. It may, however, activate a
                            fourth army brigade to replace the Singapore brigade presently attached
                            to the Malaysian Army in Sarawak. The Singapore Government will probably
                            bring this latter brigade home and make additional modest increases in
                            its ground forces. Singapore may also develop a small naval force for
                            policing its territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>25. <hi rend="italic">The Communist Powers</hi>. So far, neither
                            Communist China nor the USSR has made any political capital out of
                            Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Neither country had established
                            diplomatic relations with Malaysia; neither has yet recognized
                            Singapore. Both will regard their relations with Indonesia as more
                            important than their relations with either Malaysia or Singapore.
                            Communist China probably does not as yet see much opportunity for a new
                            approach to Malaysia and, accordingly, is likely to give more attention
                            to Singapore. Peking might offer economic assistance and diplomatic
                            recognition to Singapore, hoping to persuade <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> to adopt a more friendly attitude
                            and to work toward the elimination of British bases. Publicly the Soviet
                            Union interpreted Singapore's secession as a death-blow to Malaysia and
                            a triumph for Indonesia against British imperialism. Moscow may have
                            doubts concerning Singapore's viability as an independent state, but
                            will probably seek to establish friendly relations with it in order to
                            counteract Chinese influence in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>26. For their part, Malaysia and Singapore have taken the initiative of
                            indicating to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia that they would welcome
                            trade missions and news agency representatives in their respective
                            countries. Diplomatic relations are likely to be established in due
                            course. Malaysia is determined to have no relations with Communist China
                            at present; it has consular relations with the Republic of China and
                            appears to be moving gradually towards a closer relationship. <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0639"/>The present Singapore
                            Government greatly fears the possibility of Chinese Communist influence
                            on its large Chinese population, but is aware of the desires of its
                            Chinese business community to expand exports to the Chinese mainland
                            whenever possible. It will, therefore, move cautiously in the direction
                            of some formal relationship with Communist China. It will welcome a
                            Soviet presence, hoping that this would offset Communist China's
                            influence and split the loyalties of local Communists and leftwing
                            groups.</p>
                        <p>27. <hi rend="italic">Implications for the US</hi>. Both Malaysia and
                            Singapore have become increasingly sensitive in their relations with the
                            US and publicly more critical of US foreign policy: Malaysia has
                            criticized the US for its assistance to Indonesia; Singapore resents
                            what it regards as a demonstrated US preference for Malaysia. Both feel
                            that, because they are non-Communist states, they deserve greater US
                            assistance than they have received. In general, both countries are
                            headed in the same direction with regard to their foreign policies:
                            toward closer relations with nonaligned and Communist countries.
                            However, Malaysia will almost certainly continue to give diplomatic
                            support to US military initiatives in Southeast Asia, if only to ensure
                            US military assistance for itself in a time of real need.</p>
                        <p>28. Singapore's recent relations with the US have been affected to a very
                            high degree by <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s personal
                            and highly emotional antipathy to the US. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> appears convinced that the US distrusts all Chinese
                            and is hostile to nonaligned countries. He apparently believes that, in
                            any showdown between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, the US (unlike the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) would side with the latter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is determined that the
                            British maintain their military presence in Singapore and is
                            particularly concerned lest they be replaced by the US. In his view,
                            this would provoke Communist China's antagonism and make Singapore a
                            pawn in the power struggle in the Far East. Because of Lee's
                            emotionalism and the desire of Singapore's leaders to be accepted among
                            nonaligned nations, we foresee a period of strained Singapore-US
                            relations and expect periodic public outbursts of anti-Americanism from
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>.</p>
                        <p>29. As a consequence of the increased fluidity of the political
                            arrangements between Singapore, Malaysia, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, the entire area is more unstable now than at any time
                            in the past decade. Singapore is more exposed than before to the
                            influence of Peking; Malaysia is less certain of the loyalty of its
                            Borneo components; and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is less
                            convinced of the value of retaining its military commitment in both
                            Singapore and Malaysia. Internally, the communal rivalries which the
                            Malaysian federation was designed to lessen continue unabated and offer
                            encouragement to disruptive forces from both Communist China and
                            Indonesia. Emotional factors, rather than considerations of national
                            self-interest, are likely to play a crucial role in the decisions of
                            leaders <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0640"/>of both Malaysia and
                            Singapore. In these circumstances, the Singapore-Malaysia area is likely
                            to pose greater problems for the US than ever before.</p>

                            circumstances, I am concerned about our lack of direct communication
                            with <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Harry Lee</persName>. Given Lee's
                            attitude toward United States, this breakdown in contact seems to me to
                            be feeding on itself, accentuating <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s isolation and producing inevitably further strains
                            in our relations. I would like to break into this harmful cycle if we
                            can.</p>
                        <p>2. Reestablishing contact is made difficult by <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s belief that US strategic
                            interest in Singapore places him in dominant position and that we can be
                            brought to heel by hardnosed bargaining and threats of Barisan
                            take-over. Our note suggesting raising of Consulate General to Embassy
                            has gone unanswered since mid November.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">The

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> grossly overestimates
                            strength of his bargaining position, and we are prepared to continue
                            with Consulate General status indefinitely rather than accede to
                            Rajaratnam's price of trade concessions for elevation to Embassy status.
                            In seeking reestablished contact therefore, we clearly would wish to
                            avoid encouraging <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s current
                            misconceptions on way to deal with United States. At same time there
                            seems little chance we can place our relationship on more realistic
                            basis until we can deal with him directly.</p>
                        <p>3. I would be most grateful for your suggestions, as senior US official
                            closest to situation with personal experience in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>, on tactics to handle this
                            problem. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s public statements
                            show a realistic appreciation that Singapore's viability and his
                            personal politi- cal <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0641"/>future
                            (separate factors which he naturally considers as identical) depend on
                            trade and economic development which in turn depends in considerable
                            measure on beneficial economic relations with United States. Here
                            obviously is logical basis for a continuing relationship. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s overtures through Australians

                        <p>4. Perhaps best tactic would be to try to get from <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> a resolution of uncertainty
                            surrounding our representation in Singapore. We would prefer raise
                            Consulate General to Embassy, but if Lee wants to continue with
                            Consulate General this would affect our choice of successor for Lacy. In
                            any case we wish to assign senior rep <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with whom <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            could deal. Do you think it would be possible and desirable for you to
                            have informal unpublicized meeting with <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> to convey this message? Would it be more effective
                            to have it passed through <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australian
                            and New Zealand channels? We would prefer to deal with him directly
                            rather than through Commonwealth intermediary. Would appreciate your

                        <p>Around our Chiefs of Mission Conference, I paid visits to Japan
                            (briefly), Viet-Nam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
                            the Republic of China. This memorandum gives the highlights of my <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0642"/>observations, drawing briefly
                            on some of the broader policy points already covered in the “highlights”
                            summary of our Baguio meeting, but primarily on my own observations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. General Observations.</p>
                        <p>a. The atmosphere in the whole area is markedly healthier than last year.
                            This derives primarily from Viet-Nam, with Indonesia a close second in
                            importance. There is an almost universal belief that the US is standing
                            firm for now, and this has been a great strengthener and comfort even to
                            such figures as Lee Kuan Yew. Nonetheless, our Ambassadors stressed that
                            there was still a recurrent fear that we might make some deal and, more
                            basically, that we may not really stay the course. For the time being,
                            this fear is at rest, and the bombing suspension and the Honolulu
                            conference were in the main correctly interpret- ed. Nonetheless, it
                            persists as a major factor to take into account on any actions we may
                            consider that carry the implication of compromise or retreat. In Japan,
                            where the problem is somewhat different and where <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> sees marked favorable trends
                            both on Viet-Nam and on the issue of greater economic responsibility,
                            the bombing suspension and the Honolulu conference had a strongly
                            favorable effect.</p>
                        <p>b. Regional efforts in the area have gained immensely during the past
                            year and need to be pushed further wherever possible. The Asian
                            Development Bank and plans for Southeast Asia have had great impact, and
                            the reopened possibility of <gloss target="#t_ASA1">ASA</gloss>
                            (initially Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines), plus such efforts
                            as the Korean Foreign Ministers Conference, are all moving in the right
                            direction of, a phrase of <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall
                                Green</persName>'s, “putting a rim on the wheel” whose spokes ran
                            only to Washington in the past.</p>
                        <p>c. The heightened tension over Viet-Nam, plus the specific contributions
                            of individual countries, have imposed strains that must be met usually
                            by US contributions. We need added effort, for different reasons, in
                            several countries, and we simply must not let Viet-Nam beggar its
                            neighbors.</p>
                        <p>d. Our overwhelming focus on Viet-Nam has diverted our own policy
                            emphasis slightly from many specific problems now assuming major
                            proportions:</p>
                        <p>—Bringing Japan to a greater role of responsibility, in what <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> describes as a race between
                            such a role and the emergence of a new selfish nationalism;</p>
                        <p>—Meeting the serious strains in Korea, arising from their force
                            contributions and continuing fears and internal problems;</p>
                        <p>—Tension and a tendency to jitters in the Republic of China, especially
                            with the dark cloud of Chinese representation;</p>
                        <p>—Our relationship to the Philippines in a new situation of movement
                            there;</p>
                        <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0643"/>
                        <p>—The needs of Thailand, especially as it becomes a major base area for
                            us;</p>
                        <p>—Whether we should assume a significantly increased role in the Malaysian
                            economic picture and whether we may become involved to some degree,
                            willy-nilly, in the Malaysia/Singapore problem.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow sections 2 on Vietnam and 3 on Thailand.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Singapore.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            </hi>. My talk certainly found him more mellow, and may have opened the
                            way to a more serious and deep relationship than we have ever had. He
                            committed himself to accept an Ambassador, but was evasive on timing. He
                            wants a sophisticated and low-key man, and I think our choice meets this
                            specification.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Trade</hi>. The need for more outlets is real. I
                            tried to hammer home how little we could do in textiles, and to urge a
                            diversified survey both by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                            private consultants. The latter idea seemed to find some response, and
                            we should be prepared to follow up. They are terribly naive on how to
                            deal with the US market.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Relations with Malaysia</hi>. This remains
                            obsessive, and is more than ever the focus of <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s thoughts since his initial
                            pushes to get the British to stay and to establish an Afro-Asian
                            “position” have now been largely satisfied. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> are anathema to <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> (and vice versa), so that I still find it hard to
                            visualize a reconciliation for some time. Nonetheless, the economics
                            alone clearly indicate that the two can neither live with each other nor
                            without.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">British Role</hi>. British influence has markedly
                            declined, and I do not think this was Anthony Head's personality.
                            Rather, it reflects a very deep-seated Malaysian feeling that they want
                            a diversity of friends. We should avoid like the plague getting into any
                            larger defense role, and I did not encounter any urging in Malaysia that
                            we should, although <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has the
                            obsessive fear that the Malaysians now believe we will do this. But
                            while the Malaysians may accept Commonwealth responsibility for their
                            defense, they badly want other evident friends.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Economic Needs</hi>. We must abandon the stereotype
                            of a rich and self-sufficient Malaysia. The Malaysian accounts have
                            changed drastically in the last five years as a result of tin and rubber
                            price changes. Hence, their coming five-year plan calls for more than
                            $300 million of outside credit over this period. This will go in detail
                            to the World Bank Consortium meeting in May, and we already have
                            detailed materials for study. Although I warned them categorically that
                            we would not be ready to announce decisions in May, it is absolutely
                            clear that we face a major decision that will become acute in May. They
                            want us badly, and if their plan makes as much sense as it appeared to
                            me to make, <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0644"/>I would favor a
                            significant contribution. The question of Indonesian reaction has
                            drastically changed from the past, and our participation would give a
                            tremendous boost to the younger and more modern leaders who are evolving
                            a new Malaysia. Needless to say, US stockpile policies that might
                            depress the price of rubber could both cause a present outcry and
                            drastically increased appeals for offsetting US assistance.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Relations with Indonesia</hi>. I found no easy
                            optimism in Malaysia (or anywhere else) that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName> would for a long time call off
                            confrontation or do more than ease the military pressure.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Relations with Singapore</hi>. This is as obsessive
                            a subject as on the Singapore side, but with a clear and growing
                            Malaysian sense that they hold bigger cards in any trade. (I sensed Lee
                            knew this too.) In the difficult personal equations involved, I get the
                            feeling that two Malaysians, Ismail (the number three) and <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> in the Foreign Office could do
                            it. Unfortunately, neither has the political power to be given the
                            chance. The <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> do not trust <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and talk a very different Malay
                            language of personal trust and broad issues, as compared with <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s personal, and perhaps Chinese,
                            more aggressive and precise viewpoint. I see little we or anyone else
                            can do about this, but if our role increases we could at least try to
                            cushion the more outrageous misunderstandings and to bring some
                            appreciation of the overriding common interest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Philippines.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Marcos</hi>. Much more hopeful and potentially
                            decisive than his predecessor, but still only finding his feet. His
                            political debts surround him, and he is far from having an
                            administration “team”. His diffident handling of the recognition of
                            Malaysia reflects these factors, as does his failure to take hold of the
                            economic problem as yet.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Forces for Viet-Nam</hi>. Marcos should get a
                            decisive Senate majority, but at substantial political cost. His Senate
                            problem is enormous. This, plus the over-all uncertain political
                            situation, is the underlying reason for his request for additional
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. To my mind, $4–6 million a year
                            to make his army a real engineer and civic action outfit, with
                            significant political bonuses, is a highly worthwhile investment in
                            every respect.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Economic Issues</hi>. The investment climate is not
                            good, and on the Philippine side there is growing uncertainty as to
                            American agricultural markets. Both problems go together, and we should
                            be working in the next few months to lay out the broad lines on which
                            the Laurel-Langley Agreement will eventually be revised. I doubt if we
                            need to think of any significant additional economic aid. Trade and
                            investment are the keys, and the time has come to start moving.</p>

                        <p>Your talk with Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak is
                            scheduled for 12:30 p.m. tomorrow, Wednesday, October 5. He is the head
                            of Malaysia's delegation to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He is
                            also the heir apparent to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>You may wish:</p>
                        <p>1. To express appreciation for Malaysia's understanding and support of
                            our position in Viet Nam. (Note: Because of their preoccupation with
                            Indonesia, the Malaysians have made only a small contribution
                            themselves—mainly medicine, flood relief, some training for Americans
                            and Vietnamese in jungle fighting);</p>
                        <p>2. Indicate our belief that an Asian initiative on Viet Nam is basically
                            sound and that Malaysia's support for Thanat's peace proposal has added
                            to its acceptability.</p>
                        <p>You are aware that <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> was
                            quoted as saying that Malaysia would send troops to Viet Nam if asked.
                            He claims he was misquoted and said only that he supported the general
                            proposition of foreign assistance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> may raise the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. Military Assistance</p>
                        <p>He will come to the White House directly from a talk with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">

                                on October 5 at the Pentagon. They discussed Asian regional
                                organization, Vietnam, possible helicopter sales to Malaysia,
                                Indonesia, the cultural revolution in China, the future British and
                                Australian role in Malaysia and Singapore, and the future of
                                Southeast Asia. (Washington National Records Center, RG 330, OSD

                        </p>
                        <p>The British are cutting back in their support, and recently turned down a
                            Malaysian request for $110 million of military aid. In 1965 we gave them
                            a $4 million credit on easy terms for military purchases. <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0646"/>Encouraged by that, they may now look
                            to us to fill the hole left by the British.</p>
                        <p>You might state:</p>
                        <p>You realize that he has talked with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and suggest that he follow up
                            on this with Defense and State. Note our heavy commitments, especially
                            Viet Nam. You could point to the intent of Congress to limit <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> recipients to 40; new additions would
                            be difficult. We hope the British will continue as a military supplier
                            and will encourage them in this.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic development.</p>
                        <p>Malaysia launched this year a soundly conceived 5-year development plan.
                            To meet goals, Malaysia will need $630 million in foreign grants and
                            loans. He may ask if we can do more to help.</p>
                        <p>You might state:</p>
                        <p>The U.S. joined with 12 other nations last May to discuss aid to
                            Malaysia. We have offered help through the Ex-Im Bank. Future regional
                            development programs will benefit Malaysia. We have continuing programs
                            under Food for Peace and the Peace Corps. If Malaysia takes full
                            advantage of our offers, total aid over the next 5 years could reach
                            $100 million. We will follow Malaysian economic developments with
                            interest and will be alert for any useful contribution we can make.</p>
                        <p>3. Rubber.</p>
                        <p>World price has been declining steadily. Last month it was the lowest in
                            12 years. Malaysia is deeply concerned; government revenues come mainly
                            from taxes on tin and rubber. They believe sale of our stockpiled rubber
                            is pushing the price down.</p>
                        <p>You might state:</p>
                        <p>We are aware of the problem and are concerned for Malaysia's
                            difficulties. The Department of State and others have the matter under
                            urgent study, and we shall be in touch with the Malaysian government.
                            There are serious budgetary reasons for our disposal policy.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Prime Minister will be accompanied by Malaysian Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_OYLD1">Ong</persName>. Bill Bundy and I will be
                            standing by. I suggest you see Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> alone at first, then call the
                            rest of us in as you see fit. The Ambassador would consider it an honor
                            to be able to meet with you.</p>

                        <p>Malaysia has become something of an economic and political showpiece in
                            Southeast Asia, despite the drag of its troubles with Indonesia. Its
                            leadership is responsible and Western-oriented. With the end of
                            Indonesia's policy of confrontation, Malaysia's outlook is improved.
                            However, it still confronts serious problems in fulfilling its five-year
                            plan. Some arise because of uncertainty over the future of the British
                            military commitments in Singapore and Malaysia upon which Malaysia's
                            security, and the viability of its economic development plans,
                            depend.</p>

                            looks to the United States for sympathy and support: (1) military
                            assistance; (2) support for Malaysia's five-year development plan; and
                            (3) restraint in United States Government rubber and tin stockpile
                            disposal programs.</p>
                        <p>We do not recommend a military assistance program for Malaysia, at this
                            stage. The costs of Viet-Nam are obvious. Our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> resources are limited. We do not wish to precipitate a

                        <p>Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>
                            outlined to you Malaysia's acute anxieties over the decline in rubber
                            prices. He mentioned that United States Government disposals from
                            stockpiles were regarded in Southeast Asia as contributing to a price
                            decline. For a combination of reasons, rubber prices have dropped from
                            26 cents to 22 cents in the period between March and October, 1966. This
                            price drop represents a loss of some $170 million a year of foreign
                            exchange to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. (Malaysia accounts for 40
                            per cent of world production; Indonesia and Thailand together, 40 per
                            cent.) It was appreciated in Kuala Lumpur that the <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss> suspended rubber sales from stockpile
                            following Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>'s conversation with you. The rubber producing
                            countries of Southeast Asia will be extremely sensitive to our disposal
                            policy when sales from stockpile are resumed.</p>
                        <p>In view of our unwillingness to provide military or economic assistance
                            to Malaysia, Bill Gaud and I believe strongly that, prior to your
                            arrival in Kuala Lumpur, the Administration should declare its intention
                            in 1967 to dispose of stockpile rubber at the 1965 level of 120,000
                            tons, rather then the March–October annual level of 170,000 tons, as our
                            contribution to the stabilization of rubber prices at levels which can
                            yield substantial foreign exchange earnings for three critically
                            important Southeast Asian countries—Malaysia, Indonesia and
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the political and economic benefits of this decision to
                            the United States would outweigh the proceeds of selling an additional
                            50,000 tons of rubber, i.e., $25 million.</p>

                        <p>We believe that if this decision were made and made known before your
                            arrival in Kuala Lumpur, the impact would be strongly felt in Malaysia,
                            Indonesia, Thailand, and noticed throughout the entire Far East as a
                            reflection of your concern for the welfare of Asians engaged in
                            production of primary products vulnerable to fluctuations in demand on
                            the part of affluent societies. Rubber generates 17.7 per cent of
                            Malaysia's <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> and 38.6 per cent of its
                            foreign exchange earnings. One quarter of the total Malaysian labor
                            force works on rubber plantations. Rubber trees represent an investment
                            of almost $1 billion, or four times investment in industry.</p>

                            These expectations are inevitable concomitant of widespread Malaysian
                            belief that visit signaled new era of more direct, benevolent U.S.
                            interest in Malaysia.</p>

                            closely preceded President's visit, which Malaysians knew was to be

                            heightened U.S. concern for Malaysia's welfare, President's visit
                            created aura of goodwill unprecedented in nearly ten years of
                            U.S.-Malaysian relations.</p>
                        <p>3. Relations between U.S. and Malaysia have always been friendly—but not
                            intimate. Historically U.S. has regarded external guidance and
                            assistance to Malaysia as primarily responsibility of Commonwealth.
                            Consequently Malaysians felt proud, honored (and somewhat surprised)
                            that President of U.S., country which had not previously paid special
                            attention to Malaysia, included Kuala Lumpur on Far Eastern itinerary
                            which otherwise embraced only U.S. allies. Conclusion reached by most
                            Malaysians (and non-Malaysian diplomatic and journalistic observers
                            also, I believe) was that U.S. now taking Malaysia into its circle of
                            close friends in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore it is not surprising that Malaysia's immediate attention
                            should be directed to prospective tangible benefits to be derived from
                            “new” relationship with U.S. High Malaysian expectations clearly evident
                            from (a) Prime Minister's request to President that he moderate terms of
                            credit for purchase of helicopters and (b) insistent requests from
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> officials for bilateral U.S. aid
                            in private discussions with Black mission. (Newspaper articles and
                            editorials welcomed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> as
                            gift bearer following in President's train.)</p>
                        <p>5. Malaysians also tend now see U.S. assuming more forthright
                            responsibility for ultimate security Malaysia, especially so since
                            President's <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0651"/>visit came at time
                            when <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> constrained reduce commitments
                            this region. King's speech welcoming President called U.S. protector of
                            small nations. Malay language Berita Harian editorial October 31,
                            commenting on President's visit, said “no small nation can continue to
                            exist without protection of big power.” Malaysian conviction along these
                            lines strengthened by (a) thematic emphasis in President's mission to
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> on common interest of U.S. and
                            free nations of region in resisting Communist aggression and building
                            strong, healthy societies, and (b) President's statement in Kuala Lumpur
                            that U.S. prepared assure small nations against ChiCom nuclear
                            blackmail.</p>
                        <p>6. As foregoing paragraphs reveal, in wake of President's visit U.S.
                            finds itself in more direct relationship with Malaysia. I believe this
                            is desirable development and that we should welcome more candid,
                            cooperative basis on which our relations with Malaysia will rest
                            henceforth. Malaysia has vital contribution to make to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> development and cooperation, in which
                            U.S. has vital interest and to support of which U.S. committed.</p>
                        <p>7. Initial tendency of Malaysians to view closer relationship with U.S.
                            largely in terms of supposed opportunity get more U.S. aid presents us
                            with problem in educative diplomacy, but I am hopeful that unrealistic
                            expectations can be brought within reasonable bounds without undue
                            irritation. I believe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName>'s
                            visit was very helpful in this regard. He made clear presentation of
                            limited aid possibilities and set tone for continuing frank dialogue
                            with Malaysians. I believe DepPriMin <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> and other top leaders understand (a) that Malaysia
                            can benefit from indirect U.S. aid through <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> regional programs and must look primarily to that aid
                            channel, and (b) that extensive concessional bilateral assistance from
                            U.S. not in cards unless Malaysian financial situation worsens
                            appreciably. (As noted Kuala Lumpur's 2046,<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Dated November 11. (National Archives and Records Administration,
                                RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 12–5 MALAYSIA)</note> however,

                        <p>As you know, the Malaysians are interested in buying helicopters, and
                            they want to buy them from us. This was the one item of serious business
                            raised with you by the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>
                            during your visit to Kuala Lumpur. You promised to look into the matter

                        </p>
                        <p>The deal would involve 15 helicopters. The Malaysians need them for their
                            civic action and counter-guerrilla activities. The amount of the
                            contract would be about $17.2 million, which would help in our balance
                            of payments problem. The only competitors are an American company
                            (Sikorsky) and a French company.</p>
                        <p>The attached memo from State (Katzenbach),<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">Not printed; dated December 6.</note> in which Defense concurs,
                            recommends that we offer the Malaysians terms of 5 1/2% interest and 7
                            years repayment. It suggests that we inform the Malaysians in a letter
                            to Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName>
                            from Bill Bundy, and that you not communicate directly with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> on this matter.</p>
                        <p>I find the memorandum from State inadequate on several grounds.</p>
                        <p>First, it does not offer you the options that in fact exist for handling
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>Second, it is misleading in implying (paragraph c, page 2) that it would
                            require $11 million to cover the difference between an offer of 5 1/2%
                            and 3% on interest rates.</p>
                        <p>Third, it does not offer a judgement as to how the Malaysians may react
                            except to say “we may have some protest and bad feeling.”</p>
                        <p>Fourth, it does not offer a judgement on the likelihood of the Malaysians
                            turning to the French for this contract if we offer the suggested
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>I have asked Bill Jorden to staff this out further. He has done so, with
                            State, Defense and the Bureau of the Budget.</p>

                            credit would cost out as follows (all figures approximate):</p>

                        <p>Funding for your preferred option can come from:</p>
                        <p>(1) Adjustments in the credit sales program (assuming not all of the
                            programmed sales materialize);</p>
                        <p>(2) selling at harder terms to some countries for which concessional
                            terms are now planned;</p>
                        <p>(3) the contingency reserve (which at last report was about $18
                            million).</p>
                        <p>On Malaysian reaction:</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>'s reporting that the offer proposed by State and
                            Defense will come as a severe disappointment to the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and to his government. It may be
                            “without any warrant from us”—as State says—that the Malaysians have
                            built up their hopes for something better than 5 1/2%. But the fact is
                            that those hopes exist.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago, we offered these same terms on Cessna aircraft. We lost
                            out to the Canadians—and there were demonstrations in the street
                            denouncing the U.S. as “uncle skinflint.”</p>
                        <p>The Malaysians have come along well in backing our policy on Viet-Nam.
                            They seem ready to do somewhat better in the future. I would not like to
                            see that trend reversed without good cause.</p>
                        <p>Nor would I like to see the very positive effects of your visit to <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss> dissipated needlessly.</p>
                        <p>On probable outcome:</p>
                        <p>The Malaysians prefer our helicopters. But the French apparently have
                            offered 3% for 10 years. Sikorsky representative thinks the Malaysians
                            will go to the French if we offer 5 1/2% for 7 years. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> agrees.</p>
                        <p>On the problem of precedent:</p>
                        <p>State and Defense are concerned that a better offer than that proposed
                            will encourage other military purchasers to expect concessional terms.
                            They are also worried that the Malaysians would expect us to <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0654"/>supplant the British military role
                            which, as the memo states, “is the last thing we wish to do.”</p>
                        <p>I am sympathetic with both these concerns. However, we have made
                            concessional sales in the past, in a variety of countries, without those
                            concessions automatically becoming the basis for future deals. We have,
                            in fact, made military sales to the Malaysians themselves (in 1965) at
                            3% for 10 years. I see no reason why our position cannot be explained to
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and to others (if the
                            question arises). This is one of the functions of diplomats—to make
                            complicated and sensitive matters clear to others. I would explain it as
                            a very extraordinary case holding no promises for the future, and as
                            your response to a quite special appeal from the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you consider favorably an offer of 4% for 7 years, with
                            a 10% down payment. Our best estimate is that we can get the deal on
                            these terms, although they are not as good as the French. But, in any
                            case, you would have clearly responded to the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s appeal. You may want to tell
                            State and Defense that this is your inclination but that you will
                            consider any strong and overriding objections. Unless there are such
                            major objections, you propose to move ahead on this line.</p>

                        <p>The President has considered carefully your memorandum of December 6
                            (copy attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">See <ref target="#d277fn3">footnote 3, Document 277</ref>.</note> on the above subject. He
                            has weighed and is sympathetic to the arguments therein regarding an
                            offer of support for the purchase at 5–1/2 per cent interest and 7 years
                            repayment.</p>
                        <p>However, he recalls that this matter was the one item of serious business
                            raised with him by the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> on
                            his recent visit to Malaysia. He attaches importance to the friendship
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and to the good
                            relations that have developed between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Given the importance of Malaysia's role in Southeast Asia, its internal
                            situation, and its sympathetic understanding of our policy in Viet-Nam,
                            the President believes that a somewhat more concessional offer is in
                            order on a “one shot” basis. The sale will, of course, benefit our
                            balance of payments. He has approved our support for an offer of 4 per
                            cent for 7 years.</p>
                        <p>He believes that it is possible to make such an offer and at the same
                            time make clear to the Malaysians that it is not a precedent, that it is
                            made at considerable sacrifice on our part, and that it will not provide
                            the basis for any future sales. The Malaysians should be reminded of our
                            severe and burdensome obligations elsewhere in Asia.</p>
                        <p>As to financing, possibilities within the present <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program should be explored first. Defense might want to
                            consider hardening somewhat the concessional terms for other sales.
                            Drawing on the contingency reserve for credit sales is another
                            possibility.</p>
                        <p>The special circumstances of the President's trip to Malaysia and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>'s personal appeal could
                            be considered as putting this matter in the “contingency” category.</p>
                        <p>If there are major considerations not heretofore brought to the
                            President's attention, he has expressed his willingness to take them
                            under advisement. In the absence of such overriding considerations, <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0656"/>he has approved moving ahead
                            along the lines noted in the third paragraph of this memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">On December 27 <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> cabled the President the following: “Your

                        <p>In mid-October Lee Kuan Yew will make his first visit to the United
                            States as Prime Minister of independent Singapore.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">His only previous visit was in July 1962 when he
                                made a brief stop in San Francisco and attended a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting in New York. [Footnote in the

                            Singapore's future economic stability and security. While he is anxious
                            to maintain Singapore's non-aligned foreign policy and can portray this
                            visit as balanced by his own 1966 trip to Eastern Europe and that of his
                            deputy to Moscow in 1965, he will nevertheless hope that his visit will
                            eventually pay off in concrete benefits for Singapore.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s Attitude Towards the US;
                            Aloof but Friendly. In the first days of Singapore's independence, Lee
                            Kuan Yew, who had a reputation for <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0657"/>being pro-British but unfamiliar and somewhat
                            contemptuous of Americans, was acidly critical of the United States to
                            the press, revealing in the process a 1961 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> effort to penetrate the Singapore police. This public,
                            bitter anti-American phase (to which family problems then probably
                            contributed) was shortlived. Before the end of 1965, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and his principal cabinet advisers
                            were convinced that, for economic survival, an independent Singapore
                            must expand its exports to the United States and attract American
                            capital to develop new export industries.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> also recognized the
                            importance to Singapore's stability of the American effort to forestall
                            Communist aggression. In private talks with important American visitors,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has supported the US
                            position in Vietnam,<note n="4" xml:id="d279fn4">On June 29 John P.

                                which the Prime Minister said he supported American intervention in
                                Vietnam and feared that, if it failed, Communist subversion would
                                slowly spread through all of Southeast Asia. There is no indication
                                on the retyped copy that the President saw it. (Ibid.)</note>
                            although not all our tactics, particularly the bombing of North Vietnam;
                            in public, he has said that the fate of Asia for years to come will be
                            decided by what happens in South Vietnam and that holding the line in
                            South Vietnam against Communist expansion is essential to Singapore's
                            stability. In addition to recognizing the strategic importance of the US
                            role in Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and his
                            government appreciate the economic benefits accruing from purchases in
                            Singapore for US forces in South Vietnam and from Rest and Recreation
                            expenditures there.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has also been led to
                            reassess his attitude towards an American security role in the area by
                            his gradual acceptance of the fact that the British are going to
                            withdraw militarily from the Malaysia-Singapore area by the mid-1970's
                            except possibly for small forces to fulfill the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> commitment under the mutual defense treaty. He has
                            suggested publicly that, under certain circumstances, an American
                            military presence might become necessary.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s Principal Objectives.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> probably does not expect
                            to obtain specific commitments from the United States during the course
                            of his visit. Rather he probably hopes to establish a climate in which
                            he can obtain sympathetic understanding of Singapore's problems and of
                            his own views as to how the United States can contribute to their
                            amelioration. Defense arrangements, economic problems, and Singapore's
                            role in the area will probably be foremost among his preoccupations.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> may raise the question of US
                            willingness to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in
                            guaranteeing the external defense of the area. In the light of
                            Malaysia's and Indonesia's interest in diverting their trade away from
                            Singapore and the economic effects of the British military withdrawal,
                            he may hint that the US should make especially favorable conditions for
                            Singapore exports. He may suggest that the US contract with Singapore to
                            have some of its ship repair work done in Singapore. He will want to
                            convince us that Singapore's population is primarily oriented to
                            Singapore not China, and he will assure us that Singapore is willing to
                            bear its share of responsibility for effective regional cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Possible Results of <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s Visit:
                            A Good Public Image in the US but Friction in Southeast Asia. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> visit will probably
                            command considerable American press attention. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s already scheduled public
                            appearances at the National Press Club in Washington and the Council on
                            Foreign Relations in New York may well be supplemented by others and by
                            TV and radio interviews. All of this will be gratifying to <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and may well increase the sympathy
                            and respect with which he is now inclined to view the United States. On
                            the other hand, to the extent that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is widely publicized by the American press and built
                            up as an Asian intellectual leader, his visit may antagonize the
                            Malaysian government, particularly Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName> and Finance Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan Siew Sin</persName>, who have not
                            themselves attracted wide publicity in the US. While <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s American visit may enhance his
                            prestige as an Asian leader and Singapore's status among other Southeast
                            Asian countries, too much and too favorable publicity for <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>, an ethnic Chinese, could also be
                            resented by non-Chinese leaders of other neighboring states who also
                            crave the limelight as Asian leaders. This possibility, together with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s disinclination to take

                            <item>Malaysian Desire to See You on Fall in Rubber Prices</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The price of rubber has recently reached a 17-year low. The Government of
                            Malaysia is trying to give the impression that it is doing something
                            about it. Without any discussion with us, they announced that their
                            Finance Minister was coming to Washington to discuss with you, if
                            possible, the “serious problem” posed by sales from our rubber
                            stockpile.</p>
                        <p>This is nonsense. During the past 12 months we have cut our stockpile
                            sales from 170,000 tons a year to the current 70,000 tons, all of which
                            is used to meet U.S. Government contracts. These sales simply are not a
                            significant factor in the current rubber market.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe you should see the Malaysian Finance Minister:</p>
                        <p>(1) He will be asking that we totally suspend our disposal sales. He
                            should be told “no,” and I think it best that he get that answer from a
                            lower level.</p>
                        <p>(2) It is probable that the Malaysians will, at some stage, try to make
                            us the whipping boy for their rubber problems. I, therefore, think it
                            best that you avoid any personal involvement in this matter.</p>
                        <p>(3) Finally, they are trying to meet a serious problem by chanting magic
                            incantations. I think it is beneath the dignity of your office to get
                            involved in this exercise in futility.</p>
                        <p>The State Department is in agreement, but I expect Malaysian Ambassador
                            Ong will make strenuous efforts to arrange the appointment through the
                            back door, once he finds the front door is locked. This memorandum is
                            intended to “cut him off at the gulch.”</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you decline all efforts to arrange a meeting between you
                            and the Malaysian Finance Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">Johnson
                                checked the “Approve” option. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> added the following handwritten option: “My
                                boys recommend that I see him.” <persName>Johnson</persName>
                                subsequently changed his mind and did see the Finance Minister; see

                                        <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> was planning to
                                    follow his meeting with the President with a speech in New York
                                    in which he would call for complete suspension of our sales from
                                    the rubber stockpile. It [an attached cable from Kuala Lumpur]
                                    also shows that exposure to reality in Ernie's office has led
                                    the Malaysian Government to order the suspension of <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> statements attributing the

                                    connecting the President with the rubber problem and the need
                                    for “courteous but complete candor” with the Malaysians. (Ibid.,

                        <p>I thought it might be useful for you to have this background prior to the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Malaysians are continuing their all-out efforts to get Finance
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan Siew Sin</persName> in to the
                            President. They have sent Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> here as an advance man charged
                            with the task of getting the appointment.</p>
                        <p>In meetings at State and here, <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> has made a very vigorous presentation, the
                            essence of which is:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Malaysians greatly value their friendship with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Malaysian future is based on the success of current development
                            efforts largely based upon stability in the rubber market.</p>
                        <p>(3) The decline in the rubber market is an extremely serious problem for
                            Malaysia, and Communist propagandists are attempting to poison
                            U.S./Malaysian relations by using our stockpile disposals as “evidence”
                            that the U.S. is not really helpful to Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>(4) The Malaysian government wants to remove, once and for all, this
                            irritant in U.S./Malaysian relations.</p>
                        <p>(5) The Malaysians, therefore, want to discuss a series of proposals for
                            ending the stockpile problem.</p>
                        <p>(6) In the meantime, it is essential that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> see President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and that the President indicate that he has
                            instructed his government to work “together” with Malaysia in regard to
                            the rubber problem.</p>
                        <p>(7) This will then enable the Malaysian authorities to handle their
                            public relations problems with Communist agitators.</p>
                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GDM1">Ghazali</persName> stresses that, for the
                            time being, concrete steps are not as important as the atmospherics of a
                            presidential meeting.</p>
                        <p>Of the various Malaysian proposals for dealing with the stockpile, only
                            one has any possible merit from the U.S. point of view—that the
                            Malaysians purchase the entire stockpile. We have had several meetings
                            with the technicians on this possibility, and Ed Fried has come up with
                            a package which all agree is worth considering from our point of view.
                            Briefly, the package is:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Malaysians would convert $100–$150 million of their reserves into
                            5-year Treasury bonds. Thus we get an immediate balance-of-payment
                            effect to the value of the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>(2) EXIM extends a credit to the Malaysians to enable them to purchase
                            the stockpile. This is a washout from the budgetary point of view in
                            that it is a debit to EXIM and a credit to the stockpile account. The
                            loan agreement would provide for repayment within three years. Thus, we
                            would get a net favorable budget effect, either immediately by selling
                            the paper at a discount, gradually through the amortization of the loan
                            or, at worst, in lump-sum repayment after three years.</p>
                        <p>We do not know whether this idea is even in the ball park, so far as the
                            Malaysians are concerned. Bob Barnett is informally sounding out the
                            Malaysians on this. Thus far, all agree that if the Malaysians are not
                            serious about a previous agreement on something concrete, <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> should not see the President.
                            State, however, is giving at the seams and will, I think, eventually
                            recommend the meeting, even if it is only for cosmetic effect.</p>
                        <p>My own instinct is that the Malaysians are really engaged only in an
                            effort to get <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> in to see the
                            President. I believe they will take the position that nothing concrete
                            can be agreed upon without extensive study, but their hearts are in the
                            right place, and we should show that our hearts are in the right place
                            by having the President receive <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> and make noises on working together on the rubber
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>An additional complication, of which you should be aware, is that the
                            Indonesian Finance Minister, Franz Seda, will be in town at the same
                            time (next week) as <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName>. Seda
                            also wishes to see the President to deliver a letter from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suharto1">Suharto</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">Seda met with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>; see <ref target="#d245fn2">footnote 2, Document 245</ref>.</note> State
                            is much concerned with the damage that could be done if Seda were to see
                            the President while <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> was
                            refused. I agree that this is a problem. One way out would be for you to
                            see Seda on the President's behalf.</p>

                        <p>The Malaysian Minister of Finance has been in Washington for ten days as
                            a Special Emissary of the Malaysian Prime Minister, to explore with us
                            ways of alleviating the situation in rubber whose price has fallen to an
                            eighteen year low. He has asked us in the strongest terms for at least a
                            courtesy appointment with you. Our recommendation is that you agree to
                            such an appointment on Tuesday, October 10, or Wednesday, October 11,

                            would make no requests of you with respect to rubber, would make

                        <p>The Malaysian Minister of Finance left Kuala Lumpur with the Malaysian
                            press stating that his purpose was to request you to suspend sales from
                            the <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss> stockpile. For a considerable
                            period of time, Malaysia has attributed an entirely disproportionate
                            importance to stockpile disposals as a factor in the downward trend of
                            rubber prices which currently are at their lowest level in 18 years.
                            They have taken hitherto no account of the difficulties you would face
                            in reducing disposals below the present level of 70,000 tons being sold
                            exclusively for U.S. <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0663"/>Government
                            purposes. We have said in the strongest terms that reduction below
                            70,000 would be impossible. The Finance Minister brought with him to
                            Washington a proposal to purchase the whole of the 360,000 tons of
                            stockpile rubber. Under what precise arrangements such a transaction may
                            be possibly completed without adverse effect upon either the U.S. or
                            Malaysian budget and balance of payments situations has been under
                            urgent study for the past week. After very careful calculations, it was
                            the opinion of both sides that the gap between the price Malaysia was
                            prepared to offer and that which <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss>
                            could accept was too wide to offer any promise that a transaction could
                            be closed without some other, perhaps radically different, approach to
                            the possibility of a sale. Discussion of possibilities can be resumed if
                            the Malaysians desire.</p>
                        <p>We have been impressed by the way Minister <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> and his colleagues have begun to search for
                            realistic solutions to the problems of natural rubber and are gratified
                            that they seem ready to try to deflect Malaysian public opinion from a
                            long-standing preoccupation with our stockpile sales. He has accepted,
                            with disappointment but in seeming good spirit, our judgment that an
                            international rubber agreement, dealing with synthetic and natural
                            rubber, is impractical and that the United States could give no
                            encouragement to holding conferences or commencing discussions for the
                            purpose of establishing such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> faces real problems
                            in returning to Malaysia if he can offer no credible explanation for why
                            he remained ten days in Washington as Special Emissary of the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and failed to see you. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan</persName> is prepared to make firm
                            commitments that in a call on you he would ask nothing of you nor raise
                            any points brought up in our recent discussions on rubber. Instead he
                            would be prepared to express appreciation for reductions you have made
                            in rubber stockpile disposals, and would wish otherwise to use the
                            occasion of his call to discuss Southeast Asian regional cooperation
                            and, in particular, the important role of the Asian Development
                            Bank.</p>

                        <p>The Minister conveyed greetings from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku Abdul Rahman</persName> and referred to the
                            warmth and joy of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s visit to Malaysia. He said he had come to
                            Washington because of difficult circumstances which had arisen in
                            Malaysia because of the price of rubber. He explained the economy was
                            heavily dependent on rubber and the price was the lowest in 18 years,
                            causing budgetary and balance of payments problems. To illustrate, he
                            said that rubber smallholders are—reminiscent of days of the Japanese
                            Occupation—now getting only one meal a day. In short, rubber prices were
                            having grave social and economic effects.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said although he did not want to burden the President with
                            details, he did want to explain that Malaysia had brought to Washington
                            three proposals. One was to buy up the rubber stockpile and here he said
                            the United States and Malaysia had found a wide area of agreement, but
                            none yet on the critical question of price. His second proposal was for
                            Malaysia to have first refusal to buy the 17,500 tons we are now
                            offering quarterly. This was not acceptable to the United States. The
                            third was an offer to buy on the open market, the foreign exchange costs
                            of which could be covered by a switch in Malaysian reserves from London.
                            The present situation was a decision to continue the dialogue and not to
                            close the door on further exploration of possibilities. He said he
                            thought this was a useful step toward solving the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0665"/>
                        <p>The President asked how much surplus we had and how Malaysia would pay
                            for it. It was explained that there was a 360,000 ton surplus and that
                            it could be paid for through a financing arrangement with the
                            Export-Import Bank. The President asked whether or not there would be a
                            loss or a gain in the sale of rubber. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW4">Barnett</persName> explained how discount of the price from the
                            current 19.5 to 13.5 might be possible. The Malaysians still said they
                            could only pay 6 less than this. The calculations that went into our
                            reduction from 19.5 to 13.5 represented savings to <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss> by selling rather than storing,
                            administering, and processing this deteriorating commodity. The
                            Malaysians took into consideration in arriving at an offer of 7 a pound
                            such additional factors as a discount for bulk sales, projection of
                            declining price, and a certain “aid” factor. The President agreed
                            immediately that we should not make such discounts. He would be obliged
                            one day to justify sale to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tan Siew Sin</persName> explained
                            decline in value of our stockpile. We had bought when prices were very
                            high during the Korean War. The current soft market price of rubber was
                            due to an economic recession in Western Europe (he also included the
                            USA), more Indonesian rubber in the market, closure of the Suez, and
                            strikes in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said why didn't we use rubber in tires purchased by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said that we were using the rubber
                            for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> purposes.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that he was faced with $30 billion deficit due to
                            costs for the war in Viet-Nam. He said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had estimated a revenue of $800 million from disposals
                            on surplus commodities, but that in fact this was running at a rate of
                            only $400 million. He asked Mr. Califano to take another look at how
                            sales of stockpile items could be increased.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what Malaysia was doing to help in the Viet-Nam War,
                            especially in regard to training, which he recalled he had discussed
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> last October. The
                            President said he had to show some more aid from Malaysia and from other
                            countries in the area whose interests and safety we defended. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> explained that Malaysia
                            was training 35–40 police officials at any given time. The President
                            thought this was pretty small and expressed the hope that many more
                            Vietnamese would be sent to Malaysia for broader training. We should
                            step up this program.<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">In a memorandum to

                                shoulder from the Vietnamese.” <persName corresp="#p_WWM1">Wright</persName> suggested that the Malaysians' best
                                contribution was training high-level officials in implementation of
                                economic development plans and getting political credit from it.

                            to the Asian Development Bank. The President expressed some doubt that
                            he would be able to get the needed legislation from Congress this

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s visit is in many
                            ways similar in tone and objectives to that of Ne Win a year ago.
                            Although <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has come out
                            strongly in basic defense of our actions in Viet-Nam, and is deeply
                            engaged in Southeast Asian regional cooperation, he remains basically
                            independent and non-aligned. What he really wants to do is to discuss
                            the future of Southeast Asia frankly with you and to assess American
                            policy there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is a highly intelligent and
                            able man, educated in the law in England, and deeply familiar with the
                            British and particularly the current Labour Government. He now realizes
                            that the British are in the process of disengaging from Southeast Asia,
                            and this leads him to two related beliefs: (a) that a continuing
                            American role in Viet-Nam and in support of individual and regional
                            economic development is vitally important; but (b) at the same time,
                            that the nations of the area must use the time we have bought for them
                            in Viet-Nam (his own phrase) to strengthen themselves and to cooperate
                            much more strongly. What he wants to know, not only from talking with
                            you but from a wide schedule of contacts in the rest of his trip, is
                            whether the United States has the stamina to see Viet-Nam through, and
                            the subtlety and will to play the important but over time diminishing
                            role that he envisages for us in the area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is Singapore, and would
                            probably appreciate it particularly if your conversation with him was
                            largely private and without staff. He may be tense at first in a new
                            setting, but we believe you will find him direct, frank, <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0668"/>and very much worth talking to. He has
                            no significant requests to make, and no desire whatever even to mention
                            the frictions we had with him two years ago [1 line of source text not
                            declassified]. For him, the past is dead, and the important thing is to
                            plot his future in a new type of Southeast Asia, with an American role
                            along lines very similar to those we ourselves would visualize.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to get a capsule picture of his thoughts and intentions, we
                            enclose major excerpts from a television interview that he gave in late
                                September.<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">Attached but not

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has no doubt of the basic
                            importance of our seeing it through. He has made a number of strong and
                            helpful statements in the past nine months, the latest being at the
                            British Labour Party conference in Scarborough. He does not expect to be
                            thanked for these, but a quiet expression of appreciation for his
                            understanding would not be amiss.</p>
                        <p>You might consider asking him what he would do at this point in your
                            shoes. He has no very special knowledge of Hanoi, but he does know
                            Communists from long experience, and he considers himself something of
                            an expert on China. His response could be interesting and would probably
                            be along the lines of a middle course—doing all we can in the South,
                            keeping up the pressure and the bombing unless we get something very
                            concrete in return for stopping, but not appearing to threaten China or
                            the existence of North Viet-Nam. Although <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has signed on to one “stop the bombing” communiqué
                            with the Indians, it seems pretty clear that—like the Indonesians—he did
                            so for the sake of his non-aligned image and not out of deep belief. He
                            would be deeply interested if you gave him your personal views on the
                            strength of dissent and opposition in this country, and how you are
                            handling the situation. He and the inner circle of his government are
                            highly discreet, and we have no reason to believe that any confidence
                            you share with him would be violated.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s conversion to this was due
                            much to the highly successful visit of Eugene Black during his trip last
                            fall. He became convinced that our quiet general support made sense, and
                            he then went to work with the other nations to form what is now the
                                <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> grouping of Malaysia,
                            Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> would have liked to see <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> bite off more concrete economic
                            projects, but he accepts it as a good first step. You might wish to draw
                            him out on this, <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0669"/>not only on
                            the economic possibilities but on whether he sees <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> making an indirect security
                            contribution over time. We ourselves believe that <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> could reduce the chances of further
                            difficulty between Indonesia and its neighbors, and that—even though it
                            has no express security provisions—it could develop a useful morale and
                            authenticating function against future aggression directed at any of its
                            members or countries in the area.</p>

                        <p>Singapore's economy could be enormously benefited by the revival of
                            Indonesia, and <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is totally in
                            favor of our policy of multilateral aid. He is not all that sure that
                            Indonesia can maintain its stability, but he has no doubt that this is
                            essential in the future picture of the area.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and the <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> are oil and water, and there are
                            continuing suspicions and criticisms. Basically, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is a bright Chinese who thinks
                            that Malays are pretty sloppy people. Occasionally, he gets into
                            destructive and unhelpful comment on this, although we doubt very much
                            that he would do so with you. Nonetheless, he knows that the two have to
                            get along, and will not demur to being told so in quiet but firm tones,
                            as we are making clear that this is something the two have to handle for
                            themselves. In the past, he has been concerned that we were going to
                            step into the British shoes in Malaysia and give Malaysia extensive
                            military support; this fear has now been allayed by our low-key policy
                            in Malaysia and by our willingness to sell modest military equipment to
                            Singapore itself.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> fought last spring's fight
                            with the British, shoulder to shoulder with us, the Australians, and the
                            New Zealanders, and may well have been the most effective of any of us.
                            He is deeply concerned that the British at least adhere to their present
                            timetable, and he will be joining with the Malaysians, Australians, New
                            Zealanders, and hopefully the British to review the situation in early
                            1968 and see what can be done. His comments on the current British
                            situation would be worth hearing, as he has just come from England. His
                            comments on the future will probably be general, except for point 6

                            We suggest you tell him simply that we have had a hard look at this, and
                            that he should discuss it <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0670"/>with

                                They discussed prospects of continued British military use of

                                repair and maintenance facilities and its military airfield would
                                keep the British Navy there. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> hoped that the United States would also consider
                                using Singapore, and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed to look into that possibility.

                                discussion on Vietnam in which <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> argued that the United States was placing

                            anything on this score with you. We have a reasonably satisfactory
                            cotton textile agreement, and his main concern is to get more American

                            situation, on which certain minor matters are pending, we suggest you

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is deeply convinced that the
                            future of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia lies in their
                            individual countries, and that Singapore can serve as an independent
                            model and influence in the area. At one time, he had the suspicion that
                            Americans were convinced that the overseas Chinese were a Chinese
                            Communist fifth column. If he gets on to this topic, you should leave
                            him in no doubt we have no such belief today, and that we fully share
                            his basic view.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and his government have done
                            an outstanding job of making Singapore work. The living standard is the
                            second highest in Asia, and his housing and other programs are models.
                            So are his civil service and lack of corruption. At the moment, his
                            political troubles seem minimal, with the more chauvinist Chinese put at
                            a disadvantage by the disorder on the mainland.</p>
                        <p>He would doubtless appreciate your expressing a word of congratulations
                            on his domestic performance and asking for his comment.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is as uncertain as the rest
                            of us of what is going to develop there, but probably sees it as a
                            gradual unraveling unless Mao calls off the cultural revolution. His
                            main concern is that when Communist China pulls itself together—2, 5, or
                            10 years from now—Southeast Asia should have been strengthened to the
                            point where the Chinese will let it alone. He is entirely clear that the
                            Communist Chinese do not plan <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0671"/>military aggression, but equally clear that they will inevitably exert
                            great pressure and build up subversive assets if Communist China is
                            again united and determined and Southeast Asia has not become a lot
                            stronger and more cooperative.</p>

                        <p>We have drafted a very simple joint statement to be issued on the
                            afternoon of the second day of the visit.<note n="4" xml:id="d284fn4">The joint statement, October 18, is printed in American Foreign
                                Policy: Current Documents, 1967, pp. 806–807.</note> We expect to
                            have this worked out fully before <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> arrives, and at the latest on the first afternoon.
                            In Washington, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is not
                            appearing in public, but is making an off-the-record speech to the
                            Overseas Writers and seeing the House and Senate committees. Thus, there
                            should be no real competing publicity during his Washington stay, unless
                            the Congressional committees should leak.</p>
                        <p>On the rest of his trip, he has several public speeches and will appear
                            on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, October 22. He knows how to handle
                            himself, and we think the net results could be very favorable. You might
                            wish to indicate your awareness that he is doing these public
                            appearances, but we strongly urge that you give him no substantive
                            advice unless he asks for it—and then only in low key. He is an
                            articulate and tough politician who will have already figured out what
                            he wants to say.</p>

                        <p>1. In response to the Secretary's opening question about what he thought
                            British intentions in Singapore were, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> said that barring catastrophe to the British pound,
                            the British position would hold until April 1971. They would, however,
                            be gone from Malaysia, and the die would be cast for their eventual
                            complete withdrawal from the ground in Southeast Asia. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> indicated that he gave little
                            credence to the British defense commitment once that withdrawal took
                            place. The danger would be internal, not external, and there was little
                            that a mobile force, afloat or in the air, could do to help on that. It
                            was important that someone fill the vacuum. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> said he was disturbed at the prospect of New
                            Zealand's expected movement of troops out of Malaysia to Viet-Nam. The
                            Communists along the Malaysia-Thai border would be watching these
                            developments carefully. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> said
                            it had been the British and Australians who had convinced the Communists
                            they couldn't win the insurgency in Malaya. They might, in the absence
                            of replacement for the British troops withdrawn, be emboldened to try
                            again.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> what
                            he would do if he were in our shoes in Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> said he would put the alternatives
                            before his political opponents and make them choose. He thought a
                            bombing pause might be tried but there was danger if it failed, that the
                            hands of those political opponents who favored escalation would be
                            strengthened. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> thought the
                            most important thing to do was to find “digits” strong enough to put
                            backbone into the South Vietnamese and to provide the government there
                            with the required credibility. He spoke critically of General Thieu and
                            Marshal Ky and he questioned whether the United States would continue to
                            show the necessary stamina in the face of the lack of productivity of
                            the war effort under their leadership.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> also deprecated the U.S.
                            record in Asia. As examples, he cited our alleged failure to come to the
                            aid of the Kuomintang Government in China (giving our support, instead,
                            to Europe in the form of the <persName>Marshall</persName> Plan) and
                            other (unspecified) actions in the 1950's which he called
                            “imperialistic, selfish and cynical.” He said he would not commit
                            himself to the side of the United States unless and until he could be
                            assured that we would stand firm in Asia and that we would stand back of
                            him. He implied that this would require proof on our part erasing his
                            doubts. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> went into some
                            diatribe alleging that the <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0673"/>American motives, leading it to favor its European at the expense of
                            its Asian commitments were basically attributable to racial feelings
                            against Asians. The Secretary said he could not accept that
                            interpretation of our record in Asia or our motivations. He added that
                            unless the Prime Minister could find the assurances he was seeking of
                            the kind of people we are from our record in Asia since World War II,
                            there was no form of words that would provide such assurance.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> talked at length about his
                            suspicions that American “Eurocentrism” made it unlikely that we would
                            do what will be necessary to preserve a balance of power in favor of the
                            free countries of Asia. He seemed to be trying to draw the Secretary
                            into a statement about the willingness of the United States to make a
                            commitment to Singapore as a quid pro quo for more explicit support of
                            the U.S. position in Asia by Singapore. Toward the end of the meeting,
                            the Prime Minister's voice took on an urgent, almost desperate note as
                            he pictured the United States and Singapore in partnership in Southeast
                            Asia. The Secretary, however, made no commitment.<note n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">In a November 15 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> stated that for reasons not clear to him,

                                argument was urgent, almost desperate, which he attributed to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s tension about his
                                first meeting with <persName>Johnson</persName>, the long day, and

                                maintain a British military presence in Singapore and his hope the

                                remained suspicious of “the Generals” in Indonesia and “the young

                                stated he wanted to arm Singapore sufficiently to “give anybody a

                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> promised the sale to Singapore of

                            <item>Wednesday, October 18, 1967</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Yesterday morning in a frank exchange with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of
                            Singapore, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> likened our
                            experience in Vietnam to a long bus ride, from which we had several
                            opportunities to get off, but from which we cannot now debark until the
                            trip is successfully concluded. We could have left the scene in 1956
                            after the elections of that year; in 1961 because of the generally
                            unfavorable situation; and in 1963 after Diem's death, by stating that
                            we did not desire to get mixed up with the “generals' settlement” and
                            therefore withdraw our 25,000 advisers. By 1965, there was no longer a
                            choice, and in 1967 any talk of withdrawal is nonsensical.</p>
                        <p>“What will happen to you,” he declared. “Who will place any confidence in
                            you?”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the United States had made no commitment to
                            him, and that he was not looking for one. He said, however, that if the
                            United States indulged in a “give-away” or withdrew from Vietnam, there
                            would be fighting in Thailand within one and a half to two years, in
                            Malaysia shortly thereafter, and within three years, “I would be hanging
                            in the public square.”</p>
                        <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0675"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> stated that he had rejected
                            Communism and defeated it in his country by “ballots and not bullets.”
                            “My God,” he said, “they want to punish me for that!”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, who was to speak before the National Press Club at
                            noon and before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee later in the
                            afternoon, asserted that he could not understand either our Senators or
                            our Press. He asked if the Senators spoke from their hearts or for their
                            constituents, when they declared we should get out of Vietnam. He said
                            the Press was making Vietnam a domestic political issue, and he is
                            reluctant to get involved in the domestic debate on Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I explained to him the relative political independence of a U.S. Senator
                            and told him that in my opinion, if the chips were really down, that 80
                            out of 100 Senators would support our policies in Vietnam. I also
                            assured him that the Press would report what he said as he said it.</p>
                        <p>I urged him to tell the Senate, the Press Club and his viewers and
                            listeners on his “Meet the Press” appearance, exactly what he had said
                            to me.</p>
                        <p>Without urging or prompting, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            summed up his feelings:</p>
                        <p>“Does America feel that we are human beings? That this part of the world
                            matters? The center of gravity has moved from the Mediterranean to the
                            Atlantic to the Pacific. You are going to have to take sides. No one
                            wants to be on the losing side. With you, we have a fighting chance. For
                            me, it's survival.”</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> stated that we must convince them
                            that history is not on their side. If they believe this, they will not
                            hold out for a long period of time. Referring again to the necessity for
                            perseverance on the part of the United States in Asia, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> stated: “If you are wavering, I am
                            going to make some contingency plans.” He added that the Thais, who have
                            a legendary reputation in Asia for anticipating history and switching
                            sides to end up on the winning side, will be the first to make other
                            arrangements and reach some accommodation with North Vietnam or
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that U.S. presence in Asia is essential to his own survival,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is nevertheless
                            concerned about how one can keep the temperature controlled in the
                            United States on this issue during an election year. He is greatly
                            concerned that the war might widen. Speaking of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, whom he had met and whom he
                            greatly admires, he stated that “when I have seen him (<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>) whittled down by the
                            generals, this worries me.”</p>
                        <p>I assured the Prime Minister that the main general, the
                            Commander-in-Chief, is elected, and he is the man in charge. There is a
                            strong tradition here of civilian supremacy, which once led President
                            Truman to remove General MacArthur at the time of the Korean War. <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0676"/>This government is not engaged
                            in trying to obliterate North Vietnam. The President remains open to
                            suggestion and innovations on the question of strategy and tactics. He
                            is determined that every possible restraint will be applied to prevent
                            the war from becoming a major conflagration. He has emphasized this in
                            his talks with foreign leaders, including those with Prime Minister
                            Kosygin at Glassboro.</p>
                        <p>I told the Prime Minister that there is general agreement here on the
                            importance he attaches to the patience and determination of the United
                            States in meeting its commitment in Asia. This is what has been called
                            into question by critics in Congress, the Press and across the country.
                            It is for that reason that it is so important that a man like Lee Kuan
                            Yew, who is a highly-regarded Asian leader from a non-aligned country,
                            speak frankly to the Congress and to the public on these issues. If the
                            Prime Minister could say to the Congress and on television some of the
                            things he has been telling U.S. officials in Washington this week, this
                            would be immensely helpful.</p>
                        <p>In response to my inquiry about his recent visit to England and the
                            political situation in Great Britain, he replied that it had been a very
                            dispiriting visit. The pound was in trouble, and the closing of the Suez
                            and the balance of payments were problems of great concern to the Labor
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In answer to my question about possible devaluation of the pound, he
                            stated that if the pound were to be devaluated, it would be the end of
                            the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and most likely the
                            Labor Government. He said the Labor Party was in a “soul destroying”
                            phase. <persName>Wilson</persName> was “doing all bad, hurting his own
                            supporters.” “Labor,” he said, was “not winning a chap from the other
                            side.”</p>
                        <p>“Britain,” he said, “has never been more depressed.” The Labor Party
                            Conference was like “whistling through a cemetery.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> did say, however, that the
                            recent Middle East conflagration may have been the last crisis, and if
                            the pound is not devalued or revalued, that there may be a recovery in
                            the late seventies.</p>

                            economic recovery, but felt the Indonesians were not receptive to

                            Spanish and American rulers nor after the Philippines waited 17 years to
                            bring the issue up. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>

                            resolve the issue. (Telegram <gloss target="#t_VIPTO1">VIPTO</gloss>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> plunged in by
                            telling the President that he had been in Cambodia to receive an
                            honorary degree at the University; and Sihanouk had converted it into a
                            big affair. At his arrival there were no representatives of Hanoi, NLF,
                            or Communist China. At a banquet <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0679"/>he had given a speech which was, for the setting, quite pro-U.S. The
                            representatives of neither Hanoi nor the NLF walked out. At his
                            departure there were representatives of both present at the airfield but
                            not the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>This related, perhaps, to the fact that Hanoi now proposed to send a
                            commercial delegation to Singapore. There is no longer any significant
                            trade between Hanoi and Singapore because the U.S. has knocked out the
                            cement factory and what they mainly bought from North Vietnam was
                            cement. It is <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s judgment
                            they are sending this mission for three reasons:</p>
                        <p>—to demonstrate Hanoi is not Peking;</p>
                        <p>—to increase their propaganda coverage since Singapore is a good enough
                            distribution point;</p>
                        <p>—perhaps for long run political purposes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> said that when President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> won his election in
                            1968, Hanoi will talk. He could not prove that statement to anyone; and
                            he was not given to emphatic statements. But he was prepared to stand on
                            it. He sees a softening in Hanoi's general attitude. They could have
                            treated him in Cambodia like a “cocker spaniel of imperialist U.S.”; but
                            they did not. They are leaving avenues open.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked how Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> had enjoyed his
                            trip in the U.S. He said it was an intensive 10 days of education; but
                            not always pleasant. He was shocked by the disloyalty of some of the
                            youth he saw at Berkeley and by the fact they were simply dirty.
                            Returning to his view of Hanoi, he said there would be no change until
                            the U.S. had demonstrated its staying power to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The President said that only 17% of the American people wished to get out
                            of Vietnam; 35% underwrote his moderate policy; but 45% want to do
                            more—use more military force. The question is, assuming Mr. Nixon is
                            nominated, where will the 17% go? To Nixon or to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>? The second question is, will
                            Nixon be able to pick up the whole 45%.</p>
                        <p>In general, the anti-Vietnam pressure on the President had been
                            diminishing from roughly the time Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> came to the U.S. We have taken
                            some strides in consolidating support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> then observed that he found
                            Senator McCarthy ambitious, rather intelligent, lazy, and interested in
                            making jokes, rather than talking seriously.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to describe the present state of Republican
                            politics and the possible role in the campaign of the candidacy of
                            former Governor Wallace. The President described his problem in Vietnam
                            as how to steer between a Bay of Pigs withdrawal, on the one hand, and
                            an avoidance of escalation and widening of the war, on the other.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> repeated: If you demonstrate
                            your staying power, they will talk. I stake my credibility on that
                            proposition. I have found that it is always best to speak the truth.</p>
                        <p>The President said we shall not compromise or trim in looking for an
                            honorable peace.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with the Prime Minister wishing the President well in
                            the 1968 election.</p>

                        <p>1112. 1. In 1967 some striking changes have been set in motion in
                            Singapore and I thought I would submit the following resume of the more
                            salient of these and meaning as I see it.</p>
                        <p>2. Announced <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intention to run down its
                            military presence here by half in next three-four years and altogether
                            by mid-1970's. Despite adverse economic impact which loss of British
                            presence threatens to bring, GOS professes not to be so concerned about
                            economic results of British withdrawal (flow of Hong Kong capital,
                            revival of Indonesian trade, success in attracting foreign investment
                            into new Jurong industrial complex and belief they can develop foreign
                            markets make GOS confident they can maintain economic growth, which
                            continued in 1967 above eight percent, and finesse their unemployment
                            problem). GOS most concerned about political and security problems that
                            may develop as British leave. I believe this GOS concern is sound and
                            that if British pull out completely before late 70's, some alternative
                            to British military presence will have to be found if
                            Malaysian-Singaporean stability is not to be endangered.</p>
                        <p>3. Establishment of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Singapore
                            and restoration of trade to pre-confrontation level. Resurgence of
                            travel and commerce between Indonesia and Singapore, much of it still
                            unregulated from Indonesia's viewpoint, is boon to both but until
                            greater control of the illegal practices can be implemented between <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0681"/>the two countries there is
                            always danger that Indonesian resentment of Singapore and of Chinese who
                            dominate in the trade will again become an Indonesian obsession
                            detrimental to both.</p>
                        <p>4. Establishment of border crossing control and separate currencies by
                            Malaysia and Singapore. While these additional steps of separation
                            between these formerly federated and still interdependent countries have
                            created some additional impediment to travel and trade, the effect does
                            not seem yet to have been serious. Should a differential develop in the
                            value of the respective currencies negating interchangeability there
                            would be some additional awkwardness but it would not be insurmountable.
                            Coolness between respective governments, especially Prime Ministers,
                            continues, indicative of suspicions with which <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> and some of his cohorts regard
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> and reflective of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s unfortunate tendency
                            to make negative noises (happily not in public in recent months), about
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>, his government and the
                            Malays. If Malaysian economy should deteriorate seriously and Singapore
                            continue to prosper to point of strikingly invidious comparisons, I
                            would expect relations between two countries to worsen as result.</p>
                        <p>5. Establishment of trade missions by and expansion of trade and
                            diplomatic relations with Eastern European and other Communist
                            countries. Implementing their credo of trading with all (who will give
                            them acceptable terms), Singapore greatly extended the nexus of
                            relationships with Communist countries in 1967. There is every evidence
                            that GOS is well aware of the political trickery that may lurk behind
                            the exchange, however, and that they are on guard. Because the left wing
                            in Singapore appears to be relatively less disaffected and better
                            disciplined than in Malaysia and because communal relationships here
                            also seem less volatile—hence less exploitable by the Communists—I
                            regard the presence of a Soviet mission in Singapore as potentially far
                            less dangerous than in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
                        <p>6. Growth of Singapore as buyer of and entrepot for Chinese Communist
                            goods. Partly as result of troubles in Hong Kong, Singapore trade with
                            China expanded markedly in 1967. <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">ChiCom</gloss>s have offered easy credit terms through Bank of
                            China for an ever greater variety of goods at extremely cheap prices and
                            have subsidized rent of outlets. As a result, several new, so-called
                            “emporia” devoted exclusively to the sale of these goods have been set
                            up and the variety and quantity of food, clothing and other articles
                            offered have found increased demand among Singapore's largely Chinese
                            population. Singapore has also served increasingly as trans-shipment
                            point for these goods to neighboring countries and has emerged as the
                            biggest foreign exchange earner for Communist China next to Hong Kong.
                            Perhaps rationalizing fact that these goods help Singapore hold line on
                            wages, GOS professed not to be worried about potential for blackmail
                            that may lurk in local <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0682"/>dependence on <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">ChiCom</gloss> made goods. I
                            am worried about long-term effect of this.</p>
                        <p>7. Further consolidation of <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s
                            People's Action Party control. The Peking-Lining Barisan Sosialis Party
                            (BSP) abandoned parliamentary and electoral competition and turned to a
                            program of street demonstrations which signally failed to accomplish
                            anything except add to Singapore's prison population. This due in part
                            to curious failure of BSP to address itself to real local issues and in
                            part to effectiveness of Singapore police controls. At same time, GOS
                            crippled BSP allies in the trade union movement by eliminating left wing
                            unions. These developments left <gloss target="#t_PAP1">PAP</gloss>
                            power at highest point ever and contributed to its objective of creating
                            “tightly knit” and “rugged” society that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> sees as essential if Singapore is to survive
                            critical decade ahead. But despite success, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> remains concerned over increasingly serious
                            unemployment problem and implications for Singapore of possible revival
                            Communist insurgency in Malaysia. Communal strife that broke out in
                            Malaysia in November in wake of controversy over devaluation regarded by
                            GOS as indicative of dangers that lurk among disgruntled elements of
                            Chinese community in Malaysia. They blame <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> for mishandling communal problem but despite these
                            worries and although he has to take care that he does not offend the
                            more China-oriented Chinese in Singapore, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> strengthened his political control in 1967 and the
                            fate of Singapore, so far as anyone in Singapore can decide it, is very
                            much in his hands.</p>
                        <p>8. Happier notes in context <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>/GOS
                            relationship emerging in 1967 were: (a) close cooperation at working
                            level by security forces Malaysia and Singapore, especially during riots
                            in Penang, (b) possibly as result of riots and of security problems
                            expected to follow British military pullout, there seems to be renewed
                            realization of interdependence in matters of security by both Malaysian
                            and Singaporean leaders, (c) both sides appear to be thinking in terms
                            of future cooperation, perhaps along with Australia and New Zealand, in
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>9. Assignment Singapore's first Ambassador to U.S. in March and Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s visit to U.S. in
                            October. These were only part of growing evidence of greater acceptance
                            and approval of U.S. by GOS in 1967. Although he did some public
                            backtracking upon his return from U.S. visit (revealing, I believe,
                            sensitivity of less assimilated elements among Singapore's Chinese
                            community and of his own only indirect and tenuous personal rapport with
                            them), <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has continued
                            privately to express his unequivocal support for U.S. defeat of
                            Communist aggression in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>10. Singapore's joining with Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
                            Philippines to form <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>. This was
                            only part, though most important, evidence thus far that Singapore is
                            placing its long-term <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0683"/>bets for
                            survival on regional cooperation with its neighbors. But GOS puts little
                            faith in regionalism as short-term answer to Singapore's economic or
                            security problems or, for that matter, Southeast Asia's.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s visit to Cambodia in
                            December, designed partly to burnish his non-aligned image after his
                            forthright statements on Vietnam in the U.S., and partly to try to
                            encourage Sihanouk to look more favorably on regional association. I
                            believe evidence suggests that while <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s tête-à-tête with Sihanouk may have made some
                            superficial contribution to <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s non-aligned credentials, his divergence with Sihanouk
                            on important issues like U.S. presence in Vietnam and regional
                            association with U.S. allies like Thailand, and Philippines was made
                            more manifest by their exchanges.</p>
                        <p>12. Dramatic change in <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s
                            attitude toward U.S. Although Lee Kuan Yew has not entirely given up
                            hope that something will happen to hold some British military presence
                            in Singapore, he is not planning on it. He is aware that Singapore's
                            security as a non-Communist entity depends more and more on presence of
                            U.S. military might in Southeast Asia. Evidence accumulated during year
                            suggests that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> was toying
                            very much with idea of trying to clear new path that would eventually
                            lead to U.S. assumption de facto British protective relationship with
                            Singapore, that he got well out ahead of an important segment of his
                            Cabinet and constituents in this respect, and that he has accordingly
                            revised his estimate of the time required to overcome Chinese antipathy
                            in Singapore to anything, such as alignment with U.S., that would
                            suggest that Singapore is taking sides against China. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>'s remark to me (Singapore tel

                            his generation can prepare the way for a close relationship between the
                            U.S. and Singapore but that it will be the next generation which can
                            implement and realize the full import of it, was revealing in this
                            respect. Although <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> shares
                            some of the ethnic resentment of indignities inflicted by the West on
                            the Chinese nation in the past, his behavior in 1967 suggested strongly
                            that he is in most other respects pro-West in outlook. In some of his
                            public off-record talks in U.S. and in private then and since, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> has come as close to declaring his
                            personal support for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> as Southeast Asian leader professing
                            non-alignment could be expected to do.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> wishes to convey his
                            admiration for your whole conduct of policy in Southeast Asia and also
                            for your personal sacrifice of March 31. He doubtless recalls vividly
                            your meeting with him in Melbourne, at which you reviewed the political
                            prospects with some frankness, told him the Republicans would nominate
                            Mr. Nixon, and pretty clearly hinted that you thought you could beat
                            him. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> probably agrees.</p>
                        <p>No doubt he would again be fascinated by a frank personal forecast of how
                            the Nixon Administration, and above all, the American public will be
                            looking at Southeast Asia in the next few years. He thinks—and probably
                            rightly—his own life and future depend on that judgment. Past experience
                            should give you confidence that he will keep what you say wholly to
                            himself.</p>
                        <p>More specifically, the British decision to pull out of Malaysia and
                            Singapore after the end of 1971 came after your Melbourne meeting, and
                            has preoccupied him all through the year. He thinks, as we do, that a
                            clear Australian stand, including the willingness to keep limited ground
                            forces in the area, is the key to post-1971 security for him. And he is
                            as baffled and dubious about Prime Minister Gorton as we are. I probed
                            him at length on this when I saw him in Cambridge two weeks ago, and he
                            came up with one interesting thought—that a continuing American military
                            presence in Thailand would go very far to convince Gorton that he had to
                            do his share in Malaysia and Singapore. The latest we ourselves have on
                            this is that the Australians have made a general decision for a “forward
                            strategy” rather than a “Fortress Australia” view; however, this appears
                            to be very general, and he would <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0685"/>doubtless welcome a frank exchange on what goes on in Gorton's mind—as
                            if anybody knew.</p>
                        <p>Another possible topic might be the future of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> in view of the spat between Malaysia and the
                            Philippines over Sabah. Again, his thinking is like ours—that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has made a fool of himself—and
                            his government has expressed blunt support of Malaysia's position. The
                            question is how to get <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> off
                            the hook and who can help.</p>
                        <p>In general, Singapore under <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            is continuing to do a superb job, and in the past year has scored some
                            outstanding successes in attracting American investment. He thinks this
                            is fine, and is also most anxious to have our Navy and Air Force use his
                            repair facilities on a commercial basis. We have started this, and it is
                            going satisfactorily.</p>
                        <p>You should know of one minor issue, although I doubt very much that he
                            would raise it. Singapore (and the Philippines as well) wants a license
                            to manufacture the AR–15 rifle—the commercial version of the M–16.
                            Secretary Clifford has reservations about this, and we have not come to
                            any decision. In the remote event he raises this, I believe you should
                            be sympathetic but noncommittal.</p>
                        <p>On my observation and by all other accounts, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> is in a relaxed and forthcoming mood. He should be
                            good value.</p>
                        <p>On press handling, <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName>
                            understands that his call is being made public. However, he would
                            strongly prefer not to be exposed to the press for the purpose of making
                            any remarks. This is in line with his unofficial status, which he has
                            observed with the greatest care in the month he has been here.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee Kuan Yew</persName> met

                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> sent Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GFJ2">Galbraith</persName> a personal and eyes
                            only letter, December 12, describing the conversation.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s account reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In the talk with the President, Ong and I were also present, although I
                            had thought the President would wish to see him dead alone. The talk
                            started a little slowly, but finally became quite relaxed and the
                            President engaged in a considerable amount of personal reflection and
                            reminiscences but also in some serious questioning of <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> about Singapore and Southeast
                            Asia. <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> readily handled his
                            end beautifully, with just the <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0686"/>right amount of sincere praise for the President's guts and
                            determination, and a very frank and clear statement of how vital our
                            sticking in Vietnam remained in his judgment. He also threw in some
                            useful comments on Gorton and, for good measure, on Sihanouk—to the
                            general effect that the latter readily depended on us just as much as
                            everyone else in the area, even though he would hardly show it.</p>
                        <p>“However, I must tell you in the utmost confidence that some of the
                            President's remarks may have left an unfortunate impression about the
                            firmness and resolve of the new Administration. The President said that
                            he had no doubt whatsoever of Mr. Nixon's personal views and intentions,
                            but he then went on to say that he doubted very much that Mr. Nixon
                            would stand up to the 'soft' advice he would get from the new Secretary
                            of State, Rogers, from Laird, and in general from the 'soft liberals.'
                            The net impression can well have been that Mr. Nixon would end up doing
                            just about anything to get out of Vietnam on any terms at all, and that
                            his standing in Southeast Asia was open to grave doubt. Quite frankly my
                            own impression was that the President was indulging in the kind of
                            disparagement of any successor that I have sometimes heard—in similar
                            periods—from other senior officials. There was a good deal of the tone
                            of 'I am a giant, and these men are pygmies.' It may or may not turn out
                            to be true, but I am not sure that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> discounted it to the extent that I personally would
                            do as of now.</p>
                        <p>“Into the bargain, the President made some very uncomplimentary remarks
                            about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>'s campaign
                            speeches on the bombing, and this too may have left the impression that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> and the dominant
                            wing of the Democratic Party were ready to pull the plug in Southeast
                            Asia. I injected myself once or twice to demur on this, but I doubt if I
                            countered the impression the President was leaving. Nor do I think I was
                            able to do so afterward—by further corrective efforts—believing as I do
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> would in the
                            end be at least as firm as Mr. Nixon, and that both would stand up to a
                            considerable degree to the kinds of pressures that anyone can see.</p>
                        <p>“The point, of course, is that <persName corresp="#p_LKY1">Lee</persName> may well be putting together his Harvard experience
                            and what the President told him, into a very gloomy forecast indeed of
                            future American intentions in Southeast Asia—and this is the serious
                            possibility that warrants my telling you what was said.</p>
                        <p>“However, as I write this, there is one card left to be played, and that
                            is his talk with Kissinger tomorrow. I myself am seeing Kissinger on
                            other matters tonight, and will tell him quite frankly that he has a job
                            to do—although I would not suggest that he give any flat assurances.”

                        <p>On January 13, 1964, at 1:11 p.m., President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> telephoned his Special Assistant for National
                            Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>,
                            and asked his opinion of appointing the former Governor of New Jersey,
                            John Meyner, as Ambassador to the Philippines. The President and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> discussed Meyner's qualifications. The
                            President then asked: “How sensitive is the Philippines post?” <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> replied:</p>
                        <p>“Very. But the principal thing in the Philippines is to establish a
                            working personal relationship with Macapagal. Professional staff can be
                            provided underneath it. That is where <persName corresp="#p_SWE1">Stevenson</persName> has failed, and where I think Meyner would
                            have a much better chance for success. He is temperamentally much more
                            an outgoing man than his father-in-law [current Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE1">William E. Stevenson</persName> was Meyner's
                            father-in-law].”</p>

                            <persName>Bundy</persName> and the President next discussed the possible
                            reaction to Meyner's appointment. <persName>Bundy</persName> promised to
                            “take a temperature” reading at the Department of State “in an innocent
                            way.” The President warned him not to mention Meyner's name to anybody
                            because he was “just so damned afraid it will be in the paper.” (Johnson

                                propose a pre-election visit.” <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> wrote the following note on the memorandum:

                            just decided to enlarge its assistance program for South Viet-Nam and to
                            appropriate over 900,000 pesos for that purpose. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked what projects were to be
                            financed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName>
                            mentioned psychological warfare specialists, medical teams, and
                            community development teams. The President said that he was glad that
                            the Philippines would be “showing its flag” and inquired how many
                            persons would be involved in the programs. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName> said that he would inform the

                                    should accomplish. In general, the Embassy suggested, it was “an

                                    to reaffirm their countries' close relationship, and to

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> is both pro-American and
                            a Philippine nationalist.</p>
                        <p>At 54, he has led his country for almost three years during which he has
                            shown greater interest in regional and international affairs than any of
                            his predecessors. He has supported us in the important areas (operation
                            of our bases in the Philippines, Vietnam) but at times his nationalism
                            has led him to follow less constructive lines (his earlier Indonesian
                            policy, claim to Sabah or North Borneo). In the past year, he has shown
                            considerably more responsibility than in his first years in office.</p>
                        <p>He has been only moderately successful with his domestic programs, which
                            emphasize economic and social reform, and he must cope with an
                            uncooperative Congress, resistance from powerful vested interests and
                            poor public support.</p>
                        <p>Of very humble origin, he is extremely sensitive and prestige conscious
                            and is not particularly warm or genial. His wife wields considerable
                            influence over him.</p>
                        <p>He visited the United States as Vice President in 1960. You met him in
                            1961 on your world trip and at President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s funeral. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> was here last month to place their daughter,
                            Gloria, (17) in Georgetown University.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. His Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. To establish for domestic Philippine consumption that he is a close
                            friend of, well regarded by, and an equal partner with the United States
                                <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0690"/>President. To bear this
                            out, he requires some tangible signs of our trust and esteem. He will
                            attach importance to the commitment from us to supply P.L. 480 rice next
                            year.</p>
                        <p>2. To reiterate his support for United States policies in Asia and to
                            volunteer new support.</p>
                        <p>3. To explain his disillusion and apprehension regarding Sukarno and
                            obtain increased military assistance to bolster Philippine southern
                            defenses against potential Indonesian subversion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Our Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. To reassure him as to our policies, purposes and determination.</p>
                        <p>2. To promote close U.S.-Philippine cooperation in defense and world
                            affairs, especially toward Communist China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam
                            and Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. To express our concern over the threat to established American
                            investment in the Philippines posed by the Retail Trade Nationalization
                            Law.</p>
                        <p>4. To indicate explicitly our commendation for Philippine efforts to
                            introduce social reform in their society. To suggest discreetly our
                            friendship for <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>D. Major Topics of Your Talks Are Expected To Be:</p>

                        <p>A memorandum on this subject will be submitted separately.<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">Not found.</note>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may stress the
                            Philippines has recently undergone a dramatic shift in attitude toward
                            Indonesia and describe the importance he attaches to increasing
                            Philippine military strength in Mindanao, the large southern island, to
                            discourage known Indonesian penetration. He may ask for a sizeable
                            increase in our military assistance program to support his southern
                            defenses.</p>
                        <p>You should express our concern regarding Indonesian expansionism, and
                            note our efforts to restrain Sukarno and the determination of the
                            British to retaliate if mainland Malaysia is again attacked. Our
                            bilateral defense agreement with the Philippines serves to insulate the
                            Philippines from overt attack from Indonesia, and we agree the
                            Philippines should improve their military posture in the south to
                            withstand and control subversion. His defense advisers are in touch with
                            ours on this and we are prepared to re-examine the existing military
                            assistance program and consider specific Philippine suggestions or
                            requests. We would be interested in knowing what the chances are of
                            increased Philippine budgetary support for its armed forces.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may explain his latest
                            efforts to resolve the dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia through
                            the medium of an Afro-Asian Conciliation Commission, and describe his
                            claim to Sabah (or North Borneo).</p>
                        <p>You should express appreciation for his efforts and the hope the
                            Philippines will soon restore diplomatic relations with Malaysia. You
                            should also mention that the Malaysians will understandably insist that
                            attacks against them cease and Indonesian guerrillas be withdrawn before
                            they accept the Afro-Asian Conciliation Commission. Suggest you not
                            comment on the North Borneo claim, a dispute between two of our
                            friends.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will raise his need for
                            P.L. 480 rice.</p>
                        <p>You should reply that despite limited availabilities of rice, we are
                            prepared, on the basis of Philippine need, to extend to him in 1965
                            100,000 tons of rice under P.L. 480, Title I, on same basis as the 1964
                            transaction except for certain minor changes (such as in the handling of
                            freight charges) required by recent legislation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may suggest a revision
                            of the military base agreement be undertaken quietly, through diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>You should tell him that we are prepared to consider this suggestion and
                            that we are making every effort to assure that he is informed regarding
                            the use of our bases in this critical period.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may express both concern
                            over this and the hope that Philippine Air Lines be permitted to fly a
                            route from Manila through Tokyo to California or Seattle.</p>
                        <p>You should state that we share <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s concern over the unresolved aviation
                            problems between our two countries and we are prepared to sit down with
                            the Philippines to negotiate. If agreement could be reached on general
                            principles (on rates, capacities and undertakings not to apply
                            unilateral restrictions) and if a Manila-Tokyo-Seattle route—in addition
                            to the route currently operated by Philippine Air Lines—is acceptable to
                            the Filipinos, we believe a successful negotiation is possible.</p>

                                “plushed up” at the cost of $20,000 and serve as an executive

                            that he expected to discuss the Viet-Nam situation with you, that he

                            the trouble might be that the American advisers and military units,
                            being “Westerners and white men,” seemed to the Vietnamese little
                            different from the French and are consequently unable to “convey a sense
                            of common purpose to them.” He suggested that the 16,000 American
                            soldiers in Viet-Nam be replaced by an equal number of Filipinos and
                            Thais. He recognized that “massive logistic support and ultimate control
                            must remain in American hands.” He said he was confident of obtaining
                            Congressional support if Philippine participation were not unilateral
                            but shared with the Thais. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> concluded that he did not wish to seem

                        <p>We are not sure of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s
                            motivation in making this offer. We are aware of the shortcomings of the
                            Philippine armed forces, and are doubtful that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> could obtain Congressional
                            backing for a venture of this sort. Nevertheless, we believe that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s proposal might be
                            developed into real and active Philippine participation in support of
                            the GVN. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> seems to be
                            sincerely concerned about the Viet-Nam situation; we believe that
                            Philippine political leadership could be brought to support a
                            substantially higher level of Philippine involvement, and that the
                            problem is to devise levels and forms of participation which are tenable
                            in terms of Philippine capabilities and acceptable to Philippine public
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Philippine Capabilities</p>
                        <p>Given the above criteria, we believe the Philippines could produce forces
                            such as the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Aircraft crews for support of the Viet-Nam Air Force.</p>
                        <p>B. Special Forces company.</p>
                        <p>C. Engineer platoons (up to 6).</p>
                        <p>D. Medical platoons (up to 3).</p>
                        <p>E. Personnel in such technical fields as signal, ordnance,
                            transportation, and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>F. Marine/Navy personnel to assist the South Vietnamese in junk fleet
                            training and similar maritime counter-insurgency operations.</p>
                        <p>We understand that use of any of the foregoing outside the Philippines
                            would require Philippine Congressional authorization. In addition,
                            however, the Philippine Government could produce without specific
                            Congressional authorization (if funds were available):</p>
                        <p>G. Significantly increased numbers of civilian medical, engineering, and
                            construction personnel and a variety of specialists to work in the civic
                            action field such as agricultural experts. The Philippines could also
                            contribute fertilizer.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Financing</p>
                        <p>1. The current Philippine budget will not cover the increased costs
                            required for these activities. We are sure that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will expect the United States
                            to provide the necessary financing.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>2. We expect that, in addition to requesting us to finance Philippine
                            activities in South Viet-Nam, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will use his proposal as a point of departure
                            for further requests for significant increases in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Saigon Reaction</p>
                        <p>Asked to comment on the Philippine capabilities listed above, Embassy
                            Saigon has replied that any or all would be most welcome and has added
                            that Filipinos already in the country are working out well.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bangkok Reaction</p>
                        <p>Embassy Bangkok believes it is most unlikely that the Thai would be
                            willing to go along with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s proposal. The Embassy believes, however, that
                            the Thai can be encouraged to increase economic aid considerably and,
                            with proper handling, to augment their military assistance somewhat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>We believe <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will be
                            raising his proposal with you, and indeed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> will be suggesting to him that
                            he do so. I suggest that you reply along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. We are delighted that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            agrees with us in his assessment of the importance of Asians helping
                            Asians in Viet-Nam. We have been most impressed by the ability and
                            devotion of the Filipinos already in Viet-Nam. The nature and depth of
                            our commitment in Viet-Nam is such that we cannot, however, take action
                            which appears to constitute American withdrawal or lessening of
                            interest, as this would be misread in Viet-Nam as well as by the Chinese
                            and others.</p>
                        <p>2. At the same time, we believe the Philippines could make an important
                            contribution by committing Philippine armed forces, in addition to
                            making a significant increase in civilian participation in support of
                            civic action.</p>
                        <p>3. Work on this should be done very quietly and, if <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> agrees in principle, you and
                            he will instruct your representatives to get together to prepare
                            detailed plans. You would hope that the subject could be discussed
                            further at your second meeting.</p>
                        <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> raises the question
                            of United States financing for increased Philippine activities in
                            Viet-Nam or of increased <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, you should
                            tell him that in principle the United States will be willing to help out
                            with respect to financing the activities in Viet-Nam, but you should
                            give him no encouragement with respect to increased <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0697"/>These subjects should be discussed by your respective
                            staffs in the course of preparing the detailed plans mentioned
                            above.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense concurs in this memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">The Joint Chiefs of Staff informed <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in <gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>-347–64, October 3, that, “since
                                neither Thailand nor the Philippines has an industrial base, their
                                contributions, especially in economic and social fields, must be
                                largely in terms of personnel and skills.” The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommended contributions in civic
                                action and counterinsurgency operations, and noted that both
                                Thailand and the Philippines would regard these contributions as a
                                basis for increases in their U.S. Military Assistance Program. The
                                Joint Chiefs stated that replacement of U.S. military personnel in
                                South Vietnam by Thai and Filipino military personnel was
                                “impractical.” (Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff Files,

                        <p>Talking Points for <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>. He
                            clearly expects that Vietnam will be uppermost on your mind, and will
                            probably make his offer to help. We want to embrace enthusiastically the
                            idea of more Fil aid, but steer him on to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on the more dubious specifics.</p>
                        <p>Since these people are [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>], I'd urge you have at least Bill
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> or Blair in the room, both to protect
                            your flank and to give us a quick readout for the talks to follow.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. We're determined to see this through
                            (a firm line will reassure <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>). Depth of our commitment is such that we
                            couldn't appear to be pulling out. This would be misread in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> as well as by Chicoms.</p>
                        <p>2. But we enthusiastically agree that there should be more Asians helping
                            Asians. We're impressed with performance of Fils already there, and
                            would warmly welcome more. The two governments should get together and
                            prepare detailed plans.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Indonesia-Malaysia</hi>. Flatter Macapagal by
                            frankly asking his advice on how to keep this dispute from blowing
                            up.</p>
                        <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0698"/>
                        <p>4. We appreciate Fil mediation on Malaysia dispute and agree with idea of
                            “Asian” solution. But we can see why <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName> insists Sukarno stop attacks and pull out
                            guerillas first. We hope Fils will restore diplomatic relations with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAR2">Tunku</persName>. No comment if he
                            brings up Fil claim to N. Borneo.</p>
                        <p>5. If he switches to Indo threat to Philippines, we think that our
                            bilateral defense agreement and Seventh Fleet will insulate Fils from
                            overt attack. As to subversive threat, we agree Fils should strengthen
                            their defensive posture in South. Let's consult on this, but Fils too
                            must help by more budgetary support for their own forces. We hope to
                            avoid the big new <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> commitment Fils
                            want.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Rice</hi>. Our supply is limited, but we can provide
                            100,000 tons on same basis as 1964 except for minor changes required by
                            new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 law (e.g. freight
                            charges).</p>
                        <p>7. We want to complain about threat to US investment from new Fil Retail
                            Trade Nationalization Law. He's on our side, but should be told that
                            this law jeopardizes long-established US businesses in Philippines. We
                            couldn't get any legislation favorable to Fils through Congress if this
                            is not settled.</p>
                        <p>8. If he raises our <hi rend="italic">base rights</hi>, we'll consider
                            any proposition he has.</p>
                        <p>9. If he raises new air route, we're prepared to negotiate and think Fils
                            could have a Manila-Tokyo-Seattle route if agreement can be reached on
                            rates, capacities, no unilateral restrictions, etc.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">On veterans claims</hi>, we'll buy a joint
                            committee but want to discourage him on Omnibus Claims.</p>
                        <p>11. If he wants the special education fund set up under the new War
                            Damage law to be used in his land reform program, we'll look at this
                            carefully. We need suitable auditing procedure to satisfy both
                            Congresses however.</p>
                        <p>12. If he <hi rend="italic">raises Laurel-Langley</hi> trade agreement
                            (parity clause protecting US business operations is now under fire),
                            we're prepared to study any proposals Fils may have.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting, we have the boat ceremony in Fish Room with press and
                            guests.</p>
                        <p>N.B. Special warmth to this highly sensitive man is as important as what
                            we can give him. With some discreet hints from us, he's going to laud
                            our VN role in speeches here.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> stated that the
                            Philippines were ready to send to South Viet-Nam trained personnel in

                            many as useful.” In response to Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s inquiry
                            whether the President had any specific number in mind, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> stated that this

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> stated that
                            with such increased Philippine participation they would wish to have at
                            least “some sprinkling” of additional Thai participation. He implied
                            that it would be difficult for the Philippines to take these further
                            steps unless another Asian country were participating.</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> agreed to such

                            President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> showed clear
                            pleasure at this statement and the matter was left at that.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Special Fund for Education.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> alluded to the
                            $25 million that might be available for educational purposes from war
                            damage claims. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            immediately responded that we were prepared to have a joint commission
                            look into this matter and see what uses could be developed.</p>
                        <p>At a later point in the conversation, President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> came back to the importance of
                            his land reform program and his hope that the US could be directly
                            associated with it through the use of the fund in connection with land
                            reform. During this discussion, he also alluded very favorably to the US
                            treatment of the Philippines in contrast to the treatment of other
                            countries by their colonial powers.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> raised this
                            issue and indicated that it was causing serious problems for American
                            businessmen and for future American business in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> responded that
                            he had done his best, and certified the necessary legal cases to the
                            courts. He said that his main problem was that the Senate was controlled
                            by the opposing party, and that he must therefore simply campaign just
                            as hard as he could to get a friendly Senate and Congress in the 1965
                            elections. He expressed confidence that his own campaigning ability
                            could produce a successful outcome at that time.</p>

                        <p>In response to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on Viet-Nam, President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> said that he first sensed that
                            something was wrong back in 1960. He said that he detected that the
                            efforts of the Vietnamese Government lacked the support of the people.
                            “When the people are not behind the effort, it is bound to collapse,” he
                            said. The President suggested that more participation by Filipinos “and
                            perhaps by Thais” would be useful. “We are nervous ourselves,” he said.
                            “We are in danger too if anything happens.” With Indonesia headed the
                            way she is, the President said that it was time that the Filipinos
                            shifted their defenses southward. He said this is already under way and
                            that they were using the increase in smuggling as an excuse for the
                            shift.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he
                            was seriously concerned by the level of the Filipino defense budget.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> replied saying, “It
                            is my peculiar misfortune to be the first President in our history
                            working with an opposition congress.” The Secretary said, “I speak of
                            this reluctantly because your strength depends upon your economic
                            growth. I realize you have internal political problems but the dangers
                            ahead are too great for you to keep your defense efforts at such a low
                            level.” The President replied, “We are studying the situation and I may
                            call a special session of Congress to augment our military
                            preparations.” The President said that the purpose of calling the
                            special session would be to increase revenues both for defense and for
                            schools, and he suggested <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0702"/>that
                            even if Congress is controlled by the opposition, it would find it
                            difficult to oppose these measures.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary Hechanova interrupted to say there had been a
                            restoration of earlier cuts in the defense budget. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that this was a good
                            first step but inadequate in and of itself. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then asked the President what
                            size force he had in mind when he talked about an increase in Filipino
                            participation in the war in Viet-Nam. The President turned to General
                            Lapus who gave the figure of between 1,000 and 1,200—“a battalion combat
                            team,” he said. President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> commented that he thought the Filipinos could
                            be most useful in terms of technical assistance and civil action groups.
                            He said that the Vietnamese are weary after 20 years of war and that
                            France had not given them enough “technical know-how.” The President
                            pointed out that there exists a school of public administration at the
                            University of the Philippines. He said that “We can live with the
                            natives but it will be difficult for Filipinos to do it alone.”
                            “Perhaps,” he said, “a sprinkling of Thais is needed.” When asked by the
                            Secretary as to whether he felt the Thais would be receptive to this
                            idea, he answered in the affirmative saying that “if Viet-Nam falls, the
                            Thais will be next.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that “We
                            would be delighted to join with your staff” in studying both the
                            possibility of an increased Filipino participation in Viet-Nam and the
                            shifting of Philippine defense to the south.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">Secretary of Finance Hechanova discussed the projected shift in
                                Philippine defense posture with Assistant Secretary of Defense
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> at the
                                Pentagon, on October 2. Hechanova stated that the highest levels of
                                the Philippine Government had decided that a major threat to the
                                Philippines came from Indonesia in addition to the previously
                                recognized threat of China. The Philippine Government was planning
                                to move military forces south under the guise of anti-smuggling
                                operations. Hechanova also pointed out the danger of subversion in
                                the southern Philippines because of Mindanao's close religious and
                                cultural ties to Indonesia. This was the reason for Philippine
                                claims to North Borneo now that the British were leaving.
                                (Memorandum of conversation, October 2; Washington National Records
                                Center, RG 330, OASD/ISA Files: FRC 68 A 306, Philippines,
                                320.2—702)</note> When asked by the Secretary whether he had any
                            views on the Vietnamese desire to expand the war, the President said, “I
                            am not a military man but you will have to cut the supply routes if you
                            want to win.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, “We will set up a joint study to see what can be
                            done. If you raise your budget, we will do what we can to supplement it.
                            We are limited in what we can do but we will study it.” Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that perhaps
                            what is needed most by the Filipinos is a counter-insurgency force to
                            deal with infiltration from the south.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> talked for
                            awhile on the threat of Communist China and pointed out that all of the
                            Asian countries are fearful of Red <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0703"/>China. He then said, “I do not know if you have written
                            off Indonesia” and went on to say that he felt every effort should be
                            made to make sure that Indonesia will not be lost to the Communists. The
                            President said that the poverty of the Indonesian people was so bad that
                            “I doubt if in the long run Indonesia can be a real threat.” The
                            Secretary said that the United States certainly had not written off
                            Indonesia. The President said that both China and the Soviet Union were
                            trying to keep Indonesia from moving to the other side and pointed out
                            that “since we are neighbors to Indonesia, we can talk to them.” He said
                            that Sukarno agreed with him that China was a grave threat and said that
                            if only the West could come up with some role for Indonesia to play
                            which would at the same time give Sukarno a chance to help his people,
                            “this might do it.”<note n="3" xml:id="d301fn3">At 10 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to discuss the

                            needed some kind of “golden bridge” (i.e. aid) to justify his climbing

                            find some way to help the Fils re-orient their defenses to the south,

                            Assistance to South Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hechanova stated that the Philippine contingent would be trained and
                            ready to go to South Vietnam in March or early April. He further
                            indicated that his news media contained some disturbing reports to the
                            effect that the Korean contingent proposed for Vietnam would be U.S.
                            sponsored mercenaries. In an effort to avoid similar charges levied
                            against the U.S. and the Philippine Governments, the Minister of
                            Defense, Peralta, had instructed Mr. Hechanova to request a lump sum
                            grant in advance to the Government of the Philippines, and that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would request an appropriation
                            of an equivalent amount of pesos from their own sources to support the
                            2500-man contingent to South Vietnam. (The implication is that the
                            Philippine appropriation would not be acted upon, but serve as a
                            cover.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hechanova stated that financial assistance for the Philippine
                            internal propaganda campaign to sell to the Philippine public the
                            concept of armed forces assistance to South Vietnam would also come out
                            of the advance grant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hechanova relayed Mr. Peralta's opposition to any moves to reduce the
                            present and proposed Philippine level of per diem ($15 per day for field
                            grade officers, $12 for company grade, and $8 for enlisted men). Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> reminded Mr.
                            Hechanova that U.S. representatives in Manila are in the process of
                            negotiating with the Philippine Defense Secretary, Mr. Peralta, on the
                            method of U.S. financial support, <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0706"/>and that the per diem question was also under
                            consideration, but that a decision could not be made until we received a
                            report from our representatives on these negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> also indicated that we
                            wished to be fair in the question of per diem pay. Mr. Hechanova
                            rationalized that the per diem level was based on the precedent set with
                            the medical and psy-operations teams of 34 Philippine personnel
                            presently in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Blouin</persName> stated that we were
                            hoping to obtain a reduction on what we consider to be an excessive per
                            diem payment and commented with respect to effect on Koreans and
                            Vietnamese. Mr. Hechanova responded that any reduction would have an
                            adverse effect on the morale of the Philippine military and recruitment
                            of volunteers for Vietnam, stating further that the Philippines has a
                            higher living standard than those other countries of Asia, and that he
                            did not feel it was proper to send the Philippine military to Vietnam
                            with less money than they received at home. Admiral Blouin questioned
                            this statement. Hechanova modified it—Philippine Government could not
                            reduce per diem from that already approved.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Philippine Shopping List</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hechanova proposed that partial proceeds from <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480, Title I funds be allocated to the purchase for the
                            Army of additional earth moving and road construction equipment. Along
                            with road construction equipment, they would like to have additional
                            helicopters. The reason for these requests is to expand the road and
                            communication network in Mindanao in an attempt to bring remote areas in
                            better contact with markets, and provide an excuse for Army presence in
                            remote areas through road construction and easier access to those areas
                            for purposes of security. In effect, they would be creating a
                            pre-emptory counter-insurgency effort. He stated that the areas
                            concerned were made up mostly of Moslem communities having an affinity
                            for Indonesia and the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would like to
                            get in first in view of the potential Indonesian infiltration and
                            insurgency threat and the possibility of Indonesia going Communist. In
                            this same regard, Mr. Hechanova mentioned that proposals were being
                            developed to obtain finances through the New York money marts for a
                            north to south national railway through the Island of Mindanao. The
                            foregoing efforts are designed to tie together the outlying areas and
                            pave the way for closer government control and influence through
                            economic means.</p>

                        <p>In this regard, Mr. Hechanova issued a plea for a return to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support of <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss>

                            consumable supplies, for the reason that these functions were considered
                            to be a stimulus to the local economy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Philippine Defense Budget</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> posed the question of
                            whether funds actually released to the Philippine Department of Defense
                            were measuring up to those authorized and if they were adequate to meet
                            defense expenditures. Mr. Hechanova stated that they were approaching
                            equalization but that a new scheme of submitting budgets to the
                            Philippine Congress would be placed in effect for the first time this
                            year. This formula would involve setting up four major categories of
                            special funds derived from special specific tax revenue bill to be
                            treated as separate budget items placed before the Congress: (1)
                            education; (2) defense; (3) various categorized roadbuilding projects;
                            and (4) medical health. If this improved formula is successful, the
                            special fund for defense would add an additional $40–50 million to the
                            defense budget and he had high hopes that the new formula would be
                            successful and prove palatable to his Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPOA1">Solbert</persName> stated that he was glad
                            to have the chance to hear the Philippine position first hand. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> thanked the
                            visitors for a very clear presentation of their problems and stated that
                            the information provided would be very helpful in arriving at a decision
                            on the Country Team assessment of these issues which is expected
                            shortly.</p>

                            in which the Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested to implement the
                            agreements reached during the 5–6 October 1964 meeting with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide you with the views of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff on a <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            study, contained in Appendix B hereto,<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">Appendixes A–C are attached but not printed.</note> which outlines
                            steps that the United States might take to assist the Government of the
                            Philippines in shifting its military emphasis to the southern islands in
                            order to:</p>
                        <p>a. Combat existing banditry, lawlessness, and smuggling.</p>
                        <p>b. Prepare the Government of the Philippines to combat the real and
                            active subversive threats to the southern Philippines from
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>3. The study recommends:</p>
                        <p>a. A reorientation of the Philippine Armed Forces to a primary mission
                            involving counterinsurgency and law enforcement within the context of
                            the over-all American security system in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>b. That the Philippine military posture should now embrace new measures
                            designed to meet the threat of subversive insurgency in the southern
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur with the basic concepts contained in
                            the study; however, the study envisions a Military Assistance Program
                                (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>) of approximately $35 million
                            in excess of the current FY 1966–1970 program. Therefore, priorities
                            have been established in the Annex to Appendix B which show those items
                            of equipment selected as the most essential (based on a $10 million
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> increase and spread over five
                            years). These data and the <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            study have previously been made available to the Chief, Joint US
                            Military Advisory Group, Philippines.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that the views of the
                            Country Team in Manila should be obtained regarding the study prior to
                            initiating conversations on the subject with Philippine officials. They
                            are also of the opinion that any increase in US assistance which may <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0709"/>be required to shift the
                            Philippine military defenses to the southern islands should be made
                            contingent upon:</p>
                        <p>a. Reorientation of the Philippine Armed Forces and paramilitary
                            establishments, as necessary, to a primary mission involving
                            counter-insurgency operations.</p>
                        <p>b. An increase in the Philippine military budget.</p>
                        <p>c. Securing an arrangement with the Philippine Government whereby any new
                            facilities constructed with US assistance in the southern Philippines
                            would be available to the United States on a joint use basis.</p>
                        <p>d. Availability of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds in excess of
                            current and projected world-wide programs.</p>
                        <p>6. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. A memorandum, substantially as contained in Appendix A, together with
                            the study contained in Appendix B, its Annex, and the proposed

                            in Appendix C, be forwarded to the Secretary of State requesting his
                            concurrence.</p>
                        <p>b. Upon receipt of concurrence from the Department of State, the proposed
                                State-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-Defense message contained
                            in Appendix C be dispatched to the American Embassy in Manila.<note n="5" xml:id="d304fn5">According to a memorandum from Vance to the

                        </list>
                        <p>This is in response to your request to assess the problems in obtaining a
                            substantial (“3–4 division”) Philippine force for Vietnam—particularly
                            as these problems relate to the President's role.</p>
                        <p>Until two weeks ago, two basic difficulties held up any additional
                            manpower contribution: financial arrangements and political
                            considerations. After several months of negotiations, we have arrived at
                            financial arrangements satisfactory to both the Philippine Government
                            and ourselves. Although these arrangements apply specifically to the
                            34-man civic action team, both State and our Embassy are confident that
                            the precedent will hold for the proposed 2,000-man military Task Force
                            and for any larger force that might be sent.</p>
                        <p>The political problems pose a more serious obstacle. They relate to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s election prospects
                            and his need to obtain congressional approval for sending troops abroad.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s interest in
                            sending troops and his leverage on Congress have been weakened by the
                            deteriorating situation in South Vietnam and by pressures for
                            negotiations both in the US and abroad. There has also been concern that
                            the US will concentrate on fighting from the air and leave the ground
                            war to others—specifically, to Asians. However, our air strikes and the
                            landing of the Marines have had some salutary effects.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances, there are no specific US actions which would
                            guarantee the sending of a 2,000-man Task Force, to say nothing of a
                            much larger element. There are two channels of approach, however, which
                            might be helpful:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Vietnam Policy:</hi> Actions that convince <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> in particular and the
                            Filipinos in general of our determination to stay with the fight in
                            Vietnam would allay fears that the Philippine forces might be left out
                            on a limb. For example:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">A Presidential letter</hi> to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> detailing our present thinking
                            on Vietnam, our resolve, and the role to be played by Filipino
                            troops;</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0711"/>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">More US ground forces</hi> in South Vietnam, thereby
                            removing grounds for the contention that we are relying largely on
                            airpower and are not exposing our own troops.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Philippine Domestic Affairs:</hi> US actions which
                            directly or indirectly have the effect of strengthening <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s bid for re-election would
                            increase his willingness to risk the loss of some votes by pressing the
                            proposal to commit troops to Vietnam. While such US actions would
                            broaden his appeal in the provinces, they would tend to set up severe
                            counter-pressures in the Manila area, in the press, and among opposition
                            politicians whose support will be needed to gain approval of the Vietnam
                            venture.</p>
                        <p>The following possible steps are listed in ascending order of their
                            effectiveness in gaining the Philippine contribution (and in ascending
                            order of identification with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>):</p>
                        <p>a. Early resolution of outstanding <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            negotiations (rice and meat) on terms favorable to the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. (We are now moving on the rice.)</p>
                        <p>b. Resolution of sources of friction that derive from our military bases.
                            We are presently making progress on the criminal jurisdiction article.
                            Conciliation of other issues would be translated into political gains

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName>'s request for an
                            appointment with you comes at a good time for a strong push by you to
                            get Philippine Congressional approval of a 2,000-man Task Force of
                            engineers for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador will give you two letters from President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>:<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">Dated May 13 and April 29, respectively. (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Philippines, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> Correspondence, 12/63–12/65)</note> one on
                            sugar legislation (which you need only acknowledge, saying that we will
                            give this matter study; <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName>
                            expects no discussion on sugar), the other a brief note of thanks for
                            sending Ambassador Lodge to the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The second letter provides the point of departure for a discussion of the
                            Task Force.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> offered such a force
                            during his State Visit last October. Since then, after prolonged
                            negotiations, we have come close to our goal: We have worked out a
                            covert U.S. financing arrangement (Note: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName> does not know about this
                            arrangement and should not know); and the Philippine House of
                            Representatives has approved the proposal for the Task Force by a large
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>Chief stumbling block now is the Philippine Senate, which is controlled
                            by the Nacionalista Party, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s opponents in a tough election year. Here we
                            can achieve success only through bi-partisan support for the measure;
                            yet the Nacionalista leadership is so far opposed. (<persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> needs 13 votes and is sure of
                            only 10.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Ledesma</persName> can help to
                            provide a solution: he is not only a well-respected businessman and very
                            pro-American; he is also a life-long member of the opposition
                            Nacionalista Party. An appeal to him can <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0713"/>therefore carry weight not only with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, but with his own party and
                            its representatives in the Senate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. You recall with great warmth <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s support for our Vietnam policies last
                            October and his statement that Filipinos, as Asians, could make an
                            important military and psychological contribution in Vietnam. (We are
                            grateful for the 73 Filipinos—in medical civic action and psychological
                            warfare—already in Vietnam.)</p>
                        <p>2. You understand <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s
                            desire for Congressional approval of the 2,000-man Task Force.</p>
                        <p>3. You can assure the Ambassador of our total determination to stay with
                            the job in Vietnam; our determination has been demonstrated anew in our
                            actions since January.</p>
                        <p>4. You are convinced that early dispatch of the Task Force would hearten
                            the South Vietnamese people, convey a strong warning to the Communists,
                            and disprove American critics who claim that our Vietnam policies lack
                            Asian support.</p>
                        <p>5. You request that the Ambassador, both as <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s representative and as a respected member of
                            the opposition party, use his influence with both parties in Manila in
                            order to promote bi-partisan support for the Task Force. You understand
                            the difficulties of an election year and a divided Congress; but the
                            need for such a Task Force clearly transcends party rivalries in view of
                            the challenge which confronts us all in Southeast Asia.</p>

                            have been agreed in principle for so long between us. He has now
                            proposed instead that the Filipinos send volunteers and that we pay for

                            they want, and call them volunteers, and this is a lousy precedent in
                            the face of what the Chinese have threatened.</p>

                                the Philippine Congress to pass a Vietnam bill. Hechanova stated
                                that he did not understand the U.S. opposition to the volunteer
                                concept. (Ibid.)</note> In light of recent developments we believe
                            it necessary to recognize that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will not recertify aid to Viet-Nam bill, and
                            that further efforts by us to persuade him to do so will be
                            unproductive. We believe it desirable, therefore, to terminate
                            discussions to this end with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and other Philippine leaders. We would like to
                            do this with as little contention as possible both because we will be
                            needing cooperative atmosphere in Manila during next few months as
                            Viet-Nam conflict develops and in order not to prejudice what we regard
                            as rather slim chance that he will take action after election.</p>
                        <p>Objectives should be to accept present situation, to keep door open for
                            change in <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position after elections,
                            and to have <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> feeling he
                            owes us something and inclined to cooperate with us wherever he can.</p>
                        <p>We think there are some advantages in using indirect but reliable channel
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> for some if not all
                            of our reaction, but we leave decision in this regard in your hands.

                                that the proposal for volunteers was both “unacceptable and

                        <p>66. I saw President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> this
                            evening and conveyed to him in detail contents of Deptel 36.<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">
                                <ref target="#d308">Document 308</ref>.</note> I emphasized several
                            times that Washington was both gravely concerned and disappointed that
                            the Vietnam bill had not been pressed. When I had finished the President
                            said that he had further discussions with party leaders since our
                            earlier talks and they had unanimously agreed that it was best to
                            postpone action until after the elections. He reiterated the reasons he
                            had earlier given and assured me that a minimum of one million pesos
                            would be made available to keep the two medical and civic action teams
                            in Vietnam for another year. I told the President that in all frankness
                            I must tell him that I was not convinced that if a determined and
                            bipartisan effort had been made to pass the Vietnam bill it would have
                            passed in close to its present form. The President told me that if the
                            Nacionalistas had been sincere in their desire to support meaningful aid
                            to Vietnam <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0717"/>they would have
                            supported the administration's bill. This bill, he said, provided
                            precisely the kind of aid the Government of Vietnam had requested. The
                            President said, “I think I know the Nacionalistas and their motives.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is no leader and he
                            will do what the Lopezes tell him to do.” He continued, “If I win, and I
                            am increasingly certain that I will win, I promise, and you can tell
                            Washington this, that I will call a special session of Congress on
                            November 15. If I win by a large majority, I will ask for more than what
                            the present bill calls for (i.e. a battalion of engineers plus security
                            forces). I agreed with Senator Manahan that in addition to this we
                            should send more civic action teams. We need the experience, and if
                            trouble develops with Indonesia we will have to fight the kind of war
                            which is now being fought in Vietnam.” “I hope Washington will
                            understand,” he said, “that I am sincere; that ever since I was first
                            heard of, I have been known as a friend of democracy and particularly of
                            the US. If the bill I presented had been watered down, the image of the
                            Philippines would have been impaired.” I interrupted to tell the
                            President that I felt the reputation of the Philippines would be
                            impaired in any event once it became known that the bill which his
                            administration had publicly and enthusiastically proposed was not going
                            to be approved. The President said that he believed that anyone who
                            understood the workings of democratic governments would appreciate that
                            there are many things that can not be accomplished in the final frenzy
                            of a political campaign. In conclusion, the President said with apparent
                            feeling that he hoped Washington would understand that all that was
                            involved was a temporary delay—less than four months—and that he would
                            still fulfill his commitment. I told the President that we had no
                            alternative but to accept his decision but that the next few months
                            might well be the tough and crucial months—that the US had been carrying
                            a disproportionate share of the burden—that we had reason to believe we
                            could count on the Philippines for meaningful assistance, but that this
                            help had not materialized.</p>
                        <p>The President assured me this help would be forthcoming and asked again
                            for understanding of the circumstances which had made impossible at this
                            time passage of the administration's bill.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I have asked the good offices of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LO1">Oscar Ledesma</persName> to hand you this letter on Philippine
                            assistance to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Filipino people and my Administration support the continuing U.S.
                            commitment in the struggle for freedom in Vietnam as a clear proof of
                            American sincerity and interest in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>On our part, we shall endeavor to maintain our contribution to freedom in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Last year, the Philippine Congress approved a national policy of helping
                            in the struggle for freedom in Vietnam by the sending of technical aid
                            and personnel to that country and, for which, the Philippine Congress
                            appropriated the amount of peso 1-million.</p>
                        <p>This year, in our effort to increase our contribution, I sent to our
                            Congress a special message asking for peso 25-million to enable us to
                            increase and broaden our efforts in the form of an engineer battalion
                            with security support made up of 2,000 officers and men. In the closing
                            days of the regular session of Congress, I again expressed my interest
                            in the bill by certifying it to our Congress as urgent. Unfortunately,
                            this bill did not pass Congress in its regular session because of the
                            dominant position of the Opposition leaders; neither was the national
                            budget, so absolutely essential to the conduct of government,
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the composition of our Congress today and the partisan
                            atmosphere prevailing therein have made it difficult, if not
                            impracticable, to secure at this time the necessary authority for the
                            Philippine engineer battalion to Vietnam. The deadlock between the
                            Opposition-dominated Senate and the President is a novel situation in
                            our political experience as part of the growing pains of our
                            democracy.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the primary issues of the current presidential election
                            campaign, and it is this issue which I trust our people will resolve not
                            only by investing my humble person with a continuing mandate, but also
                            by granting me the necessary legislative support in both chambers of our
                            Congress to enable me to achieve my goals. I therefore look forward to
                            the fruitful outcome of the elections come November and the consequent
                            resolution of this deadlock by our people once and for all.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>It is our purpose that even before the new Congress convenes in January,
                            1966, we shall summon it to a special session at the end of November to
                            ask, among other things, for the necessary authority to increase and
                            broaden the Philippine commitment in the current struggle for freedom in
                            Vietnam, if possible beyond the engineer battalion.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, we have hopes of projecting the Philippine commitment in
                            Vietnam. Even in the absence of the necessary appropriations for
                            continuing funds from the Opposition-dominated Philippine Congress, I
                            have directed that our present contingent in Vietnam be maintained.</p>
                        <p>My conviction that South Vietnam should be supported by freedom-loving
                            peoples from falling to the communists needs no reiteration. I am
                            certain that the Filipino people themselves share and support this
                            policy. The project to increase our participation in the democratic
                            effort in Vietnam has suffered some delay because of the exigencies of
                            the presidential election, but I am confident that after the Filipino
                            political leaders have emerged from their absorption in the current
                            electoral struggle, with our expected victory, the increased
                            participation of our country, side by side with our American allies, in
                            the struggle for human freedom in Vietnam shall proceed with the
                            resounding support of the Filipino people.</p>
                        <p>The Filipino people share the gratification of other free Asian nations
                            over the firm resolve of your Administration to overcome the communist
                            aggression in South Vietnam. Our people and I personally pray for your
                            success and wish you to know that you are not alone in your great and
                            noble endeavor. All free men the world over are behind you.</p>

                            lines:</p>
                        <p>a. “I deeply appreciated your thoughtfulness in apprising me personally
                            of the factors underlying your decision to postpone further efforts to
                            gain legislative approval for a Philippine engineer battalion to serve
                            in Viet-Nam. I am most heartened by your resolution to again seek
                            authority from the Philippine Congress for the battalion, and your
                            decision that the present contingent will remain. As I have written in
                            the past, your support of Free World efforts in South Viet-Nam is of
                            signal importance to us and to the Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>b. “In respect to our common struggle in Viet-Nam, I hope that you will
                            bear with us in a matter which directly affects our mutual interests.
                            Sudden and urgent need has arisen in Viet-Nam for massive supplies of
                            rice to areas temporarily cut off by enemy action from the growing
                            regions. This emergency, unforeseen and highly critical, complicated by
                            our current shipping difficulties, may result in delayed shipments of
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 rice to the Philippines. We
                            will, of course, strive to fulfill our rice commitment with all possible
                            speed.</p>
                        <p>c. “In closing, let me say how moved I was by your personal expressions
                            of support and good wishes. It is my purpose that America's example in
                            the current struggle will prove worthy of your sentiments.”</p>
                        <p>3. If you believe allusion to rice problem in this context undesirable,
                            para 2b above could be omitted. Request reply soonest.<note n="3" xml:id="d311fn3">In telegram 406 from Manila, August 27, the Embassy
                                stated that it believed that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> would view these two issues in a single
                                letter as “a veiled threat to withhold rice if troops not produced,
                                or possibly a warning that we intended to withhold rice in
                                retaliation for failure to send troops thus far.” The Embassy noted
                                that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> was involved in
                                an uncertain election campaign and “fighting hard battle for his
                                political future.” In such a highly charged political atmosphere, he
                                might see the issues of troops for Vietnam and P.L. 480 rice only in
                                terms of Philippine domestic policies. The Embassy suggested
                                dropping the issue of rice from the response and trying to work out
                                a compromise on rice shipments with lower level Philippine
                                officials. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

                        <p>Dear <persName>John</persName>:</p>
                        <p>A.I.D. is in agreement with Mr. Hoopes that the principal aim of our
                            assistance to the Philippines should be toward internal security. We
                            also agree with the proposal that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            should be oriented to give greater emphasis to internal security and
                            that very serious efforts should be made to bring the Government of the
                            Philippines to this conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Enclosed is a paper on “Internal Civil Security in the Philippines”<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> which was
                            prepared pursuant to our discussions during the recent review of Mr.
                            Hoopes' study.<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">Townsend Hoopes' study,
                                summarized briefly in the preceding paragraph, has not been
                                found.</note> This paper addresses the Philippine internal civil
                            security capability and U.S. assistance in the face of a generalized
                            situation of rising violence and lawlessness which is impeding economic
                            and social development and constitutes a potential basic threat to the
                            stability of the government.</p>
                        <p>The Philippine Constabulary (<gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>), a
                            Philippine Department of Defense agency, is a major internal civil
                            security element which has as its primary function the police duty of
                            preserving peace, law and order. However, the <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> lacks suitable equipment, adequate training, and
                            appropriate direction and orientation to carry out this duty.
                            Furthermore the <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> is not now receiving
                            and, under present plans, will not receive required U.S. assistance in
                            terms of technical advice, training, or material consistent with its
                            primary role. Although it represents about half the Philippine
                            Department of Defense forces, it receives less than 10 per cent of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds for the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Other potentially important elements in the Philippine law enforcement
                            (internal civil security) structure are the nearly 1,400 city and
                            municipal police forces. Currently, they are inadequately supported,
                            their equipment and facilities are poor, pay is below subsistence
                            levels, <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0722"/>and political
                            interference is rife. However, little or no U.S. assistance is now being
                            provided or planned for these police forces.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that (1) there are serious deficiencies in these very large
                            and most important parts of the Philippine law enforcement structure
                            which together constitute the rural civil security forces in the
                            Philippines, and that (2) these parts of the law enforcement structure
                            have not received and, under present plans, will not receive required
                            assistance. As expressed in the National Policy Paper on the Republic of
                            the Philippines, now circulating for final clearance, it seems clear
                            that correcting these deficiencies is very much in the U.S. interest and
                            would be in keeping with U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>We believe that greater U.S. assistance, by both A.I.D. and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is essential. We propose that A.I.D.
                            and the Department of Defense, with appropriate Department of State
                            consultation, and later the Country Team, jointly prepare terms of
                            reference for discussing this matter with the Government of the
                            Philippines. Briefly, our views are that the Philippine Government
                            should provide substantially increased support and improved leadership
                            for its police forces, and that the United States should offer
                            substantially more police assistance through the A.I.D. Public Safety
                            Program, especially to the Philippine Constabulary. U.S. technical
                            police assistance and police training to the various law enforcement
                            agencies would be centralized under the A.I.D. Public Safety Program. At
                            the same time, commodity assistance to the Philippine Constabulary could
                            be divided, if desired, between A.I.D. and the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> providing
                            military-type equipment and A.I.D. providing police equipment.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary to these basic improvements, we expect to be discussing
                            with the U.S. A.I.D. Mission the contribution to internal security goals
                            which can be made by improvement in other A.I.D. fields. We believe that
                            there is potential in Public Administration, Food for Peace, the
                            utilization of development loans, possible expansion of the Service
                            Training Center, and the possible development of a barrio digest.</p>

                            have reciprocated by maintaining legislative records consistently in

                        <p>In brief, $28 million in War Damage funds have been set aside in the U.S.
                            Treasury as a “Special Fund for Education”, to be used to the mutual
                            advantage of the Philippines and the United States. State now <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0725"/>asks that you authorize
                            negotiations with the Philippine Government on the uses of this Special
                            Fund.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the Filipinos came forward last year with a proposal that a
                            portion of this money be devoted to a Land Reform Education program in
                            connection with the implementation of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s Land Reform Code of 1962.<note n="5" xml:id="d314fn5">See <ref target="#d300">Document 300</ref>.</note>
                            State also asks that you authorize conclusion of an agreement committing
                            us to the support of this program for Land Reform Education through
                            disbursements from the Special Fund for Education.</p>
                        <p>These War Damage funds have had a difficult legislative history and have
                            previously caused deep irritations between our two countries (<persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> cancelled his 1962 State Visit
                            in pique over Congress's failure to pass the War Damage Bill). So our
                            first objective should be to move without unnecessary delay on the uses
                            of the money now that the funds are available. At the same time, we
                            should do all we can to ensure that these funds go to solid, viable
                            projects that can contribute effectively to the Filipino development
                            process. State's terms of reference provide for project-by-project
                            review by Embassy Manila and the relevant U.S. agencies; no funds will
                            be moved from the Treasury until a particular project has been approved;
                            and the Filipinos will issue periodic reports to us on the progress of
                            each project.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is a current political angle that we should keep in mind:
                            the Philippine Presidential elections in November. State intends to move
                            with sufficiently “deliberate speed” to avoid any charges, on the one
                            hand, that we are providing goodies for <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> to announce on election-eve, and on the other
                            hand, that we are pulling the rug on our commitment to him and thereby
                            supporting his opponent. As matters now stand, it is unlikely that any
                            funds will be actually disbursed to the Philippines before the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>State's package makes sense in delivering on a firm U.S. commitment in
                            the context of adequate safeguards. We recommend that you approve the
                            two authorizations.<note n="6" xml:id="d314fn6">A note on the memorandum

                                Elections,” the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> described the
                                election campaign, the candidates, and the issues and concluded that
                                as all three Presidential candidates were “Western oriented and
                                pledge to continue close ties with the US and the West.” The
                                significance of the elections lay “not so much in who wins, but in
                                whether the winner institutes and pursues a basic socioeconomic
                                reform program. Without reforms, generalized public discontent is
                                likely to increase and the small leftist element in the Philippines
                                will probably grow.” (Johnson Library, National Security File,
                                Country File, Philippines, Vol. II, 6/64–6/66, [1 of 2])</note>
                            reveals one basic factor (and virtually no others with any certainty),
                            which is that the elections, at this time, are extremely close.
                            Prospects are they will remain close right up to the vote on 9 November.
                            Although manipulation of elections in the Philippines is by no means a
                            new phenomenon, this basic factor, together with other factors which
                            tend to enhance its importance, renders the current elections of much
                            greater interest than is normal, particularly in terms of the various
                            methods to improve their respective positions which either side may
                            resort to. The elections methods employed and the results, especially if
                            close, can be expected to aggravate an already tense situation, in the
                            time remaining prior to, during, and especially, after the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>2. Some concern has been expressed that if the initial returns are close
                            and subsequent returns do not produce a decisive advantage for one side
                            or the other, a tense situation may develop, with each camp apprehensive
                            that the other may resort to violence to achieve victory. Against this
                            concern it must, however, be noted that the Filipinos have a tendency to
                            over-dramatize situations, and that there can be a gap between
                            threatening words and actual deeds, with potentially explosive
                            situations being resolved peacefully despite the show of force which
                            seems called for out of considerations of pride and prestige. The
                            Embassy is preparing a separate report on this aspect of the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>3. At least two other factors give some reason for concern over the
                            elections in general. This is the first time the Filipinos have
                            conducted an election without the direct and at least to some extent,
                            steadying influence of United States involvement; they are on their own
                            and they may be expected to indulge in many more manipulatory tactics
                            than in <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0727"/>previous elections
                            since 1949. The other factor of some importance is the Filipino voters'
                            exposure in the provinces and down to the barrio level to more
                            sophisticated mass political media of virtually every type. The effect
                            of mass media on the average Filipino voter is an unknown quantity, but
                            in making the voter himself more sophisticated, however basically good
                            the process, the probable course of the elections becomes even more
                            difficult to interpret.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“The Third Force”</p>
                        <p>It is generally conceded that Manglapus of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> has no chance. Little attention is being given to him,
                            although his down-the-line reform stand has gone over well. Manglapus'
                            strength varies widely in reporting, anywhere from two to seventeen
                            percent. There is no clear data as to whom he has harmed or helped; most
                            observers feel this scale would be about equal. Nevertheless, the
                            outcome of Manglapus, and the rest of the <gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss> candidates, is worth watching due to the demonstrated
                            appeal during the elections campaign to younger elements in the voting
                            public and as a possible gauge to the future of reform movement in the
                            country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vote Prognostications</p>
                        <p>1. One month prior to the elections, both camps claim ultimate victory;
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by a margin of from
                            360,000 to 400,000 votes; <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            exact plurality claim is not known. All available information at this
                            time indicates that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            leading nationally by from three to five percent. Results of the most
                            recent national Robot-Gallup poll conducted during 10–28 September were
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>—39 percent</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>—43 percent</p>
                        <p>Senator Manglapus—9 percent</p>
                        <p>Don't know or refused to answer—9 percent</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> lead, because of its
                            slender nature, thus raises the distinct probability of increased
                            manipulation tactics by both sides: <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to increase his slim lead substantially; and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> not only to catch
                            up, but to greatly strengthen his position to one of as little concern
                            as possible prior to the elections. It is perhaps academic to note that
                            the incumbent has by far superior manipulatory capability than has his
                            opponent, at least if the opponent's position does not become so strong
                            as to become irreversible.</p>
                        <p>2. Registered voters in the Philippines number somewhere between seven
                            and nine million, with slightly over seven and one half million being
                            the usual figure quoted. It is generally reported that in order to win
                            an opposition candidate must have a lead of from eight <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0728"/>to ten percent going into the
                            elections, mainly to take up the slack of expected vote frauds by the
                            incumbent, which, for unclear reasons, can be expected to range between
                            500,000 and one million votes—any higher figure being considered too
                            dangerous. However questionable such figures may be, the fact remains
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in order to win, and
                            short of a landslide, should have a lead of about ten percent over
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>; a lead which he
                            does not now have and probably cannot attain in the face of pressures
                            and capabilities <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> can
                            mount before 9 November.</p>
                        <p>3. An <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> official's estimate as of 1
                            October covering provinces and cities is of considerable interest,
                            particularly since the findings are within .2 percent nationally of
                            other and more recent polls, and since the same official accurately
                            predicted the 1961 results. The official in question is an associate of
                            Speaker Pro Tem Pendatun. A brief summary of his estimates follows:</p>
                        <p>Nationally—<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would receive
                            3,942,391 to 3,630,297 for <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, or a margin of 312,094.</p>
                        <p>Provinces—<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> 3,359,226 to
                            3,067,085 for <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>; a margin
                            of 292,141 for <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> (Northern
                            Luzon to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> by 165,660;
                            Central Luzon to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by
                            17,205; Southern Tagalog to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            by 149,206; Bicol to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by

                            by 42,244; Western Visayas to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> by 18,637; and Mindanao to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by 55,225).</p>
                        <p>Cities—<persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> would receive in
                            the major cities 124,945 to 110,651 for <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, a margin of 14,294 (Luzon to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> by 50,891; Visayas to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by 16,644; and Mindanao to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> by 14,294).</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> Executive Committee, as of 10
                            October had <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> winning by a
                            margin of 360,000. Prognosis was that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> would lose Ilocandia by 200,000; Manila by
                            60,000; Northern Luzon by 40,000, but win Central Luzon by 170,000,
                            Southern Tagalog by 10,000; Bicol by 40,000; Mindanao by 300,000; and
                            the Visayas by 100,000.</p>
                        <p>5. A Police Constabulary poll of 10 October found that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> would win the election by a
                            margin of 260,000 to 400,000. It is probable that this poll is the basis
                            for current <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> figures in the
                            elections.</p>

                        <p>1. Given past experience both sides will undoubtedly engage in widespread
                            manipulation tactics, including vote frauds, subversion of election
                            officials, stuffing of ballot boxes, votes lost through managed
                            counting, etc. In addition, both sides will use every other means at
                            their disposal to improve their own position. In this context, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> has a clear edge, largely due
                            to the fact that as the incumbent he has a far greater capability. In
                            the past, the <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> and especially the
                                <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> have figured prominently in
                            elections to the advantage of the party in power. Although the <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> have assured the <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> that
                            there is no <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0729"/>intention of using
                            either in the current elections, it is already apparent this is not the
                            case. The <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> is involved in conducting
                            polls on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and
                            despite the fact that Malacanang claims otherwise the transfer of some
                            eleven PC officials from areas of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> strength in the North to safe areas in the South
                            at this time indicates some degree of political overtone. Minister of
                            Defense Peralta stated to the US Charge d'Affaires some time ago that he
                            would utilize every means at his disposal if necessary. Regarding the
                                <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss>, however, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> can be expected to exercise
                            some caution, since <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            popular with the military, the majority of whom are Iloconos from the
                            North. Reports also indicate that the government plans to take many
                            popular measures, including tax amnesty, distribution of much needed
                            rice in various regions just prior to the elections, etc., and can
                            probably find many other ways to improve the government's image in such
                            a way as to have considerable impact before 9 November.</p>
                        <p>2. Regardless of his seemingly better position in terms of manipulation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> nevertheless has
                            problems. Although he has already used virtually every legal and illegal
                            means to acquire and distribute funds, information indicates there is a
                            serious shortage of money; at least money in the quantity <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may feel is required in the
                            remaining weeks. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> must
                            also make every effort to keep various important supporters behind him,
                            especially in the face of an increase in <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' lead, which would carry with it a bandwagon
                            reaction. A case in point would be a switch by Pendatun, which in turn
                            would threaten the <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            stronghold in Mindanao. The position of the bloc-voting INK, which
                            claims to be able to deliver between 200,000 and 800,000 votes, is
                            apparently not yet fixed. Latest information from <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> sources claim the INK will back <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> (and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s running mate Roxas), but there is no
                            certainty that Bishop Manolo of the INK may not opportunistically switch
                            at the last moment. There is little doubt that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> is concerned. Both <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss>
                            highlevel sources report that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will have 400,000 fraudulent votes in
                            Cotabato, Surigao, North and South Lanao (all in Mindanao), Cebu, and
                            Iloilo. The same sources claim the <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss>
                            will have 100,000 fraudulent votes, but no specific region is known.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Trouble and Violence</p>
                        <p>1. Tension is clearly rising as we enter the last two weeks of election,
                            and tension will continue until the final results are known and
                            accepted. The candidates themselves contribute to fears of violence by
                            charges that opponents are resorting to violent tactics or threatening
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> alleges <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has threatened to shoot <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> in the event of an <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> victory, and that a “select group” of
                            Nacionalistas have hatched a plan for post election trouble. In view of
                            Peralta's statements to the Charge d'Affaires that he would do whatever
                            was <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0730"/>necessary, and in view of
                            Liberal Party intentions as expressed to Embassy officers of
                            manipulating returns in Mindanao, the <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> charges may be a smoke screen to hide his own
                            post election intentions.</p>
                        <p>2. The Nacionalistas are not in a position where they can foment violence
                            or trouble that could not be dealt with by the Constabulary and the
                            Army. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s capability in
                            fomenting disorder is limited only by pro-<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> sentiment within the <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> officer corps. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> on the other hand could obtain a more sympathetic
                            hearing from the Senate. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            has also made a campaign issue of his respect for the Supreme Court in
                            contrast to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s constant
                            rebuffs by the High Court. It would appear likely that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will take his protests, if any,
                            through the Senate and the Courts. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s most practical recourse is through
                            manipulation and force majeure.</p>
                        <p>3. Possible post election difficulties might take one or more of the

                        <p>1. In the event of an early <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> lead, the <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss>
                            would scour the country for evidence of fraud and manipulation which
                            they could utilize for contesting the election in the courts or
                            justifying a refusal to certify results by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>2. Publicity given to <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> proof of fraud,
                            legitimate or manufactured, might well inspire protest rallies which
                            could lead to civil dis- turbances and to further breakdown of law and
                            order.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Liberals</p>
                        <p>1. Unnecessary deputizing of the Constabulary and their pro-
                            administration activities could lead to clashes with local government
                            and police.</p>
                        <p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was leading in the
                            early returns, an all out effort might be made to ensure that
                            appropriate late returns from “the birds and trees” of Mindanao would
                            ensure a <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> victory.</p>
                        <p>3. Civil disturbances might result if the administration suspended
                            election reporting by the Philippine Jay Cees and the Philippine News
                            Service in an effort to avoid obvious contradictions in election
                            results.</p>
                        <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> imposed Martial Law
                            to ensure blatantly fraudulent returns or to counter post election moves
                            by the <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss>, pro-<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> sentiment within the Armed Forces could even
                            crystallize into a coup d'etat in favor of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Calling in the military either by Martial Law or extensive deputizing
                            of the Constabulary would only result in a further deterioration of
                            normal law and order in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>C. In the event of a closely contested election, which is certain to
                            occasion flagrant vote manipulation by the administration, a growing
                            disillusionment with the democratic process would probably develop. <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0731"/>The electorate would become
                            increasingly vulnerable to the appeal of radical alternatives.</p>
                        <p>4. Despite growing talk of violence and manipulation, the Philippines is
                            generally expected to maintain its reputation for generally orderly and
                            relatively honest elections. General Rigoberto Atienza and Brig General
                            Flaviano Olivares, Armed Forces and <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>
                            chiefs, respectively, have pledged honest and orderly elections in a
                            direct meeting with the President of the Nacionalistas Party. However,
                            in view of the probable closeness of the election, the possibility of
                            post election trouble should not be underestimated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Pyrrhic Victory?</p>
                        <p>In the final analysis, and ruling out a bandwagon sweep for <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in the last weeks, which seems
                            doubtful, <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> may be
                            expected to win the elections. This is not to say that <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> will ever feel secure enough
                            not to utilize to the fullest all means at his disposal, which in turn
                            could inevitably increase the tension in the Philippines to the breaking
                            point, during and/or after the elections if the results are close.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> probably does not have
                            the capability to match <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            and the machine. Regardless of a <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> win, the Philippines as such, and specifically
                            the Filipinos, stand to gain very little indeed. Interesting as the
                            current elections may be, the principal fact which they point up is a
                            continued deterioration in the Philippines situation. The elections
                            serve to aggravate and perhaps make more readable that situation; there
                            is little chance the results will improve it.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The race for President</hi>, opposing Senate
                            President Ferdinand <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            (Nacionalista) to incumbent President Diosdado <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> (Liberal), is extremely close,
                            with the victory margin unlikely to be over 2 to 400,000 votes (3 to 6
                            percent) of a total expected vote of some 7–7.5 million. (The
                            third-party candidate, Raoul Manglapus (Progressive) is given no real
                            chance of victory, though he may poll close to 20 percent of the total
                            vote.) There is thus a distinct possibility of strong contest of the
                            results by the defeated candidate, and of delay in his concession. Even
                            though there are chances of scattered and perhaps some serious violence
                            and disorder, we believe on balance that the contest will be by and
                            large settled peacefully and probably within a period of one to three
                            weeks after the elections.</p>
                        <p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> is re-elected, we
                            can expect him promptly to call a special congressional session to enact
                            the bill to send an engineer task force of some 2500, including security
                            elements, to Viet-Nam. We can also expect continuation of the basically
                            cooperative Philippine attitude in response to our various requests for
                            expanded use of US bases and facilities in support of the Viet-Nam war
                            effort. (For example, we are rapidly building up an important US Air
                            Force facility at Mactan Island, Cebu, on the basis of a combined use
                            arrangement with the Philippine Air Force.) We can further expect to
                            move forward with reasonable speed in the elimination of so-called
                            irritants (military and economic) in US-Philippine relations, and to
                            continue to find the Philippines solidly aligned with Free World
                            purposes and objectives. On the other hand, it is not likely that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, in his second
                            administration, will make significantly more progress in terms of
                            urgently needed programs of internal development than he did in his
                            first. Internal problems in the Philippines might, consequently, become
                            very acute in the not too distant future.</p>
                        <p>3. If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wins the Presidency,
                            we will first of all have a difficult lame-duck period of some two
                            months before his inauguration (December 30).<pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0733"/> It is unlikely that we could make much progress on aid
                            to Viet-Nam during that period, although it could be used to bring
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and those likely to
                            emerge as his closest associates more fully aboard than they are now on
                            this question. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> can be
                            expected to be generally cooperative in seeking solutions to current
                            Philippine-American problems, and to continue basic Philippine
                            orientation toward Free World purposes and objectives. Nationalist
                            elements around <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, however,
                            are likely to make a strong bid for influence in the event of his
                            victory. We might therefore have more difficulties than we would with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> on foreign policy.
                            On the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and the
                            group around him might be more dynamic and effective in moving the
                            country forward internally.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Vice Presidential election</hi> will probably be
                            won by Senator Gerardo Roxas (Liberal), as against his opponents,
                            Senator Fernando Lopez (Nacionalista) and Manuel Manahan (Progressive).
                            The possibility of a <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>-Roxas
                            Administration therefore distinctly exists. If elected, Roxas might
                            emerge as Foreign Secretary under either <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, but the prospect is uncertain. Roxas is an
                            honest and able younger politician and his probable victory is to be
                            welcomed.</p>
                        <p>5. Although it is difficult to predict which of the two main parties will
                            control Congress, it is likely that the Liberals will emerge with slight
                            majorities. In any case, enough post-electoral defections to the party
                            of the winning President are likely to occur, to give the latter an
                            opportunity to obtain support for his legislative program if he shows
                            the requisite qualities of leadership and determination. This was not
                            always the case during the last two years of the <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> Administration.</p>
                        <p>6. Whoever wins November 9, it will be most important that we get close
                            to the President-elect and contribute in influencing him to take the
                            steps required both to enhance Free World objectives in the area and for
                            forward movement in solving the Philippines' badly neglected internal
                            problems.</p>

                            Embassy has been deferring comments on what we may expect from new

                            relate only to significance of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> takeover from <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Most basic consideration is probably that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will be unknown quantity in lonely eminence of
                            Presidency. Whereas both <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> prize power, former
                            sometimes appeared inept in its use and unsure what he wished to do with
                            it. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> appears to measure it
                            carefully and to be very sure of uses to which he puts it. Up to now,
                            basic objective of his harnessing power has of course been to gain the
                            Presidency.</p>
                        <p>3. What <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> really believes in,
                            what his goals are, and how he proposes to go about achieving them, are
                            largely matters of conjecture. To some degree, he has been a guerrilla
                            both in war and during the campaign, placing great emphasis on careful
                            planning, systematic intelligence, secrecy, element of surprise and
                            final massive surfacing of his forces at right time. In gaining <gloss target="#t_NP1">NP</gloss> nomination, and in winning Presidency, he
                            displayed remarkable talents in these areas. Now that he has won
                            Presidency, onus will be on him to demonstrate what his basic beliefs
                            and ideas are.</p>
                        <p>4. He comes to power accompanied by somewhat similar high hopes which
                            accompanied <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s accession
                            in 1961, except that electorate, having been disappointed once again,
                            may now be still more cynical. At same time, pressure on <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to produce will be even greater
                            because (1) basic problems of nation have become intensified and (2) he
                            knows he will probably suffer <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s fate in 1969 <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0735"/>unless he does get things moving. Good government may
                            therefore be the best politics for him.</p>
                        <p>5. There are those who assert that era of corruption under Garcia will
                            return in magnified form. A more balanced view would be that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has very considerable
                            potentialities, and that coming years will show whether these
                            potentialities will be exerted for high or sinister purposes. Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> recently observed,
                            as earlier reported, that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            was brilliant but unscrupulous, but that great responsibility might
                            sober him. Secretary of Defense Peralta's comment was that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would double-cross us if he could
                            and that we should not let him put anything over on us.</p>
                        <p>6. The assertion, circulated by <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s propaganda machine and widely disseminated
                            by visiting US newspapermen, that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will be much in debt to ex-Pres Garcia, the Lopez
                            interests, the “nationalists” or any other group, appears questionable.
                            He has of course some political debts to discharge, but because of way
                            in which he figuratively seized Nacionalista nomination and then largely
                            single-handedly won election, he will assume Presidency with fewer
                            political drafts on future than probably any of his predecessors.</p>
                        <p>7. There would appear to be at least some grounds for cautious optimism
                            toward future. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is realist
                            with high awareness of pragmatic and empirical considerations. He weighs
                            and sifts facts carefully, considers numerous angles and acts only after
                            searching consideration and assessment. Once decisions are reached,
                            however, he displays generalship of high order in implementing them.</p>
                        <p>8. Furthermore, there is some evidence that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is more keenly attuned to needs of country than
                            his critics give him credit for. Woeful conditions throughout nation
                            seem to have had considerable impact on him in his extensive travels in
                            past year. His speeches reflected increasing bitterness, in a manner
                            that seemed to be more than merely campaign oratory, at <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> administration's largely
                            ineffectual attempts to improve people's welfare. If theory is correct
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has high absorptive
                            capacity and is greatly influenced by things he is exposed to, then his
                            nationwide observations may serve valuable purpose.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' first preoccupation must
                            inevitably be with domestic affairs in view of facts that government
                            till may be almost empty, that the stability of peso must be defended,
                            and that severe demands are imposed on administration by rapidly growing
                            population. His qualities of decisiveness will promptly be put to test,
                            with some hope that he will get down to deeds rather than words and
                            govern rather than campaign as did <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>. Much will depend on caliber of membership his
                            Cabinet, and extent to which he can make them function as a team.
                            Judging by his past performance, it would seem evident that he <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0736"/>will be the boss in
                            unmistakable fashion. His knowledge of the Legislative branch, based on
                            service in both houses, and his ability to play role of conciliator and
                            find common denominator, may serve him well. His “ruthlessness” may
                            prove useful in that elements tempted to free-wheel under another kind
                            of leadership may be concerned that there will be retaliation if they
                            get out of line. As former long-time Liberal, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has many friends in opposition party and may have
                            some success in gaining their cooperation on basis that nation needs
                            demand bi-partisan approach.</p>
                        <p>10. In foreign affairs <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may
                            be in very different position of feeling his way for some time. Road to
                            Presidency in Philippines is not via international matters, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has accordingly not
                            concentrated on these, even though his reading has probably been
                            extensive. He will probably desist from any personal initiatives until
                            he has first got grip on pressing domestic matters. At same time, he may
                            insist on personal direction of important foreign policy matters,
                            especially where actions involve any change of course from those taken
                            by outgoing government. In military field, he may well act as his own
                            Secretary of Defense and will undoubtedly establish closer relations
                            with military than did <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. Sphere of US-Philippine relations will be highly important to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> as it was to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>. With his sensitivity to power
                            considerations, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is well
                            aware of US influence and role in Philippines and Southeast Asia. His
                            public attitudes now are Phil nationalism has been a balanced one; Phils
                            should not engage in wanton anti-Americanism but should expect to deal
                            with us on basis of mutual respect. (He feels US and Philippines are
                            “mutually dependent.) His emissaries have given encouraging indications
                            of his desire to get off on right foot with us, and we can perhaps
                            expect a goodwill period of some duration, particularly in dealing with
                            matters on which he is less familiar than we are. He is nevertheless an
                            Oriental who sets great store by friendliness, prestige and face, and it
                            will be in our interest to bear this in mind. Impression we make on him
                            in early months both in Washington and Manila will be of considerable
                            significance. We must be prepared for shakedown period which may last as
                            long as one year, and not look too askance at whatever initiatives may
                            be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>12. For his part <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may
                            privately be somewhat apprehensive despite his display of external
                            confidence, hoping that he will succeed in making good impression on us.
                            Although he has not questioned its propriety, he is a trifle sensitive
                            as to the apparent intimacy which President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and his closest associates enjoyed with the
                            US. Since rightly or wrongly he is personally convinced that both on
                            record and in terms of his own attitudes no one is more committed to the
                            US than he, it is in our interest to assure him, as we are doing, of our
                                <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0737"/>friendliness and
                            confidence, particularly in the first few months, when he will be
                            attacking pressing domestic problems. We shall not necessarily receive
                            same 100 percent cooperation we had from <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> in foreign affairs—although initial
                            indications are encouraging—since we shall now be dealing with much
                            stronger personality who may be less compliant at times but who may also
                            be instrumental in creating a stronger Philippines, which is in our
                            interest. By giving <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and his
                            principal advisers maximum exposure to US views and by being as
                            responsive as possible to their approaches, we should have good chance
                            of ensuring that orientation of new administration is largely favorable
                            to US and free world.</p>

                        <p>1. Phil aid to Vietnam. I said to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> this meeting of course not time talk in detail
                            about Phil aid to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, but I did want to
                            convey him utter seriousness of my government's hope that Phils as
                            free-world power and country whose interests vitally at stake would
                            increase assistance to Vietnam. He would undoubtedly want to consult
                            with Phil Congressional leaders about sending specific units or elements
                            and mention these might be premature. My govt hoped however would be

                            aggression Vietnam and his intention do what is necessary and possible
                            that Communism not prevail there. I said US Govt and people would be
                            most favorably impressed if he could do this. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> interjected to say he certainly would. I then
                            said US Govt continues hope that Phils will be able to provide at least
                            engineer task force with <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0738"/>integral security element, indicating another occasion would be proper

                            is due to completion arrangements on immigration and aircraft clearance
                            procedures. I pointed out Manila only one of several <gloss target="#t_RR2">R&amp;R</gloss> sites in Far East. Told him no
                            decision yet about separate <gloss target="#t_RR2">R&amp;R</gloss>
                            program for Seventh Fleet involving perhaps 200 Navy personnel at any
                            given time. I said of course if US strength in Vietnam increases might
                            well be increase in 136 for Phils but not “thousands” to which
                            columnists now referring.</p>
                        <p>This is only subj on which <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            took notes. He wanted know, before I explained, what is holding up
                            initiation of the program, and seemed surprised at small number we
                            propose bring here from Vietnam. He indicated he had no objections to
                                <gloss target="#t_RR2">R&amp;R</gloss> program and made
                            disparaging remarks about press coverage of matter and about Phil press
                            in general.</p>
                        <p>3. Nuclear-powered ships. I told <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> I wanted mention arrangements I had with Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> regarding visits
                            these ships to Subic Bay. Emphasizing tremendous importance of these
                            ships to free-world deterrent power in Far East, and noting visits not
                            frequent, I told him of arrangement under which I informed only Pres
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> or SecDef in advance
                            of arrival. I said if he agreed I propose continue this arrangement,
                            keeping information oral rather than written. I said if he wanted I
                            would give the info also to FonSec and SecDef to be closely held, but
                            not to members of staff those departments.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said he would like me to
                            continue present arrangement and perhaps give it also to SecDef,
                            mentioning at this point that he had not yet decided who would be his
                            Defense Secretary.</p>
                        <p>[1 paragraph (5 lines of source text) not declassified]</p>
                        <p>In closing I invited him visit Enterprise next time it in, perhaps Jan,
                            and he said he hoped very much visit ship but Jan might be <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0739"/>too soon. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> indicated in course this discussion he fully
                            comprehended the significance of these ships for free-world defense in
                            Far East area.</p>
                        <p>4. Base-land relinquishments. I informed <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> we seem to have reached agreement with <gloss target="#t_DFA1">DFA</gloss> on relinquishments agreement and that
                            since we have negotiated it over many months with <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> administration we would be
                            prepared, if present administration wants do so, go ahead and finalize
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> nodded his assent and
                            indicated he had no objection to our signing the agreement before his
                            inauguration. (See septel for his comments to press bearing on this
                            topic and subsequent message to me through <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Ben Romualdez</persName> that he had reconsidered and would like us
                            to drag our feet on this.)<note n="4" xml:id="d319fn4">Not further

                        <p>5. Koreans at Clark Hospital. Referring to large Korean contingent in
                            Vietnam, and US support of these forces including medical assistance, I
                            told him some Koreans being evacuated to Korea through hospital at
                            Clark. Said battle casualties sometimes arrive within hours after being
                            wounded and under circumstances passport and visa formalities obviously
                            not feasible, said knowing humanitarian instincts Phil people I was sure
                            no objection to evacuating Koreans through Clark. I told him that to
                            assist in translation and other matters, a Korean army medical officer
                            is working at Clark Hospital with our people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> indicated he had no
                            objection to this, but said firmly that he preferred we should not talk
                            about the presence of the Koreans at Clark—that we should avoid any
                            publicity on this.</p>
                        <p>6. Tour of US bases. Recognizing he would be extremely busy in next
                            weeks, I said nevertheless our base commanders would be honored if he
                            would visit the bases so that we could brief him about US military
                            activities there. I suggested he might want to take along the FonSec and
                            SecDef and perhaps chairmen of pertinent Congressional committees.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> replied that he would like
                            to do this but was not sure how soon it would be possible because of his
                            busy schedule.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' response on discussion
                            additional commitments South Vietnam strongly encouraging. Providing US
                            can help in equipping at least one engineering construction battalion
                            plus supporting forces, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            virtually assured battalion and supporting forces could be sent. His
                            primary interests are modernization of his armed forces, especially
                            outfitting seven engineering construction battalions, plus using
                            Filipino skilled labor pool for South Vietnam housing needs.</p>
                        <p>I assured <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> our closest
                            cooperation, and that if he had the will we would find the means. He
                            said he has the will and that “we will place ourselves squarely in the
                            fight against Communism.” Believe intensive discussions can commence
                            immediately to work out details. However, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> obviously has ticklish Parliamentary situation in
                            getting authority for combatant forces to South Vietnam through Senate.
                            He appears optimistic and will proceed to seek Congressional
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>I had frank discussion with him regarding importance of maintenance of
                            military equipment. His response was he has been appalled at previous
                            administration's record in this respect and said any equipment will be
                            maintained.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> suggested Philippine
                            housing program for Vietnam. I suggested US will be more interested when
                            Phil more committed to struggle in South Vietnam. Pointed out that Korea
                            had combat division in Viet and thereby had claim on US procurement
                            opportunities. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0741"/>understood. Following meeting
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> PressSec released
                            statement indicating strong consideration being given by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to troop commitment and his plans

                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is strong, confident and
                            competent. Clearly a good bet as a reliable friend of the US and has
                            potential to become strong leader in Asian world. He is responsive to
                            plain friendly direct talk and I would encourage invitation to visit you
                            latter part of 1966.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> and I had very
                            private discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and
                            his FonMin concerning your special instructions regarding bombing, Rome
                            and Warsaw.</p>
                        <p>During visit Manila have stressed importance of Asian friends speaking up
                            on danger of Communist aggression to them. Held such discussions with
                            FonMin Thanat of Thailand and Genl Pham Xuan Chieu of Vietnam's Armed
                            Forces Council.</p>
                        <p>Will prepare more details these and subsequent discussions immediately
                            upon return Washington. Summary of discussions in Taipeh and Seoul will

                            during his inauguration and we hope that you can find a way of setting
                            the press record straight before your departure. We assume <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> himself was eager to join the
                            statement on this subject which appeared after your meeting with him but
                            it is essential here that there be no appearance of crude U.S. pressure
                            now. Moreover what we hope for from <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may be substantially <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0742"/>larger than the items discussed in your conversation
                            with him and it is desired here that there be an open track for very
                            serious talks later.</p>
                        <p>You will know better than we what the exact form of any statement should
                            be. My suggestion is that your farewell comments at the airport you
                            might wish to make it clear that your purpose was to attend the
                            inauguration, to explain U.S. policy of peace, and to ask for nothing,
                            and that what you found is a friend who will make his own decisions as
                            we make ours in the light of interests and purposes of his own people.
                            We believe emphasis on peace would be helpful also to make clear that
                            our trip is major element in President's far-flung effort to move in
                            that direction.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">

                        <p>1. We need Asians to take the lead in Asian affairs. Best asset to US is
                            strong Asian leader, who is our friend, who understands us, and is <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0743"/>prepared to weld Asians
                            together toward objectives that coincide with our aims.</p>
                        <p>Suggest we bet on <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Ferdinand Marcos</persName>
                            of the Philippines as having good potential for this kind of tough,
                            charismatic leadership.</p>
                        <p>2. Let Asians take up the burden we have been carrying—on the
                            battlefield—and in the farm fields.</p>
                        <p>a. Equip two or more Korean divisions, and send them to Vietnam. They
                            could easily take the place of 30–40,000 Americans.</p>
                        <p>The price we pay for this is cheap—for the equipping Koreans is at the
                            ratio of 5–1 to 10–1 for the same equipment of the same number of
                            Americans. Moreover, the Koreans are competent jungle fighters—and are
                            ready to fight.</p>
                        <p>b. Through program grants to the Chinese on Formosa, let them carry to
                            Africa and parts of Asia, the program we have been burdened with:
                            —technical assistance in agriculture primarily. The cost of doing this
                            through Chinese instead of Americans is, again, a ratio of 3 to 1 to 5
                            to 1. Moreover, the Chinese are competent agronomists—in the area of
                            giving self-help to less developed countries, they can do the job at
                            less cost and equal efficiency.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Explanations </p>
                        <p>1. Asians take the lead in Asian affairs.</p>
                        <p>—It makes sense to put our money on Asian leaders who have already built
                            their base as a democratic leader, and not have to prop up either a
                            dictator, or a chief of government who is on shaky domestic ground.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is no puppet. In fact,
                            he needs to be a little independent of us in order to make rational and
                            credible his leadership.</p>
                        <p>—Some of the people in the Manila Embassy are skeptical—as well they
                            should be. <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> came into
                            office with the same glittering hopes only to dash them with the usual
                            ineptness later.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> could be different. He's
                            exceptionally bright (he set an all-time record for the bar exams); one
                            of the most inspiring orators in Asia; and toughly realistic. I suspect
                            he wants to be a great president, and is willing to do unpalatable
                            things in order to achieve that greatness (i.e. stop smuggling and
                            corruptness, as well as put his fiscal house in order).</p>
                        <p>—If we can work with him, and give him what help we can within reason,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> could become a rallying
                            point in Asia.</p>
                        <p>—In any case, the problems of Asia must be solved by Asians, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has the gifts of brain
                            and courage to do those things that need to be done, but which need an
                            Asian cover to be done.</p>
                        <p>Note: <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> invited me and Lloyd
                            Hand through his brother-in-law, <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Ben
                                Romualdez</persName> (who possibly will be the closest man to him,
                            and the one to whom he will listen with more credibility than any other)
                            to play golf with him on his first day in office. We teed off at 6:30
                            am!</p>
                        <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0744"/>
                        <p>He obviously wanted to let me know his regard for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>; and to emphasize his aims of
                            putting the Philippines in apple-pie order. He is a professional
                            politician, with all the sure-footed instincts of a pro.</p>
                        <p>He mentioned he was going to re-organize the Army, establish the
                            Constabulary (police force) as an independent arm (it is now part of the
                            Defense Department); and try to bring fiscal order out of the wildly
                            porous financial structure now existent. Without being sychophantic he
                            made it clear he wanted to cooperate with U.S.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that we invite him to come to the States for an official
                            visit sometime this year. Obviously he can't come right now, but
                            sometime after June, he could be ready.</p>
                        <p>He never brought this up—but I find it persuasive that the President
                            ought to size him up personally; take his measure so we can determine
                            how and what we need to do to get leadership among non-communistic Asian
                            nations.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate the prospects for the Philippines for the next two or three
                            years.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Though its problems are not critical in the short term, the
                            Philippines confronts many of the same underlying difficulties that
                            beset other states of Southeast Asia—land hunger in the countryside; <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0745"/>unemployment in the cities; and
                            a grinding poverty for the overwhelming majority of the people. The
                            situation is aggravated by widespread violence and lawlessness, and by
                            corruption in government. (Paras. 1–12)</p>
                        <p>B. Hopes for change are now focussed on the incoming President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, a capable and forceful man.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> seems aware of the
                            country's problems, but it is not yet clear how effectively he will cope
                            with them. If he fails to reduce economic discontent and to achieve
                            greater honesty and efficiency in governmental affairs, public
                            disillusionment is likely to grow and political stability could be
                            seriously undermined. (Paras. 13–19)</p>
                        <p>C. Though lawlessness is pervasive, Communists do not constitute a major
                            subversive threat to the Philippines, and are not likely to do so over
                            the next few years. (Paras. 20–23)</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is an anti-Communist and
                            supports the US on most issues respecting the Communist world. He is
                            also a strong nationalist and will seek greater equality for the
                            Philippines in its dealings with the US, particularly on those issues
                            involving US military bases and special US economic privileges. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is unlikely to hamper
                            effective US use of its bases so long as he is satisfied that such uses
                            do not run counter to Philippine national interest. He will press the
                            Congress to dispatch a proposed Philippine engineer contingent to South
                            Vietnam and can probably gain its approval, though he may have some
                            trouble in the Senate. (Paras. 24–32)</p>

                        <p>1. Introduction. The Republic of the Philippines has many problems,
                            though few are as immediately critical as those facing other Southeast
                            Asian states. There is no present external threat to its independence.
                            There is no serious internal subversion or insurgency, and the
                            authorities are sensitive to potential dangers of this sort. There is
                            virtually no chance of an attempted coup; democratic elections are the
                            accepted method of achieving political power. No major economic crisis
                            is on the horizon. All of these assets are reinforced by feelings of
                            military, political, and economic security derived from a “special
                            relationship” with the US.</p>
                        <p>2. For all of its present advantages, however, the Philippines faces, in
                            the long run, many of the same underlying difficulties and limitations
                            that confront its less fortunate neighbors. The key problem is a deep
                            and growing economic cleavage between upper and lower classes, and the
                            failure of successive administrations to carry out programs adequate to
                            remedy this situation. The situation is aggravated by the prevalence of
                            widespread violence and lawlessness in the cities and in the
                            countryside, <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0746"/>and longstanding
                            and pervasive corruption in government. Hopes for change are now
                            focussed on <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Ferdinand Marcos</persName>, the
                            newly-elected President. Should he fail to deal adequately with these
                            problems during his four-year administration, Philippine political
                            stability and democratic institutions could be seriously undermined.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Problems</hi>. Discontent among the peasants, who
                            comprise almost two-thirds of the Philippine population, stems primarily
                            from a feudalistic system of land tenure and unsatisfactory
                            landlord-tenant relations. About 40 percent of the farmers in the
                            Philippines—and a much higher proportion in the densely-settled central
                            lowland of Luzon—are tenants, most of whom customarily pay at least
                            one-half of their crop to wealthy absentee proprietors. The rapid rise
                            in population over the past 60 years has led to increased tenancy and to
                            a reduction in the size of the average owner-operated farm. The peasant
                            lives only a little above a bare subsistence level, and his annual
                            income has not increased over the past decade. The financial insecurity
                            of both tenant and small-holder is aggravated by chronic indebtedness at
                            high interest rates. The farm population is further handicapped by the
                            persistence of one of the world's lowest levels of agricultural
                            productivity; yields per acre of rice and corn, the principal crops,
                            have not increased significantly over the past century.</p>
                        <p>4. In the urban areas, the major problem is unemployment. There are an
                            estimated 750,000 unemployed and at least two million underemployed in
                            the country's work force of 11.5 million. Each year an additional
                            375,000, including 25,000 college graduates, seek employment, normally
                            exceeding the number of new jobs being created. In the cities, the
                            pressure of a large unproductive manpower pool is manifested in low
                            wages, poor working and living conditions, high crime rates, and other
                            serious social problems. Among the educated unemployed, radical causes
                            tend to flourish.</p>
                        <p>5. These problems have been intensified in recent years by a general
                            upward trend in living costs and lags in wages which have widened
                            earlier inequalities in the distribution of wealth. Although Philippine
                            real national income per capita generally rises slightly each year, the
                            gains tend to accrue to the wealthy, while among the rural and urban
                            poor, real wages and living standards usually decline. In Manila, real
                            wages for skilled and unskilled industrial workers have declined about
                            20 percent over the past decade, and the luxury consumption of the
                            wealthy contrasts most markedly with the extreme poverty of the general
                            population. Offsetting this picture to some extent is the steady rise of
                            a middle class entrepreneurial group.</p>
                        <p>6. Philippine governments have been largely ineffective in efforts to
                            ameliorate these basic problems. In the field of land reform, for
                            example, a modest legislative start was made under President Magsaysay
                                <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0747"/>(1954–1957), but soon
                            bogged down in administrative indifference. President <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s land reform program, passed
                            in 1963, was designed to abolish share tenancy in favor of lease-holds,
                            to control agricultural rents, and to raise the wages of agricultural
                            workers. The basic law itself is a good one. But the Congress has
                            subsequently provided only very limited budgetary support for the
                            program, landowners have impeded its implementation, and wage minimums
                            have not been enforced by the government.</p>
                        <p>7. The Philippine political system does not lend itself to bold
                            initiatives or sustained performance by the government in the fields of
                            economic development and social welfare. There are two major
                            parties—Nacionalistas and Liberals—and both are representative of the
                            same conservative landed and commercial interests. Other elements of the
                            population have few channels through which to influence the workings of
                            the government. Third parties which occasionally emerge to espouse
                            reform have so far lacked the grass-roots organization necessary to
                            achieve electoral strength and a major voice in government.</p>
                        <p>8. Conservative forces in the Philippines, by tradition and interest,
                            favor a very limited governmental role in economic affairs. In facing
                            problems of economic development, succeeding administrations have
                            adopted a relatively passive role, seeking to create a climate favorable
                            to the growth of domestic—as opposed to foreign—private enterprise.
                            Their concepts have not included major government investment in those
                            items of infrastructure—transport, communications, electric power, water
                            supply, and irrigation facilities—essential to increased agricultural
                            and industrial output. Annual capital outlays by the government have not
                            increased over the past five years, and whatever small direct
                            contribution has been made to economic development has been largely
                            dissipated in individual “pork-barrel” projects.</p>
                        <p>9. There are other built-in handicaps to any broad-gauge governmental
                            attack on economic problems. Foremost is the insufficiency of government
                            revenues because of a narrow tax base, poor tax administration, and
                            wholesale evasion and smuggling. Smuggling costs the government an
                            estimated $100 to $200 million annually in revenue. Government
                            operations are also severely handicapped by a system of social values
                            which accepts graft, corruption, and nepotism as normal in government.
                            Most politicians and officials act mainly in the pursuit of financial
                            benefits to themselves, their kinsmen, and their associates.</p>
                        <p>10. In consequence, the burden of economic improvement has fallen on
                            private interests. Private domestic investment in manufacturing,
                            stimulated by favorable foreign exchange and import controls, was the
                            principal force behind the growth of the national economy during <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0748"/>the 1950s when real output
                            increased by an average of 6 percent annually. In recent years, growth
                            has slowed to 4 to 5 percent annually, a pace that only narrowly exceeds
                            the rate of population increase. This stands at about 3.5 percent, one
                            of the world's highest.</p>
                        <p>11. Prospects for a return to earlier industrial growth rates are poor.
                            Expansion in the 1950s focussed on production of consumer goods for the
                            home market. The costs of the expansion were borne by raw material
                            exporters, who were forced to exchange their hard currency earnings for
                            overvalued pesos, and by domestic consumers paying higher prices.
                            Exchange reforms in 1962 (whereby export earning could be converted into
                            pesos at a free-market rate almost twice the earlier official rate) led
                            to increased import costs for raw materials and capital goods and,
                            indirectly, to a tightening of domestic credit to defend the value of
                            the peso. Moreover, tightened domestic credit, which is still in effect,
                            has come at a time when the most profitable industrial opportunities are
                            in capital-intensive ventures requiring large initial outlays. The
                            government contributes to the credit squeeze by financing its deficits
                            through the same handful of public institutions that normally provide
                            capital to the private sector. The resulting competition for loans has
                            denied credit and expansion opportunities for many enterprises which got
                            their start in a more protected atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>12. In agriculture, the picture is even less promising. The average
                            peasant lacks the incentive, knowledge, and funds required to improve
                            his crop yields. Landowners and others with enough capital to improve
                            their land or open up new acreage have generally found real estate,
                            moneylending, and other commercial ventures more profitable, though
                            landowning families increasingly are channeling capital into productive
                            industrial enterprises. Agriculture today provides one-third of
                            Philippine national income, but only 6 to 7 percent of the Philippines'
                            annual capital investment is devoted to it. Low crop yields and a
                            rapidly increasing population have over the years forced the country
                            into costly subsidies and imports of rice, the principal food
                            staple.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Prospects</hi>. President Macapagal failed of
                            re-election in November 1965 essentially because he had not brought
                            about the improvements in living standards which he had led the voters
                            to expect. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has
                            recognized the necessity for prompt action to improve economic
                            conditions. To assist industry, he proposes to ease credit arrangements,
                            to crack down on smuggling of manufactured goods, particularly
                            cigarettes and textiles, and to re-examine the tariff structure. At the
                            same time, he advocates new incentives for foreign investment. He also
                            proposes an extensive program of public works, including power and water
                            supply facilities, and roads. He has established a task force to prepare
                            the necessary legislation for the present session of Congress.</p>
                        <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' proposals indicate that
                            his will be the traditionally conservative approach to economic
                            problems. The emphasis is on improvement within the constraints of
                            existing revenues. There are only vague bows in the direction of tax
                            reform, and he is pledged above all to balance the budget and defend the
                            peso. He is relying on governmental “austerity” and greater bureaucratic
                            efficiency and honesty to cut expenditures, and upon improved collection
                            of taxes, particularly import duties, to increase national revenues. In
                            these ways, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> hopes also to
                            reduce the government's requirements for domestic credit so that private
                            needs can more easily be met.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has expressed some
                            interest in putting more teeth in the existing land reform code and in
                            improving agricultural credit facilities. However, his immediate focus
                            in the agricultural sector appears to be increased production of rice
                            and corn. By reorganizing governmental agencies involved in stimulating
                            the production and marketing of these commodities and by adopting more
                            realistic pricing policies, he seeks to provide some new production
                            incentives. There are also proposals to build irrigation facilities,
                            tapping foreign sources of funds if possible.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' economic program will
                            face the same opposition that has stymied earlier reform efforts.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, however, has certain
                            assets not available to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            or even to the revered Magsaysay. One is his outstanding legislative
                            experience; he has served in both houses of Congress and has held the
                            powerful office of President of the Senate. Another asset is his
                            connections in both major parties; until becoming the Nacionalista
                            presidential candidate in 1964, he was a lifelong Liberal. His
                            administration has gotten off to a promising start with the election of
                            a Nacionalista as Senate President and a friendly Liberal as House
                            Speaker. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            considered to be extraordinarily effective in the government
                            process—intelligent, self-confident, and forceful to the point of
                            ruthlessness, yet a “team man” capable of accepting a useful
                            compromise.</p>
                        <p>17. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will
                            undertake his program with certain handicaps. His Nacionalista party

                                Representatives.<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">The Senate consists of
                                12 Nacionalistas, 9 Liberals, 2 members of the Party for Philippine

                                In the 104-member House of Representatives, the Liberals hold a
                                majority of about 20 seats. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            And even among Nacionalistas, many old-line politicians are not
                            particularly enthusiastic about <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' proposals. To carry out his program, therefore,
                            he must win over Liberal congressmen plus the reform-minded senators of
                            the small Party for Philippine Progress (<gloss target="#t_PPP1">PPP</gloss>). The traditional lack of party discipline makes it
                            likely that at least some Liberals will defect “permanently” <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0750"/>to the administration party and that
                            many more will break ranks on specific issues. However, Liberal support
                            is likely to be costly in terms of patronage and favors, and may even
                            require certain legislative sacrifices by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>18. It is probable that in 1966, in the first flush of his electoral
                            victory, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will succeed in
                            getting important parts of his economic legislation through the Congress
                            and in effecting major administrative reforms. Some proposals may be
                            dropped by Marcos himself in political horse-trading, while others may
                            fail to pass the Congress. Experience indicates that implementation of
                            certain measures, even if passed, would remain in doubt. And even if
                            reasonably successful in implementation, his programs are unlikely to do
                            more over the next few years than halt the current economic slippage and
                            provide a mild stimulus to agricultural and industrial production. In
                            the longer run, achievement of greater honesty and efficiency in the
                            government could have a much more profound impact on the nation.
                            Vigorous efforts to galvanize the Congress and the discredited
                            bureaucracy into effective action would help restore public faith in the
                            democratic process. Success in carrying through present plans might also
                            embolden the dynamic <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to
                            attempt more far-reaching and difficult reforms, particularly those tax
                            measures which would increase the funds available to the government for
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>19. On the other hand, if <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            proves ineffective in gaining congressional approval for most of his
                            economic program or in restraining venality in the bureaucracy, the
                            public esteem which he now enjoys would rapidly evaporate. Reformist
                            parties might succeed in deflecting some of the resulting discontent
                            into legitimate political channels, but there would obviously be
                            opportunities for groups with extremist solutions, including the
                            Communists. The Philippines could probably continue in a condition of
                            inefficiency and immorality in public life for several more years
                            without political upheaval, provided that there are no unusual economic
                            stresses. In the longer run, however, it is likely that far more
                            comprehensive remedies than those so far suggested by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, and a greater degree of direct
                            government investment in the economy, will be necessary to satisfy the
                            aspirations of the mass of Filipinos. Unless the major parties can
                            adjust to these needs, other more radically inclined political parties
                            or organizations are likely to emerge.</p>

                        <p>20. The government has had very little success in coping with widespread
                            violence and lawlessness. There is a general disrespect for law and
                            order, a strong tendency toward violence as a way of settling personal
                            and political disputes, an easy availability of firearms, and inadequate
                            and often dishonest local police and judiciary. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0751"/>expressed an intention of reducing lawlessness, and a
                            vigorous attack on these conditions might have some success in certain
                            areas, e.g., Manila. In general, however, these conditions are too
                            pervasive and deep-rooted to permit much improvement in the short
                            term.</p>
                        <p>21. Despite this general lawlessness, there has been no major subversive
                            threat to the integrity of the state since Magsaysay suppressed the
                            Communist-led Huk rebellion about 10 years ago. However, the Philippine
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss>) has managed to
                            survive as a small, loosely-organized, underground movement. It
                            emphasizes nonviolent subversive activities in Manila and other urban
                            areas. There are probably fewer then 1,000 hard-core active Communists
                            compared to about 10,000 in 1950. They have concentrated on infiltrating
                            non-Communist organizations and setting up various front organizations,
                            particularly among youth and students, and have had considerable success
                            in capturing the upper echelons of several labor federations. Through
                            the agency of sympathetic newspapers and journalists, they have
                            supported and exploited ultra-nationalistic candidates and causes to
                            assist their own anti-US objectives. Among the peasants of central
                            Luzon, the Party has helped to organize some small left-wing peasant
                            groups and is actively recruiting members. It is in contact too with the
                            remnants of the Huk guerrilla force—the People's Liberation Army
                            (HMB)—estimated at 150 active members plus 2,000 supporters concentrated
                            in Pampanga Province, site of Clark Air Base. The HMB is now chiefly
                            engaged in sporadic terrorism and banditry, including the murder of
                            active opponents and informers and other acts designed to intimidate
                            local authorities and the population.</p>
                        <p>22. The threat of subversion from Indonesia has become of less concern
                            with the recent waning of Communist influence in Djakarta. Some
                            10,000–12,000 Indonesian migrants—legal and illegal—in the Mindanao-Sulu
                            area provide a potential transmission belt for Djakarta-inspired
                            subversion addressed especially to the Philippine Muslim (Moro) minority
                            there. Until recently, more serious Indonesian influence was exerted
                            through the embassy in Manila and the consulate in Davao, where agents
                            of the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian Communist Party had
                            established close contact with ultranationalist and leftist Philippine
                            elements. Chinese Communist subversive activity among Filipinos is
                            exceedingly meager at this time, but may increase with the slackening of
                            Indonesian Communist efforts. Among the Philippines' 600,000 ethnic
                            Chinese residents, the number of Communists has been estimated at
                            anywhere from 200 to 2,000. Their primary objective is probably to
                            influence the Chinese community against the Nationalist regime on
                            Taiwan, but they are a potential source of funds for the <gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss> and a possible link between it and
                            Peking.</p>
                        <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0752"/>
                        <p>23. Neither Chinese, Indonesian, or domestically-inspired Communists
                            constitute a major subversive threat to the Philippines at this time nor
                            are they likely to do so over the next few years. Their activities
                            influence a very small though vocal element of Philippine society.
                            Internal security forces are probably capable, despite the inroads of
                            politics and corruption, of coping with the existing situation. Primary
                            responsibility in this field rests with the Philippine Constabulary, a
                            16,000-man national police force operated as a component of the armed
                            services. Local police forces are relatively ineffective. The
                            Constabulary is handicapped by inadequate funds, poor training and
                            equipment, low morale, and a widespread reputation for incompetence and
                            corruption. Any significant acceleration in the growth of lawlessness
                            would severely tax its capabilities. The mission of the 14,400-man
                            Philippine Army and the smaller Air Force and Navy includes assistance
                            to the Constabulary in maintaining internal security.</p>

                        <p>24. The US. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is an
                            anti-Communist and a firm supporter of the US on most issues respecting
                            the Communist world. He is, however, a strong nationalist who has been
                            publicly critical of the US when he believed that its actions conflicted
                            with Philippine interest. On the other hand, he is less concerned than
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> with the Philippine
                            image among other Afro-Asians and is unlikely to indulge in as many
                            gestures to assert “independence” of the US.</p>
                        <p>25. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has stated that the
                            Philippine-US relationship would be strengthened by a revision of
                            existing treaties in the direction of greater Philippine equality. In
                            this connection, he will probably be more insistent than <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> on consultation concerning the
                            US use of Philippine bases in support of the Vietnam war. He will base
                            any such representations on the 1959 <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>-Serrano understanding.<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">The memorandum of understanding signed by
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> and Foreign
                                Minister Sorreno on October 12, 1959, provided for prior
                                consultation concerning operational use of bases for “military
                                combat operations.” For a summary of those and related negotiations,
                                see <ref target="frus1958-60v15">

                            consider this understanding to be binding although it has not yet been
                            formalized.) <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is also likely
                            to press for settlement of other irritants connected with the operation
                            of US bases in the Philippines. Under <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, settlement was reached on such important base
                            issues as land relinquishments, criminal jurisdiction, and military
                            cooperation. Remaining base-related problems include: entry of
                            nuclear-powered ships and related nuclear issues; entry of US and
                            third-country personnel through the bases; labor disputes; and the
                            applicability of Philippine law on the bases. We believe that such
                            problems are unlikely to hamper effective US use of the bases so <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0753"/>long as <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is satisfied that the proposed
                            uses do not run counter to Philippine national interest.</p>
                        <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> supports US policy in
                            Vietnam and has given qualified endorsement to <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>'s commitment to provide a
                            contingent of about 2,000 Philippine combat engineers to South Vietnam.
                            In general, the Philippine Congress and public also support the US role
                            in Vietnam, and there is widespread approval for the economic and
                            technical assistance which Manila has provided to the Saigon government.
                            However, there is significant opposition to any direct Philippine
                            military participation in the war. There is relatively little feeling
                            that Philippine security interests may be bound up with those of Saigon.
                            There is also a desire to avoid any costly involvement in what appears
                            to be an inconclusive struggle. In the last months of the previous
                            administration, Senate opposition to an appropriation to support the
                            dispatch of the engineer contingent was strong enough to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> not to force the
                            issue. Since the election, congressional opposition may have diminished.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> can probably gain
                            congressional approval for the proposed expeditionary force, though he
                            may have some trouble in the Senate. In pressing the Congress for
                            action, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would be motivated
                            more by the need to maintain credit with the US than by any conviction
                            that Philippine troops are needed in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>27. The course of the war in Vietnam will also have an impact on US
                            relations with the Philippines. Any conspicuous failure of US policy in
                            handling the Communist threat there would shake the faith of Philippine
                            leaders in US determination to oppose Communist China. US advocacy of a
                            neutralist solution in Laos in 1962 had a depressing effect on
                            Philippine confidence which lasted for some time. On the other hand, the
                            success of US policies in Vietnam would reaffirm Philippine faith in the
                            alliance.</p>
                        <p>28. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will also be called upon
                            to adopt positions on a variety of bilateral economic issues. While he
                            is not sympathetic to the rabid form of economic nationalism which held
                            sway during the Nacionalista administration of President Garcia
                            (1957–1961), <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will almost
                            certainly not attempt to act counter to prevailing Philippine sentiment
                            for reduction of foreign—including US—economic influence. The main areas
                            of commercial tension involve differences over the so-called “parity”
                            issue and over the Retail Trade Nationalization Law.</p>
                        <p>29. “Parity,” as expressed in the Philippine Constitution and reaffirmed
                            in the Laurel-Langley agreement, gives US investors certain rights equal
                            to those of Philippine nationals. In early 1965, a US spokesman stated
                            that the US does not intend to seek renewal beyond 1974 of parity rights
                            for enterprises exploiting natural resources or operating public
                            utilities. Nevertheless, for Philippine nationalists, “Laurel-Langley”
                                <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0754"/>remains a symbol of US
                            economic imperialism and, as frictions arise in its interpretation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will probably find it
                            expedient to uphold the antiparity position.</p>
                        <p>30. A more immediate issue between the Philippines and the US arises from
                            the application of the Retail Trade Nationalization Law. This law,
                            originally aimed at Chinese, requires all enterprises engaged in retail
                            trade to be “wholly-owned” by Filipinos and/or US citizens. In recent
                            years, Philippine courts have interpreted “retail trade” as encompassing
                            normal wholesale operations, and “wholly-owned” to mean 100 percent
                            owned by Filipinos or Americans. Few US corporations with publicly held
                            stock can meet this qualification. Some 90 US firms with investments
                            totalling over $250 million are involved and several cases are pending.
                            In light of his strong belief that increased foreign investment is
                            required, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may offer some
                            temporary administrative relief to permit US firms to adjust their
                            operations. However, he will probably not attempt to negate judicial
                            decisions or Congressional enactments.</p>
                        <p>31. Another potential source of friction is the recurrent issue of
                            Philippine veterans' claims on the US. In addition, it can be
                            anticipated that further substantial Philippine requests for military
                            assistance will be advanced.</p>
                        <p>32. Philippine nationalism will continue to grow, further removing the
                            nation from the tutelage of the US. So far, this nationalism has been
                            relatively responsible and has helped to create a somewhat distinctive
                            Philippine foreign policy while maintaining friendship, cooperation, and
                            military and economic links with the US. However, the pace of progress
                            toward full independence has not satisfied all Filipinos. A chauvinistic
                            strain among some elements in government, the press, labor, and students
                            and intellectuals completely rejects American influence and favors
                            economic nationalism and neutralism. In time, as the generation of
                            Filipinos which experienced World War II passes and is replaced by
                            younger men lacking emotional attachments to the US, such sentiments
                            will grow. The majority of present-day Filipinos, however, do not want
                            to discard the security afforded by the traditional association with the
                            US. It is unlikely, therefore, that Philippine nationalism will assume a
                            strident anti-American tone, at least so long as the US continues to
                            consider Philippine sensitivities in bilateral dealings.</p>
                        <p>33. Other Countries. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            personally hostile toward Sukarno and is less likely than <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> to seek close relations with
                            Indonesia. Should an anti-Communist leadership emerge in Djakarta,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would probably welcome
                            friendly relations with it, however, it is doubtful that he would seek
                            to revive the Maphilindo grouping—the informal linkage of Malaysia, the
                            Philippines, and Indonesia—which Indonesia would probably dominate.</p>
                        <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0755"/>
                        <p>34. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> sees Philippine regional
                            interests as best served by closer ties with Malaysia and Thailand, its
                            likeminded partners in the now dormant Association of Southeast Asia
                            (ASA). He is likely to establish full diplomatic relations with Malaysia
                            soon and with Singapore shortly thereafter. In part, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' rapprochement with Malaysia will
                            be designed to gain Malaysian cooperation in suppressing smuggling
                            operations between Sabah and the southern Philippines. It is unlikely
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will drop the
                            Philippine claim to parts of Sabah, but he will be more reasonable in
                            seeking a settlement. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will
                            probably attempt to revive <gloss target="#t_ASA1">ASA</gloss> by means
                            of frequent political, economic, and cultural exchanges. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> will continue to receive his
                            support, especially since a Filipino general is presently serving as
                            Secretary-General of the organization.</p>
                        <p>35. The Philippines under <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            will continue its policy of refusing to establish political relations
                            with Communist China, the USSR, or other Communist countries. Pressures
                            for change on this issue are unlikely to be great. However, the search
                            for new markets for agricultural products may lead the Philippines to
                            establish economic relations with the USSR and at least some Eastern
                            European states within a year or two. Cordial relations with South
                            Korea, Australia, and New Zealand will continue. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> strongly supports Nationalist
                            China and will make efforts to remove minor irritants in relations with
                            that government. Relations with Japan are also likely to improve.</p>

                        <p>3. In summary, 90-minute discussion commenced with expression by <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> of warm appreciation courage and
                            initiative shown by President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in presenting Vietnam bill, reiteration of
                            feelings of respect and deep friendship of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and American people for the
                            Filipino people and description of Honolulu Conference (HC), its
                            objectives and accomplishments. HC described as turning point marking
                            commencement of new historical period in our Vietnam experience. US and
                            its allies adhere to limited objectives Vietnam “halting aggression and

                            choice.”</p>
                        <p>4. In addition to fighting war against aggressor, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> people and Government and their allies are determining
                            how to rebuild devastated areas in the wake of murder and pillage by VC
                            and North Vietnamese forces. This is the second part of major decisions
                            taken at HC: social and economic development. Meeting of President

                            emphasized significance of excellent statement made by Prime Minister Ky
                            and fact that he and his government have themselves drawn up major
                            planning for economic and social progress. <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> pointed out that PriMin Ky has seized initiative for his

                        <p>5. Impressions of discussions in Thailand, Australia and New Zealand were
                            summarized with particular stress on discussions in Thailand. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> mentioned imminent
                            three-day visit of Thai PriMin Thanom Kittikachorn and favorable

                        <p>6. In brief discussion conditions in Laos <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> spoke of determination of Souvanna Phouma to continue

                        <p>7. After <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> noted that Communists in Asia
                            are attacking wherever they can President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said Philippines can feel it here now. He said
                            cadres are being reorganized, intellectuals are quite active and
                            leftists elements are agitating. Expressed his confidence that
                            Communists here will not get very far. He said if they were able to do
                            so they would try to mount an active military effort. Practically all of
                            the members of the Politburo of the Philippine Communist Party had been
                            caught in the early fifties and were nearing completion of 14 or 15-year
                            prison terms and their supporters are preparing for their release.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> noted that two
                            members of Indonesian Embassy here had been quite active and singled out
                            Indon Press Counselor (Rudi Gontha) as having been involved in
                            encouragement of demonstrations <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0757"/>recently. Also noted increased activity Radio Peking Tagalog
                            broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>8. Excellent performance Koreans <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            described by <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName> who also lauded Australian and
                            New Zealand contingents <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Good
                            example of these foreign forces, together with US forces, given credit
                            for improving behavior of South Vietnamese forces which are now actively
                            participating in civic action. With improved SVN morale and military
                            success, defections from Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces have
                            risen to average of 79 a day this month.</p>
                        <p>9. In acknowledging that Filipinos may have their problems at this time,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said that his

                            themselves from army in no time at all and he had ordered army to
                            discontinue listing volunteers.</p>
                        <p>10. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> stated his
                            belief that West could now permit Asian leaders to take more initiative
                            and become more involved in affairs in this part of world. He said that
                            strings on aid present problems and if strings at least are not apparent
                            it is better. He said that newly independent underdeveloped nations are
                            particularly sensitive now regarding manner in which aid is extended to
                            them. He said it is better when Asian problems can be decided by Asians
                            themselves “with your backing.” He cited Asian Development Bank as
                            excellent example of this, noting that US had furnished $200,000,000 to
                            Bank. He said Bank is “very good because it is Asian.” He said “let
                            Asians decide and solved their own problems. We want to do it
                            ourselves.”</p>
                        <p>11. Vice President stated that a principle of Honolulu Conference was
                            along these lines. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said he had studied letter to him from President

                            rural development in countries in this area. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> voiced his concern, remarking
                            that “Communists make no bones the target is rural areas.” He said

                            National Policy Paper on the Philippines. All agencies with a major
                            interest in our relations with the Philippines have cleared this
                            document.</p>
                        <p>The Paper points out that by almost every criterion for policy
                            development, the Philippines constitutes an area of key interest of the
                            US in Asia. While the Philippines since independence has achieved much,
                            it again faces some very serious problems. In essence, the future
                            depends on whether it can evolve within the next few years enough
                            responsible and dynamic leadership to overcome the stagnation that has
                            beset the country in recent years, and to bring about the economic
                            growth required to keep pace with the population explosion.</p>
                        <p>Filipinos are, to an extent, coming to doubt the wisdom of our
                            prescriptions for Philippine-American relations. The growth of
                            Philippine nationalism is inevitable. We must ensure that we do not
                            appear to oppose its legitimate expression, while taking steps
                            calculated to keep it positive and constructive.</p>
                        <p>Our over-all objective as spelled out in this Paper is to preserve the
                            Philippines as an independent and democratic nation, friendly to the US
                            and maintaining a foreign and defense policy in general alignment with
                            our own. The thrust of the strategy set forth in this Paper is to
                            preserve for the longer range the best possible environment in which to
                            protect and uphold those US interests which really count. Anachronistic
                            positions, or those which in any case we cannot count on maintaining in
                            the future, should be gradually abandoned.</p>
                        <p>In essence, over the next three to five years, the courses of action set
                            forth in the Paper will:</p>
                        <p>(1) promote motivated and dynamic Filipino leadership, which is dedicated
                            to serve the Philippine national interest and which is convinced of the
                            abiding interest of the US in the survival of a free and democratic
                            Philippines;</p>
                        <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0760"/>
                        <p>(2) persevere in helping Philippine efforts to achieve self-sustaining
                            economic growth;</p>
                        <p>(3) work toward a revised and modernized bilateral trade and investment
                            relationship with the Philippines, in which the element of partnership
                            replaces that of outworn special consideration or advantage for either
                            side;</p>
                        <p>(4) encourage and assist development of greater Philippine capabilities
                            for external and especially for internal defense; and</p>
                        <p>(5) seek to make the presence of our military bases more palatable and
                            secure for the longer term.</p>

                        <p>I know that your schedule is heavily burdened as you assume your great
                            responsibilities but I want you to know that I would personally warmly
                            welcome you if you could find a time to visit Washington. I would try to
                            adjust my schedule to meet yours and I would understand if you wished to
                            get certain matters behind you before you come. Perhaps you and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> could be in
                            touch with each other on a most private basis about possible dates, if
                            the idea appeals to you. I do think it important that the matter remain
                            private until we can make a joint announcement about your visit.</p>
                        <p>May I, in closing, express my respect for the way in which you have taken
                            hold of the reins of government and for the policies which you have so
                            responsibly and clearly set forth to guide your great country.”</p>

                        <p>The proposal also involves a direct frontal attack against the
                            deteriorating political situation and internal security problems facing
                            the Philippines, making possible a viable movement channeling legitimate
                            Filipino nationalism along Christian-Democratic lines. General reform
                            must find its beginnings and impetus in the broad bases of a society.
                            Among the more evident bases in the Philippines are the peasant and the
                            Church: the peasant because he is the mass and the ultimate focal point
                            of meaningful reform; the Church because it is uniquely equipped to act
                            as a catalyst between the government, vested interests, and the Filipino
                            peasant, who is in a sense the land.</p>
                        <p>The land tenure system in the Philippines is a basic cause of rural
                            poverty, a major obstacle to agricultural development and a main source
                            of agrarian unrest which, though traditional, is the root of the
                            internal security situation in the Philippines today. In order to focus
                            attention on the land reform problem, educating the peasant to his
                            rights and responsibilities, demonstrating enlightened need for reform
                            to politicians and vested interests and influencing the government to
                            implement reform aggressively, a fairly dramatic action is called for.

                        <p>There have been more than adequate attempts made in the Philippines
                            towards legislating land reform. During the Commonwealth period the
                            United States moved energetically and with imagination into land reform
                            and land distribution, including the purchase and redistribution of
                            “friar” lands representing large holdings by the Church. Since
                            independence, various presidents and governments have recognized the
                            need for reform, notably under Magsaysay, to some extent Garcia, and
                            most recently <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>. The
                            problem in the Philippines is not <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0763"/>to begin anew, but to improve on progress already made,
                            to moderate the influence of forces traditionally opposed to reform and
                            finally to create a demand on the government for reform from the
                            end-user, the peasant, by “popularizing” his rights under existing
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Agricultural Land Reform Code, promulgated on 8 August 1963, has the
                            stated purpose of redefining the relationship of the cultivator to the
                            land. Essentially an adequate law, it unfortunately has built-in
                            complexities, in deference to political and economic self-interest
                            groups, which prevent aggressive implementation. The Armed Forces of the
                            Philippines are heavily engaged in national civic action work having
                            ultimate effect on land reform in general. In addition, the Presidential
                            Assistant for Community Development and the private Philippines Rural
                            Reconstruction Movement have recently agreed to coordinate overall civic
                            action/reform programs, rather than continue the competition of the
                            past. A central point in the reform problem, besides inherent opposition
                            and endemic inertia, has been to approach it by governmental decree
                            rather than from a popular base. [less than 1 line of source text not

                            constructive land reform and with it the beginnings of general reform.
                            Without some such action, the dilatory approach to reform in the
                            Philippines can be expected to continue.</p>

                                PHIL)</note> These cables are long and somewhat depressing. To the
                            cynic they reveal that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            acting more and more like a Philippine President than the tough and far-
                            sighted New Dealer/pragmatist that he appeared to be earlier this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>In brief, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> does not want to
                            come to Washington unless he can return with some highly tangible
                            goodies. He fears the juxtaposition of Philippine troops to Vietnam with
                            a Washington visit, as this might tag him with the label of “American
                            errand boy”. In order to avoid such a label, he wants to extract from
                            his Washington visit U.S. responsiveness on a number of new and old
                            items: specifically, Philippine omnibus claims (a matter which we
                            officially decreed a closed book under the Eisenhower Administration),
                            base negotiations, veterans benefits (on which a joint U.S./Filipino
                            Commission will be negotiating in the next few months), U.S. procurement
                            for Vietnam, a stabilization fund, aid for the construction of a thermal
                            power plant, more school houses, and a long new list of military
                            equipment. This is not quite an all-or-nothing proposition, although
                            obviously the Fils want as much as they can get.</p>
                        <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0766"/>
                        <p>The upshot of the above is that an early and simple <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit is probably out of the
                            question. Despite the fact that his early appearance here might do us
                            some political good on Vietnam, etc., it would not do him good, in his
                            view, unless he comes back with his hands very full.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Romualdez</persName> will both be carrying this
                            message to State and the White House next week. This should give us a
                            chance to weigh more precisely our needs versus Fil needs regarding a
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit. As you know,
                            State has previously urged that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' visit be put off until much later in the year;
                            the new evidence of Fil thinking on the subject should strengthen
                            State's convictions.</p>
                        <p>I attach a possible memorandum for the President about State's request

                        <p>You have agreed to receive Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName>, Chief of Mission at Manila, at 11:30 a.m.
                            tomorrow, May 12.</p>
                        <p>This additional information concerns the two matters that he may wish to
                            raise with you: the timing of President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' State Visit; and the status of Philippine Senate
                            action on the Vietnam Aid <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">State Visit</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has informed <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> that he feels there should be
                            fairly clear “areas of agreement” between the two Governments before he
                            undertakes the State Visit. He is also worried that too early a visit
                            following Philippine legislative approval of the Vietnam Aid <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> might cause him trouble at home. He
                            is inclined toward an end of August date, which would also enable him to
                            accept an invitation to address the American Legion convention. But he
                            wishes <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> to test the
                            atmosphere here on whether tangible results might be possible by then on
                            the economic and military aid requests that he is attaching to the
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>State considers it important to our future economic relations that his
                            State Visit result in meaningful exchange of views and hopefully some
                            measure of agreement on such major issues as post-1974 US investment in
                            the Philippines, impact of the Retail Trade Nationalization Law, and US
                            aid in Philippine economic development. However, we will not be prepared
                            to reach these “areas of agreement” until much later this year after
                            more extensive economic dialogue. State, accordingly, would prefer the
                            visit in late October or November.<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2">As

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> of the Philippines
                            has sent you an unexpected letter regarding the old and complex issue of
                            Philippine World War II claims.<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">Dated June
                                23. (Ibid., Special Head of State Correspondence, Philippines, Vol.
                                I)</note> His letter comes as the U.S. Panel (chaired by General
                            Decker) prepares to depart for the Manila talks of the Joint Commission
                            on Veterans Benefits—now scheduled for July 4–8.</p>
                        <p>In essence, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' letter seeks to
                            re-open the long-closed issue of the so-called “Omnibus Claims”—assorted
                            claims by the Fil Government against the U.S. Government dating back to
                            World War II and the pre-war period. As you are aware, four of these 19
                            claims were settled by U.S. Congressional action between 1959 and 1963,
                            including $73 million in additional war damage compensation. The
                            remaining Omnibus Claims (which may amount to as much as $900 million)
                            were carefully examined and formally rejected by the U.S. Government in
                            1959, at which time the Fil Government was told that we regarded this
                            issue as closed once and for all. Both <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, however, have been under periodic domestic
                            pressure to re-open the issue.</p>
                        <p>State proposes—and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> concurs
                            from Canberra—that your reply to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> be courteous but firm on two counts: a) we are
                            always willing to listen to the Fils on any bilateral grievances,
                            including the Omnibus Claims; but b) the present U.S. Panel on Veterans
                            Benefits, established on the basis of your October 1964 Communiqué with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>, is simply not
                            empowered to make recommendations on such issues as the Omnibus
                            Claims.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you approve State's draft.<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">Attached but not printed. The letter was sent to Manila in telegram

                                Vietnam into pretty tangible returns. On other matters such as
                                    <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, economic aid or even war
                                claims, he will be sending a mission to Washington shortly to
                                discuss such questions and we might wish to defer the firming up of
                                a date for his visit until it is quite clear that he will not

                        <p>Fact of the matter is that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            does have promise, and that he did belatedly deliver on Vietnam aid (and
                            at considerable political cost)—but also that the Fil economy is in
                            dreadful condition and Fil performance has been terrible.</p>

                            irrigation rehabilitation (totalling about $8 million). The <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> Visit package will be fattened,
                            however, with some real gains on Veterans Benefits, Special Fund for

                            will come away looking good—though not as good as he would like to

                        <p>Setting <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' state visit
                            continues an established ritual for a Philippine president during his
                            term of office. Its two major elements:</p>
                        <p>1. Ceremonial reaffirmation of friendship ties developed during the
                            colonial period and second world war.</p>
                        <p>2. Confirmation of a “special relationship” with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>In return for their loyal support, Phils expect special consideration for
                            their material needs. Every Philippine president feels he must bring
                            home tangible evidence of the benefits of our association.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Special factors in this visit </p>
                        <p>1. We pressured <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to commit
                            Filipino troops to Vietnam. He put his prestige on the line, expended
                            much personal political capital, and at the expense of important
                            domestic legislation pushed the bill through Congress. The troops
                            probably will reach Vietnam while <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is here. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' performance accentuates his expectations for our
                            assist- ance on measures he has given high priority.</p>
                        <p>2. The visit will set the tone for our future dealings with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and can be a launching mechanism
                            for a new and more fruitful relationship between our countries.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is a genuine war hero
                            (with a beautiful wife), forceful, energetic and ambitious to develop
                            his nation. His materials at hand are generally unsatisfactory, progress
                            in nation building has been sporadic, and the economy is floundering.
                            However, priorities set by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            make sense. The familiar litany of past failure should not deter us from
                            giving <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> the tools he needs.
                            He may well be the last Philippine president to offer us all-out
                            collaboration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Philippine Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wants to come as the
                            representative of an Asian nation enjoying a successful and dignified
                            relationship with us. He is sensitive <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0774"/>to charges the Philippines is a mendicant, will want to
                            eliminate any justification for them.</p>
                        <p>2. Specifically, he wants to avoid any implication that new U.S.
                            assistance he may receive is a payoff for committing Phil troops to
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. He looks primarily to expanded bilateral assistance to finance his
                            development plans rather than to <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>—multilateral institutions which unfamiliar to him.</p>
                        <p>4. He seeks firm commitments (promises or assurances) of our extensive
                            financial support during his tenure for irrigation, roads, power, rural
                            electrification, land reform.</p>
                        <p>5. He will likely agree that the availability of new U.S. aid be
                            conditioned on certain actions on the part of his government, e.g.
                            increased revenue, management reform, etc., but he will want to say on
                            return that he has received specific new aid commitments provided Phils
                            do their part.</p>
                        <p>6. More immediately, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wants
                            defense support assistance to contain the resurgence of Huk-inspired
                            violence in Central Luzon. Specifically: our support of seven more
                            engineer battalions with civic action capability and the equipping of
                            three now formed. Other short-term requirements: a program loan package
                            to begin rehabilitating irrigation work and underwrite land banks and
                            agriculture credit; quick resolution of veterans benefits and claims;
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 rice, cotton and corn; a civil
                            air agreement; formalization of the 1959 <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>-Serrano agreement on base tenure; movement toward
                            revising the Laurel/Langley Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and
                            Navigation after its 1974 expiration.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will want to give a
                            spirited reaffirmation of free world solidarity and militant
                            anti-Communism.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Objectives</p>
                        <p>1. To gain maximum domestic and international benefit from Philippine
                            commitment, as a free Asian nation, to the effort in Vietnam and broader
                            U.S. policy objectives in Asia. (Advance information is <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' address to the joint session of
                            Congress will be panegyric in supporting President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and our Asian policies.)</p>
                        <p>2. To come up with an aid package that meets <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' minimum desiderata as opposed to the maximum
                            requests he has made.</p>
                        <p>3. To lay the groundwork for rationalizing Philippine development plans
                            geared to multinational support.</p>
                        <p>4. To limit new bilateral assistance to essential areas consistent with
                            longer term stress on multilateral aid.</p>
                        <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0775"/>
                        <p>5. To be forthcoming in giving <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> what he needs to put down resurgent Huk
                            activity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Groundwork and Preparations</p>
                        <p>We have talked here over the past several weeks with a Philippine
                            technical aid mission and the Phil reps on a joint panel to resolve
                            veterans benefits and claims. Informal understanding with the technical
                            aid mission has gone far toward gaining Phil acceptance of the necessity
                            for multilateral aid and placing <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' requests for large-scale aid within a context of
                            further consultation (a copy of the understanding is attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">Not attached, but see <ref target="#d334fn3">footnote 3</ref>, Document <ref target="#d335">335</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The joint veterans panel has harmoniously resolved the benefits issues,
                            but two legitimate claims were developed that still require
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>We have yet to complete action on most items in the minimum aid
                            package—support for the 10 engineer battalions, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480, the program loan package, civil air agreement, plus
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>/Serrano and
                            Laurel/Langley. Prods to Defense, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            and Agriculture are probably required.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: The following is the gist of views
                            expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> at a
                            White House meeting on August 11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> and his staff have told me that it may be
                            interpreted as constituting an emphatic statement of White House
                            interest in the full success of the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> state visit. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1. Unique ties and a special relationship continue to bind us to the
                            Republic of the Philippines. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and the Filipinos desire to
                            emerge as more than a US favorite, and we too wish to see them as an
                            Asian power in their own right. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has laid his prestige on the line to secure
                            passage of the Philippine aid-to-Viet-Nam bill in a record period of six
                            months, and has done so at some political cost. Two thousand Philippine
                            troops will begin arriving in Viet-Nam in September.</p>
                        <p>2. We have the beginnings of a very important administration in the
                            Philippines. The character of the relations we are able to establish
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> during his visit will
                            set the tone of our partnership for a long time, and during a critical
                            period, both for us and for the Philippines, in that part of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is a genuine war hero, a
                            very attractive personality, and a great public speaker. We have in his
                            visit a large amount of capital, centering around the image he can
                            project about Viet-Nam and, as President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has said, about “the vitality of the new
                            Asia.”</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has major problems,
                            including the recent revival of Communist armed activity in Central
                            Luzon, and he needs our help. He is not, and does not want to appear, a
                            mendicant. We want to help him, and we want to develop an assistance
                            package which, while meeting his needs, remains consistent with our
                            desire to emphasize multilateralism in aid to the developing nations and
                            with the new aid techniques we are developing worldwide.</p>

                        <p>5. At the head of the list of specific actions we are working on for the
                            visit are: (a) the provision of equipment for five additional Engineer
                            Construction Battalions, bringing the total for delivery to 10;<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">In a letter to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, August 11, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated: “There is nothing more important to

                            The latter bear mainly, at the moment, on our agreeing to finance via
                            project or program loans, or a combination of the two, three major
                            projects in the agricultural field, and our willingness to begin
                            negotiations after the visit on a new <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 agreement which may have to include some rice.</p>

                                possibility,<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2">In an undated memorandum,

                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> that the President asked for an
                                informal study of the feasibility of shifting B–52 operations
                                against targets in Vietnam from Guam to the Philippines since the
                                President was “struck by the obvious geographic and logistic
                                advantages.” <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> asked
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> to provide a political appraisal of
                                the idea. (Ibid.)</note> and I am providing this preliminary
                            view.</p>
                        <p>1. From the legal standpoint, the 1959 <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>-Serrano Memorandum of Understanding, which we
                            expect to make legally binding in the form of the <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> Agreement to be signed during the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit, obligates us to consult
                            with the Philippine Government before we use U.S. bases for “combat
                            launch” operations, unless these are directly related to the defense of
                            the Philippines under our bilateral Treaty, or to our engagements under
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. While it could be argued
                            that B–52 operations in South Viet-Nam fell under the latter heading, we
                            have in fact consulted with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MD5">Macapagal</persName>
                            before him, on any operational base problem whatever, including even the
                            overflight of the Philippines by B–52's. Obviously, regardless of the
                            precise legal obligation, we could not in this instance conduct the
                            proposed operations, or even prepare visibly for them, without prior
                            agreement with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. We are inclined to believe that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> personally would be favorable to conducting the
                            proposed operations from the Philippines. However, there is no doubt
                            that he would consider that he was taking a step involving possibly
                            great political costs at home, and that he would require a very
                            substantial quid pro quo in the form of additional assistance of some
                            type. Almost certainly, he would feel that he had to obtain a formal
                            resolution of approval by the Philippine Congress, particularly in the
                            light of various public statements he has made that he would take no
                            further steps in regard to Viet-Nam without thorough consultation with
                            the Congress.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0780"/>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' experience with the
                            Viet-Nam aid bill does not lead to an optimistic forecast of how the
                            Philippine Congress would react. In all probability, the same vocal
                            elements, particularly in the Philippine Senate, would oppose the direct
                            use of Philippine bases, stressing the argument that this would expose
                            the Philippines to the possibility of swift and direct retaliation, and
                            even questioning the validity of the U.S. commitment in the event of
                            such retaliation. If the issue were introduced at the present moment, it
                            would be our judgment that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            would have a long and bloody fight on his hands, and that he would
                            sacrifice the possibility of successful action on at least some vitally
                            needed domestic measures.</p>
                        <p>4. However, this rather gloomy prognosis would easily change markedly in
                            the next month or two. If the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit is a success, and if the arrival of the
                            Philippine contingent in September leads to favorable publicity and,
                            above all, a sense of engagement in Viet-Nam by the Philippine
                            people—which had really been lacking hitherto—the atmosphere could be
                            quite different by early October. There is the further possibility,
                            although it cannot by any means be counted upon, that we may by then be
                            squared away on a much more realistic economic program that would
                            furnish a reasonable vehicle for a quid pro quo that would really be
                            constructive in terms of Philippine needs.</p>
                        <p>5. For all these reasons, it would be our firm judgment that the matter
                            should not be raised with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            prior to his visit, and that at most it should be reserved for possible
                            direct mention by the President when he is absolutely alone with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> at a relaxed moment
                            during the visit, and when the basic terms of the assistance we will
                            undertake during the visit have been already worked out. More
                            tentatively, we would be hopeful that with proper timing we could
                            eventually get an affirmative answer with a not too exorbitant price; in
                            some ways, the problem is like that of getting the second Korean force
                            contribution—which could not have been done last October or November,
                            but turned out to be possible in January.</p>
                        <p>The above summarizes our present political judgment. We believe that an
                            examination of alternatives throughout the Far East should be urgently
                            pursued in any case, including comparative military and political
                            assessments of the feasibility of Okinawa and Thailand as possible
                            alternatives to the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>One further operational point. We understand the Air Force here has a
                            preference for the Mactan base, and it should be noted that this base is
                            now a joint-use base that is in effect controlled by the Philippine Air
                            Force. Moreover, the runway would require substantial lengthening.
                            Nonetheless, in our political judgment Mactan's relatively isolated
                            location near Cebu makes it a much better candidate than Clark, which
                                <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0781"/>is, of course, fully U.S.
                            but also virtually saturated by various other supporting operations, and
                            located in a much more visible, populated, and politically sensitive
                            area. Any third choice, while conceivable, would involve construction

                        <p>The Joint United States-Philippine Veterans Commission to evaluate
                            problems of Filipino veterans benefits and claims has completed its
                            findings and given its recommendations. The benefits and claims issue
                            has been a long-standing irritant in our relations with the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Panel of the Joint Commission recommended (Tab 3)<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">Not printed; Tab 3 is a letter from the Chairman of
                                the Commission, General George H. Decker, USA (ret.) to President

                            veterans. Congressman Teague has introduced appropriate legislation,
                            which if enacted would cost about $17 million per year (total cost:
                            approximately $425 million over the next 30-plus years until death of
                            the last Filipino veteran).</p>
                        <p>The Filipino Panel also raised the separate question of World War II
                            claims. Our Panel found merit in two of the seven Filipino claims and
                            referred these to Defense to determine both our moral obligation and the
                            feasibility of payment.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> recommends
                            in the accompanying memorandum (Tab 2)<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">Not
                                found.</note> that these two claims be paid. They concern pay and
                                <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0782"/>allowances for
                            approximately 100,000 recognized Filipino guerrillas and the refunding
                            of erroneous deductions from back pay. It is estimated these would cost
                            no more than approximately $42 million. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> says funds are available without new legislation.
                            Vance further recommends that the terms of settlement be embodied in an
                            Executive Agreement.</p>

                            basis and notes that settlement at this time would go far toward
                            removing a long-standing irritant.</p>
                        <p>He recommends we advise <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            prior to his arrival that we are sympathetically considering settlement
                            of the two claims, that in return <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> should agree to drop the other five as not
                            warranting further consideration, and that settlement details on the two
                            claims should be worked out jointly following the State Visit. We are
                            considering an offset arrangement to deal with the settlement's impact
                            on our balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>There are indications, not confirmed, that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may find it hard to drop the other five claims.
                            He may seek instead an overall General Release agreement for all seven.
                            If this develops, we will prepare a recommended course of action for
                            your consideration.</p>
                        <p>General Decker, Chairman of the U.S. Panel, considers the task you gave
                            him as completed and asks your instructions concerning the discharge of
                            the U.S. Panel. Since <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and

                            submits two propositions for your approval:</p>
                        <p>(1) That we give <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> a firm
                            commitment to supply equipment for 10 engineer construction battalions
                            in the Philippine Army. They would be used on rural projects, mainly
                            road-building.</p>
                        <p>(2) That we give <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> a more
                            general commitment to provide additional economic support for Philippine
                            projects related to land reform, irrigation and food production.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>We have agreed to supply equipment for 3 battalions—part of the quid pro
                            quo for the Phil decision to send forces to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>We can handle two more by readjusting MAP, deferring delivery of F–5's
                            and other equipment.</p>
                        <p>Problem is the other five battalions <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wants us to supply. Cost is about $1.7 million
                            per battalion—$8.5 million for the five.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">State argues:</p>
                        <p>—10-battalion program is a personal project of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>; he wants them more than any other single
                            item;</p>
                        <p>—project makes good sense because:</p>
                        <p>(a) it will orient Phil Army in direction of civic action and internal
                            security;</p>
                        <p>(b) it will help meet one of the Philippines greatest economic
                            weaknesses, i.e., lack of rural roads to bring crops to market;</p>
                        <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> considers it
                            essential we support the 10 battalions—to make the visit a success, to
                            preserve <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' domestic
                            prestige, and to help him counter critics who argue the Philippines (and
                            he) are too close to the U.S. and too dependent on American
                            cooperation.</p>

                            funding three battalions. He has agreed to reprogram <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '67 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            to support two additional battalions.</p>
                        <p>He opposes support for the other five, arguing:</p>
                        <p>(1) Support for five (plus equipment for one in Viet-Nam) is ample
                            recognition of the Philippines' “very small contribution” in
                            Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> money will be short;
                            appropriations are being cut (probably $92 million from the requested
                            $917 million) while we have additional claims (Thailand, Laos,
                            Korea—NATO movements—loan guarantees due to higher interest);</p>
                        <p>(3) 10 battalions are not essential to the Philippine security;</p>
                        <p>(4) $22 million programmed for Philippine <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '67 is ample;</p>
                        <p>(5) Filipinos can finance five out of their own economy.</p>
                        <p>He suggests reviewing matter for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '68
                            and deciding then whether support beyond the five proposed is desirable;
                            but he would not give <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> any
                            commitment on support in future years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">My opinion:</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that this project is one most desired by President

                            failure to back him will adversely affect the atmosphere of his visit
                            and his attitude toward us, as well as his position vs. his critics in
                            Manila.</p>
                        <p>We are talking here of $8.5 million, small in the overall scheme of
                            things.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is clear that these battalions, if equipped and properly
                            utilized, can make an important contribution to critical Philippine
                            economic needs. They have a weak public works sector. It will take time
                            to reorganize and develop. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            wants these battalions for a serious reason: to give him an efficient
                            instrument, under his personal control, to build roads and perform other
                            essential public works in the near future.</p>
                        <p>However, in view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s reservations, you might consider the
                            following track:</p>

                        <p>(1) Have <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> tell <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> we are funding three battalions
                            and are prepared now to fund two more; we will agree to putting this in
                            writing in the communiqué; we are prepared to consider funding five
                            additional battalions in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '68.</p>
                        <p>(2) If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> accepts gracefully,
                            fine. If not, <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> could tell
                            him that this is a matter you wish to discuss when he gets here.</p>
                        <p>(3) In your talks with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>,
                            repeat the pledge on five and tell him you will arrange funding for five
                            more next year. However, if he considers 10 this year absolutely vital
                            to his interests, we will do it. But he must understand that this will
                            mean trimming elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>The President expressed interest and asked me to staff out further.

                        <p>To sum up my conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Filipino Astronaut:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> has been trying to find ways to
                            bring foreign nationals into our astronaut program. They see more
                            disadvantages than advantages right now. Among the former are:
                            resentment of other nations; trouble in finding a qualified candidate;
                            let-down if man chosen flunked out, etc.</p>
                        <p>As an alternative, they propose Philippine participation in satellite,
                            sounding rocket, and ground-based research and applications programs.
                            This would start with a visit of Filipino scientists to <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>The President tell <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> of our
                            desire to encourage Filipino participation in space-associated
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> shows interest, the
                            President could offer <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> cooperation
                            in developing a program.</p>
                        <p>He could invite <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to send a
                            team of Filipino scientists and engineers to come to the U.S. to visit
                            our space facilities. <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> would act as
                            host and would help develop a program, including arrangements for
                            training of young scientists under <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss>-sponsored fellow- ships.</p>
                        <p>Note the Philippines have plans for a ground monitoring station for
                            weather satellites. The President might encourage them to press forward
                            and possibly ask if <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> needs
                            additional technical assistance.</p>

                        <p>A small joint program is feasible, provided it meshes with regional plans
                            being developed by <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> and the World

                        <p>The President would advise <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            of our interest in supporting regional planning in this field under
                                <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_WMO1">WMO</gloss>. He could also express interest in a joint
                            U.S.-Philippine typhoon damage control center program.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, he might propose: (a) a small meteorological training
                            program in the U.S. for selected Filipinos; (b) establishment of a
                            U.S.-Philippine commission to study specific projects; (c) offer to
                            conduct a typhoon modification experiment in the Philippines area in the
                            next year; (d) send a U.S. meteorological team to Manila to make more
                            detailed recommendations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There is an obvious need for a center in Southeast Asia to conduct
                            research and to develop new techniques in the field of countering <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0790"/>subversion and promoting
                            democratic political and social development. Ultimately, this could
                            become multinational. At the outset, we should consider plans for a
                            Filipino center—with them in front and us helping.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>The President could remind <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            of the Philippine initiative for a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> regional military staff college in 1956. Recall that
                            we opened joint talks with them in 1958, but nothing came of it.
                            Indicate our interest in reopening discussions keyed to the present
                            nature of the Communist threat.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was receptive, the
                            President could state his interest in seeing such a Center evolve
                            through Filipino and Asian leadership, with our support.</p>
                        <p>He could propose a joint panel of Filipinos and Americans to study this
                            proposal and recommend a course of action. Suggest that it be a
                            Filipino-directed enterprise at the outset, with the question of a
                            tie-in with <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> to be deferred until
                            it was a going concern.</p>

                        </p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> has plans underway for this kind
                            of institute, aiming for a link-up with the Asian Development Bank. The
                            critical need in the Philippines is for a rational approach to their own
                            development process. A national development institute, on the model of
                            Thailand's National Institute of Development Administration, might be
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>The President might express our conviction that development planning can
                            succeed only if it is systematized. He could offer our help in
                            developing such a systematic institutional approach.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> were interested, the
                            President might suggest the possibility of our support in developing a
                            new institute or in combining existing programs at the University of the
                            Philippines and in <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            executive office, where he has set up a small development group.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> welcomes help, offer to
                            send a U.S. technical advisory team composed of governmental and
                            foundation experts.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Manila-Tarlac Highway:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a non-starter. We gave the Philippines a highway loan in 1959—and
                            got 17 miles of road built. We need better Filipino performance—and a
                            well worked out road development plan—before trying to move on this.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Too low a priority item to draw on scarce Filipino resources at this
                            time. The main traffic problem, as I understand it, concerns
                            rights-of-way, bridge approaches and squatters at key crossings.</p>

                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> asks about civil air, you
                            might tell him if they will accept a Bermuda agreement (unlimited
                            frequencies for U.S. carriers), we will give on the route problem.
                            Informal talks could begin immediately, if he is interested.</p>
                        <p>The items above are the main problems we see coming up during the
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>There will be a good deal of hard bargaining, back and forth.</p>
                        <p>But in my judgement, there are two key factors which provide the backdrop
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit.</p>
                        <p>One, it is clear from reports from Manila that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has really put his political neck on the block in
                            backing our Viet-Nam position and in sending military forces there. But
                            he did it.</p>
                        <p>The least we can do is recognize this fact and take actions that will
                            make his position at home as strong as possible.</p>
                        <p>Second, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is a sensitive,
                            patriotic and sentimental man. He is also strongly pro-American. A
                            private and personal expression of interest and support from the
                            President of the United States will outweigh many other things. If he
                            feels your personal concern with his problems, those problems are going
                            to be easier to face.</p>
                        <p>In short, he should leave Washington knowing he has a true friend, a
                            loyal friend in the White House.</p>
                        <p>I am sure he will.</p>

                        <p>I suspect that the most important single thing you can do on this visit
                            is to ask his advice about Asia and to request him to present to you
                            candidly his vision of the future of Asia. I say this not merely because
                            of what we know of the man from reports, but from the rather remarkable
                            statement he made in response to your welcome and his toast at the State

                            occasion he spoke wonderfully well of his desire, while maintaining his
                            ties to the U.S. of reaching back into the Asian foundations of
                            Philippine life and developing on this basis a role in a new Asia.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I suggest that you tell him:</p>

                            the reasons why the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury

                            to a specific stabilization credit. He pointed out that we had never

                            for any foreign currency, and that we had extended stabilization credits
                            only in a multilateral framework involving the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. To depart from these principles would be a serious
                            problem in our relations with other countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> received a memorandum from Under Secretary
                                of the Treasury Joseph Barr, September 15, strongly recommending
                                against including in the Joint Communiqué issued at the conclusion
                                of the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> visit a U.S.
                                pledge to support the Philippines' peso. With the Department of
                                State's concurrence, Treasury stated that the United States had
                                never done this except on an ad hoc basis and it would “open up a
                                Pandora's box of requests throughout the world.” Both Treasury and
                                State opposed standby credit for the Philippines from the Exchange
                                Stabilization Fund. Such assistance should only be used in

                            President and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> also argued that the peso

                            the peso was in sound shape, there were many speculators who were
                            contending that the expenditures under the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> program would lead to inflation.</p>
                        <p>In light of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s
                            position, there was some discussion whether the paragraph should be
                            retained with general language as proposed on the American side.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> finally asked
                            whether the paragraph was necessary, and made clear that it was not
                            important from a US standpoint. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, in consultation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Romualdez</persName>, finally suggested that the
                            paragraph be dropped altogether, and this was accepted.<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">he text of the communiqué as released is printed in

                            </hi> President Johnson explained that the creation of a special
                            committee would appear to give favored status to the Philippines, and
                            that this would cause us embarrassment in other countries. He urged
                            acceptance of our draft language.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> did not press for
                            the special committee, but did ask for a reference to a “procurement
                            office.” Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> explained that the DOD simply
                            had to keep the executive responsibility for Far East procurement in
                            Tokyo, and that a separate action office in Manila would be inefficient.
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that the present Procurement
                            Information Office should provide full information, and was closely
                            wired to the Tokyo action office. Thus, with the assurance of
                            participation <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0800"/>on a “full and
                            equitable basis,” we believed we were going as far as we could.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said that the
                            problem was that a lot of Philippine sales under the program were now
                            going through middlemen in Hong Kong and elsewhere, who had better
                            information and connections to the US procurement authorities than the
                            Philippine businesses did for themselves. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            said that this was a problem that should be remedied as the new
                            Procurement Information Office took hold, and that we would take all
                            necessary steps that this was the case.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> asked specifically
                            about offshore procurement of drugs. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            explained that the US had engaged in such procurement only in very
                            special cases where there was a marked quality and price advantage, as
                            in one Italian situation. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that this
                            had to be our policy, since our general attitude was one of limiting
                            offshore procurement in every possible way for balance of payments
                            reasons. If Philippine suppliers could qualify on the basis of such
                            special advantages, they could participate, but only if this were the
                            case. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> also referred to current US policy,
                            under which steel products were not being purchased under offshore
                            procurement, and explained that this was due in part to strong
                            Congressional pressures.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> finally agreed to
                            the basic American language, but suggested the deletion of the last two
                            sentences referring to the Procurement Information Office. This was
                            accepted by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Military construction</hi>. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> asked acceptance of the
                            Philippine language. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> explained that this would carry the implication
                            of an enlarged US undertaking, and that we simply could not do this,
                            particularly at a time when we were cutting back military construction
                            within the US. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            said that we would simply have to leave it that we would go forward with
                            any plans that were fully justified, but could make no undertaking in
                            the communiqué.</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> referred to the
                            proposed Philippine sentence that would have called for an over-all,
                            Congressionally-approved settlement of all veterans matters. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> explained that any
                            further Congressional action in this area was out of the question.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> accepted
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s position, and
                            the language was removed.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Special Fund for Education</hi>. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> asked that the Philippine
                            language be accepted, releasing the Fund to the Philippines and handing
                            over its administration to a joint commission, with specified categories
                            of use. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said
                            that he was prepared to release the funds as rapidly as projects were
                            approved, and specifically indicated <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0801"/>that if President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wished to go ahead with the allocation of $3
                            million for the cultural center he would be prepared to approve this and
                            to start the machinery. (President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> did not himself refer to the cultural center, or
                            pick up this specific offer.) However, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that the existing joint
                            panels had been established to develop project proposals, and that the
                            thing to do was to have them get on with it. Finally, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that we could
                            not release the Fund to the Philippines for balance of payments
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>After some brief discussion, President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> accepted the deletion of the Philippine language,
                            and it was agreed that the American language would be revised to
                            constitute a direction to the joint panels to accelerate their work,
                            with the two Presidents concurring that there should be rapid payout as
                            projects were approved.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Paragraph order</hi>. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> began by saying that he might
                            have made a mistake in suggesting that the science paragraphs come
                            first, and that of course he would be prepared to accept another order
                            if President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> desired.
                            Nonetheless, he wanted to make clear that his reason for putting the
                            science paragraphs first was to get the “dollar sign” out of the
                            communiqué, and to make clear that the two Presidents had talked of
                            broader and more fundamental things. He enlarged on this point at some
                            length, referring to the problem of a large country appearing to give
                            largesse to a smaller country. Basically, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> stressed his belief that the
                            proposed paragraph order was in the interests of President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> seemed to take to
                            this argument, and there was some lighter exchange. Finally, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> turned to his
                            delegation and asked who had suggested the transposition, implying that
                            it had never been his idea in the first place. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Romualdez</persName> said that he had suggested the
                            changes. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> finally
                            said that of course he would accept President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s paragraph order and thought
                            it was fine. This ended the substantive discussions on a light and
                            friendly note.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: I just sure would. I would take every item
                            and show it's a regular and moderate item that has been presented. And
                            the President [<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>] did not
                            come and did not spend any of his hour and ten minutes discussing loans
                            or aid. He said that he didn't want to discuss that and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> agreed. They talked
                            about the space thing and bringing some fellowship people in here. And
                            they talked about studying the waters out there, oceanography. And they
                            talked about an insurgency school and they talked about the Asian
                            Development Bank. And I'm going out there some time, some way, I don't
                            know how. But if you want to drop that you can say that they talked
                            about that because he did urge me to come. I think that'll give you
                            something a little dramatic that will get them off the money, them going

                        <p>Whenever the United States agrees to help a country in need, it is
                            easy—and all too common—to ascribe a cynical motive to that action. It
                            is easy, too, too put a price tag on the action and to believe that
                            thereby you have described a policy. It is all too simple—and generally
                            superficial—to take an action by Government A and an action by
                            Government B and make one the “pay off” for the other.</p>
                        <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0803"/>
                        <p>This has been the approach in some of the reporting of your decision to
                            lend new assistance to the Government of President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Much of the reporting ignores several fundamental points involved in this
                            decision. Among these fundamental points, I would note the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The assistance program just announced in outline is
                                a determined effort to help a friendly country that is in
                                trouble.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Philippine economy has become almost a model of unstructured,
                            unbalanced, and stunted growth. The late 1950's were boom years. Gross
                            National Product was growing at more than 5% a year. Industrialization
                            was proceeding at a fast pace. But the rapid growth was unstable. The
                            peso was over-valued. Import prices were artificially low. There were
                            virtually guaranteed markets for the main exports.</p>
                        <p>In 1962, exchange controls were eliminated. The peso suffered almost 100%
                            devaluation. Many marginal industries were in trouble. World prices for
                            Philippine exports fell. Growth rates declined. The economy began to
                            stagnate. The agricultural sector (employing between 70 and 80 per cent
                            of the population) failed to expand. The Philippines, a rich farming
                            country, finds itself importing 90% of its milk and dairy products and
                            10% of its total food needs. The population continues to rise
                            dramatically (about 3.3% a year) as <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>
                            stagnates at about 4%.</p>
                        <p>Our Filipino friends frankly admit that their operations are plagued by
                            bureaucratic ineptness and nonperformance. Tax collections are
                            inefficient and graft-ridden. Smuggling robs the federal treasury of
                            $100 million or more a year.</p>
                        <p>In the last half of 1965, credit restraints were largely ignored with the
                            result that there was a 5% increase in the money supply since June 1955.
                            A 10% rise in living costs occurred in the same period.</p>
                        <p>In part as a reflection of deepening economic trouble, Communist
                            insurgents have increased their activity; propaganda efforts,
                            recruitment and terrorism are all on the rise.</p>
                        <p>So here is a country in deep trouble, and we are trying to help.</p>
                        <p>The cynical can assert that we are merely “repaying” Filipinos for their
                            decision to send troops to Viet-Nam. The fact is that we would have
                            helped them in any case—indeed, most of the programs now going forward
                            were being considered long before the Philippines' courageous decision
                            to help their Vietnamese neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, we are not providing economic aid to our Australian and
                            New Zealand friends—who also have sent troops to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In working with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, we are cooperating with a new and active
                                administration, one that has clearly recognized its country's
                                fundamental problems and a chief executive who is fiercely
                                determined to move his country forward.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="766" xml:id="pg_766" facs="0804"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is not a man to
                            ask for handouts or gifts without strings. He is a proud man. He is a
                            man who wants progress for his people. He believes—and we share the
                            belief—that the development and prosperity of his country is good, not
                            only for the Philippines, but for Asia and for us.</p>
                        <p>He has taken steps to improve the efficient operation of his government.
                            He has searched for men of capability and devotion and put them in
                            positions of responsibility. He continues that search. He has moved
                            actively against smuggling. He is trying to improve his country's tax
                            collection system. He has worked out a Four-Year Development Program
                            which underlines his goals, and we are working with his specialists to
                            refine that program and to outline workable and feasible projects.</p>
                        <p>And his principal goal is to improve the agriculture of his country. He
                            wants to expand productivity. He wants to build new roads that will
                            bring the countryside into contact with the towns—and therefore with the
                            markets. He wants to provide electric power for his people in the
                            countryside, and to give them the water they need for irrigation.</p>
                        <p>An important element in President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' plan is his concentration on 10 of his country's
                            provinces. These are areas where the need for improvement is
                            greatest.</p>
                        <p>Beyond meeting the present urgent problems in his economy, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> wants his country to
                            move proudly forward over the frontiers of science and technology. He
                            wants to share in the exploration of space and of the ocean depths, to
                            improve the technical and scientific training of his young people, and
                            to provide for both training and research in the area of economic
                            development.</p>
                        <p>We are cooperating with him in these ambitious enterprises—not to help a
                            man but to help a man who wants to help his people.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">A careful look at the proposed forms of our
                                assistance shows that each one is designed to help President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and the Philippines
                                to meet some of the specific problems they face—particularly in the
                                agricultural sector.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To be specific:</p>
                        <p>(1) A $4.5 million loan</p>
                        <p>This is for irrigation. It will make possible the reconstruction and
                            extension of existing irrigation works, providing much-needed water for
                            the farmers.</p>
                        <p>(2) Feasibility study loan—$2 million</p>
                        <p>This will permit the Filipinos to conduct engineering and economic
                            studies, with our help, which will tell them whether proposed new
                            projects, including additional irrigation works, make sense. These
                            studies will follow up surveys already conducted in the Water Resources
                            survey.</p>
                        <p>(3) PL–480 (Title II)</p>
                        <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0805"/>
                        <p>A grant of food grains and other agricultural products.</p>
                        <p>This will provide:</p>
                        <p>(a) Partial payment (in the amount of $3.5 million) to some 30,000
                            workers who will be digging and renovating irrigation ditches and
                            building or repairing local roads.</p>
                        <p>(b) $.5 million in grains, returns from which will help to capitalize
                            livestock cooperatives.</p>
                        <p>(4) <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 (Title IV)</p>
                        <p>Sale of between $20 and $25 million worth of needed cotton, feed grains
                            and tobacco.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: This is repayable in dollars at 3.5%
                            interest.)</p>
                        <p>The peso proceeds from sale of these products will provide increased
                            capital for the Agriculture Credit Administration.</p>
                        <p>They will also be used:</p>
                        <p>—for local costs of irrigation rehabilitation projects;</p>
                        <p>—for feeder road construction;</p>
                        <p>—possibly for some capital for the Land Bank.</p>
                        <p>There may also be some small grants to government agencies for such
                            things as: agricultural research, technical training in agriculture;
                            pest and crop disease control; land classification studies in connection
                            with land reform.</p>
                        <p>(5) Engineering equipment ($1.8 million)</p>
                        <p>This is equipment from surplus military stocks. It will be renovated by
                            use of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds. Value of the repaired
                            equipment is estimated at $10 million and it will be given to provincial
                            governments (in 8 of the 10 critical provinces). The equipment is to be
                            used in the road-building program and for irrigation and other
                            agricultural development projects.</p>
                        <p>We will also be supplying some spare parts and technical training on
                            operations and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>(6) Other technical assistance (about $1 million)</p>
                        <p>To be used for such things as providing for a team from the U.S. Farmers
                            Union to advise on agricultural credit, and for a team from the Rural
                            Electric Cooperative Association to help work up projects for
                            establishing new rural electrification cooperatives.</p>
                        <p>(7) <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 (Title III)</p>
                        <p>This is a continuing program. It provides food products to U.S. voluntary
                            agencies, such as the Catholic Relief Service, for their programs of aid
                            to needy Filipinos.</p>
                        <p>(8) In view of the need for better performance in the tax collection
                            field, we have sent several specialists from the Internal Revenue
                            Service to the Philippines. This is a small project which represents
                            about 2 1/2 man-years of labor on our part annually.</p>
                        <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0806"/>
                        <p>Even our assistance in the military field is related closely to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> desire to help his
                            farmers. The five engineer battalions we have agreed to support this
                            year with equipment will be used by him in civic action
                            projects—primarily road-building in rural areas.</p>
                        <p>This, we see when we look beneath the titles and the amounts, that the
                            assistance program that we are working out with the Philippines is
                            designed to meet specific needs, and primarily those needs in the field
                            of agriculture which the Philippine Government and we recognize as most
                            urgent.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Finally, it should be clear that the kind of program
                                outlined in this memo and which we hope to carry out with the
                                Philippines Government is a reflection of your consistent—and often
                                repeated—concern with the problem of food production in a world
                                where the population is rising steadily.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, on March 19, 1964, in your foreign aid message, you
                            noted:</p>
                        <p>“Funds for educational and technical cooperation—to help start schools,
                            health centers, agricultural experimental stations, credit services, and
                            dozens of other institutions … But they will be used by selected
                            projects to raise the ability of less fortunate peoples to meet their
                            own needs.”</p>
                        <p>A year later, on January 14, 1965, you said:</p>
                        <p>“In the years ahead, if the developing countries are to continue to grow,
                            they must rapidly enlarge their capacity to provide food for their
                            people. Up to a point, they can and should improve their ability to buy
                            some of their food from abroad. For the most part, however, they must
                            expand and diversify their own production of food.”</p>
                        <p>On February 10, 1966—in your <hi rend="italic">Food for Freedom—you
                                said:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>“We will launch a major, new attack on worldwide hunger. We will present
                            this year a new food aid program designed around the principle of
                            intense cooperation with those in all hungry countries who are ready to
                            help themselves. We will direct our assistance program toward a
                            cooperative effort to increase agricultural production.”</p>
                        <p>And again this year—on June 30, 1966 in your <hi rend="italic">Food for
                                Peace Report— you said:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>“In simplest terms the task of bringing food and population into
                            balance—while maintaining progress in health, education and economic
                            growth—is the most critical challenge many countries are facing today.
                            It will probably remain their most urgent challenge in the immediate
                            years ahead. The world's capacity to respond will dramatically affect
                            the course which individuals and nations choose in confronting their
                            problems and neighbors in coming generations.”</p>

                            be talking, topics that may come up, and suggested positions. This
                            memorandum is a shorter summary, for your personal use, of those key
                            items that may require your personal attention and some review of the
                            detail with me prior to our talks. I have also highlighted sensitive
                            issues that may not be raised in high-level conversations, but of which
                            you should be aware.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum does not cover the question of your speeches and
                            statements. Drafts of these will reach you through your own staff, on
                            the basis of materials prepared by the Department and your staff.</p>
                        <p>In looking at each visit, we have all tried to find special topics on
                            which you could make new proposals or offers of assistance that would be
                            consistent with our interests apart from the trip. Items of this sort
                            will appear in the speech material, but by far the most basic issues
                            concern military assistance for Thailand and the question of our rubber
                            stockpile disposal policy for Malaysia. Both of these would be critical
                            in any event at this time, and the handling of them could have a great
                            effect on the atmosphere of your visit to each of these two countries.

                            is of course way in excess of the total of approximately $100 million
                            which would be reached by adding every single item on the list—economic
                            aid, military aid, and the first year cost of veterans benefits and the
                            two claims. The Filipinos have latched onto the ultimate actuarial
                            payout on veterans benefits ($425 million by our calculations), and are
                            also inclined to throw in World Bank loans ($40 million) and all their
                            private lending commitments now outstanding. This kind of “numbers game”
                            is regrettably an old Philippine institution. I would recommend that if

                        <p>1. The resurgence of the Hukbong Magpapalaya Sa Bayan—commonly known as
                            the Huks—could cause President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> serious <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0809"/>political difficulties, although so far the resurgence poses no major
                            threat to his government. He has made eradication of the Huk movement,
                            mainly based in Central Luzon, a major goal of his administration.<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">In a Special Report Weekly Review, <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> No. 00758/67A, February 24, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> concluded that during his 14
                                months in office, “<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has
                                broadened the Philippines involvement in Far Eastern international
                                problems, while showing little more than good intentions on the
                                domestic front.” Such a concentration “has tended to leave
                                relatively untouched the deep-seated social, economic, and political
                                problems.” The report noted that there was “widespread discontent
                                with pervasive rural poverty and rising urban unemployment has
                                contributed to a rise in crime and violence as well as a resurgence
                                of leftist activities” including the revival of a modest threat from
                                the Huks. (Ibid.) The President apparently did not see this
                                report.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. During the past 20 months, both the strength and the activities of the
                            Huks have shown a marked increase. The number of armed cadre has grown
                            from an estimated 37 to possibly 300–400, and the US Embassy in Manila
                            estimates that the mass base support has increased by five to eight
                            percent to about 28–29,000 persons, roughly one percent of the
                            population in the affected provinces. The number of assassinations and
                            kidnappings jumped abruptly from a total of 17 in 1965 to 71 in the
                            first eight months of 1966. Although later figures are not available,
                            the higher level of activity appears to be continuing. The most flagrant
                            act of terror was the murder in July 1966 of Mayor Anastasio Gallardo of
                            Candaba, chairman of the anti-Huk Mayors' League of Pampanga, while he
                            was on his way to a meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. The league has since become dormant, its members
                            fearing Huk reprisals.</p>
                        <p>3. Originally the paramilitary arm of the illegal Philippine Communist
                            Party (<gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss>), the Huks over the years
                            have taken on the appearance of marauding bandits and extortionists,
                            rather than of revolutionaries motivated by Communist ideology. Although
                            there have been recent indications that recruits are again receiving
                            Marxist indoctrination, among the peasantry the Huks maintain a “Robin
                            Hood” image of assisting the poor. In fact, the Huks' separate system of
                            justice in the area they influence, chiefly in the rice-producing
                            provinces of Central Luzon, appears to be more efficient than the
                            government's slow-moving and often corrupt judicial system. The Huks'
                            decisions, which do not always favor the peasant, seem to be accepted by
                            many landlords as well.</p>
                        <p>4. The Huks' present ties with the <gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss>
                            are vague and contradictory. The terrorism that sustains Huk power is
                            not in keeping with the party's purported abandonment of terror for the
                            “parliamentary struggle.” Links between the leadership of the two groups
                            appear tenuous. Pedro Taruc, until recently the Huk chieftain, is one of
                            a three-man committee that reportedly has taken over the functions of
                                <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0810"/>imprisoned <gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss> secretary general Jesus Lava. According
                            to a recent report, however, Taruc has relinquished Huk leadership to
                            Faustino del Mundo, whose Communist leanings are believed none too firm.
                            Other reports suggest that the imprisoned former party leaders may
                            retain control through intermediaries of both the party and the
                            Huks.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> moved quickly to meet the
                            revived Huk threat. Last June he launched Operation Central Luzon, later
                            renamed the Central Luzon Development Program. The immediate mission of
                            this plan was to implement the land reform code in critical areas of
                            eastern Pampanga Province, Central Luzon, and eventually to construct
                            roads, schools, and irrigation projects, and to improve agricultural
                            methods. So far, results have been modest. To improve security
                            conditions, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has requested
                            funds in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1968 budget to expand and
                            improve the Philippine constabulary.</p>
                        <p>6. A major stumbling block to reducing Huk influence is the continuing
                            collaboration of local politicians seeking the votes the Huks can
                            deliver. With the approach of off-year elections this November, there
                            appears to have been an increase in this collaboration. In Pampanga, the
                            Huks seem to enjoy the support of the governor. More critical, however,
                            is the evident acquiescence of much of the peasantry. This attitude can
                            be expected to continue as long as local landlords block reform efforts,
                            as corruption by officials diverts funds from development projects, and
                            as legal redress remains slow and one-sided.</p>
                        <p>7. A manifest failure by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to
                            reduce Huk influence could contribute to his future defeat at the polls.
                            Over the long run, if not effectively dealt with, the Huk movement could
                            again develop into a major insurgent threat.</p>

                        <p>1. We have carefully reviewed the proposed USAID multi-year strategy
                            paper (<gloss target="#t_MYSP1">MYSP</gloss>) full text of which being

                            and strongly endorse it. This paper directly addresses the problems
                            facing the US in the Philippines and the fundamental issues associated
                            with Philippine economic development; and proposes a plan of action
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>1975, along with priorities,
                            that we believe is both realistic and necessary. Highlights follow:</p>
                        <p>2. Major emphasis. The <gloss target="#t_MYSP1">MYSP</gloss> has four
                            main points of emphasis as follows. It emphasizes (1) the development
                            and support of local governments and private institutions as viable
                            alternatives for total dependence on central government agencies, and as
                            vehicles through which economic development programs and projects can be
                            executed: (2) that as the Philippine agricultural program gains momentum
                            there should be a decrease in social unrest in rural areas with unabated
                            social unrest in urban areas, requiring a balanced socio-economic
                            program to offset both; (3) the postponement, to the extent possible of
                            major US capital and large-scale conventional technical assistance
                            projects until later in the planning period and after appropriate
                            institutions have been developed and are functioning; and (4) a
                            recognition of the advisory role of USAID technicians who perform
                            catalytic and promotional functions in the private sector and at both
                            the central and local levels of government, particularly the latter
                            (which already extensively done by number of USAID staff).</p>
                        <p>3. Consequences of this approach. In order to make the plan effective we
                            see a need to increase the USAID staff from its present level; a need
                            for local currency, in part to be derived from <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>480 sources; and probably a need for closer cooperation
                            among all US agencies at the working level. Staffing and peso
                            requirements have as yet not been worked out, in terms of magnitude and
                            timing over the eight year planning period. Likewise organizational
                            requirements for the US Mission have not been thought out. Before we
                            proceed with these details we need general agreement on the proposed
                            overall approach which, we repeat again, is in our judgment realistic
                            and necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. USAID goals. In view of the US objectives in the Philippines and in
                            Southeast Asia, the problems the US faces in realizing these objectives,
                            and the approach set forth in the USAID <gloss target="#t_MYSP1">MYSP</gloss> to enable progress to be made, the following six goals
                            are proposed as ones which will govern USAID activities over the
                            planning period, subject of course to modification if and when basic
                            conditions in the Philippine setting change, e.g., stepped up Communist
                            activity in the Philippines <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0812"/>emanating from outside the Philippines, failure of agricultural
                            program, etc.</p>
                        <p>(1) Demonstrating to the Filipino elite, nationalist and other, the
                            advantages of pursuing a vigorous economic development policy that is
                            outside partisan politics, and ultimately identifying nationalism with
                            growth and prosperity;</p>
                        <p>(2) Denying potential Communist or other subversive exploitation of those
                            Philippine socio-economic problems most susceptible to exploitation, and
                            thus preventing diversion of Philippine energies from the task of
                            economic development;</p>
                        <p>(3) Creating for the Filipino elite and <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> policy makers an expanded reservoir of patriotic
                            Filipinos who are capable of viewing objectively the socio-economic
                            problems of their country;</p>
                        <p>(4) Improving, on a modest scale, Philippine health, education and public
                            administration, in preparation for the time when economic development
                            becomes a national policy;</p>
                        <p>(5) Developing private Philippine institutions and local governments,
                            where possible, to become viable alternatives for central government
                            bureaucracy, and through which programs and projects can be
                            executed;</p>
                        <p>(6) Encouraging non-US assistance in financing and executing foreign aid
                            projects in order to gradually focus Filipino attention away from the
                            United States, and particularly within the Southeast Asia region
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The specific program components associated with the achieve- ment of each
                            goal, along with priorities over time, are identified in the <gloss target="#t_MYSP1">MYSP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. The foregoing outline of the new approach proposed in the <gloss target="#t_MYSP1">MYSP</gloss> was reviewed by the Ambassador and
                            USAID director prior to their departure for Washington and approved in
                            principle. It reflects a growing view within this Mission that more
                            vigorous steps and new departures are essential in the general thrust of
                            our aid programs in the Philippines if we are to assist the present
                            administration in halting the downward internal spiral which has
                            characterized the past several years and in effecting a reasonable
                            turn-around.</p>
                        <p>6. In its early phases it will represent a concentration of effort in
                            those areas which in our judgment appear to offer the greatest present
                            hope of success; i.e. a selective concentration on those provincial or
                            local activities which bear continued promise of producing immediate
                            though initially small-scale results at the grass roots level, in the
                            expectation that these may spread more generally to other areas of the
                            country and take hold. It represents, moreover, a deliberate effort to
                            identify <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0813"/>ourselves
                            progressively and to the extent possible with the common man, whose
                            restiveness is increasing.</p>
                        <p>7. It would bypass in many places the central national bureaucracy and to
                            this extent would admittedly constitute a greater US involvement in the
                            internal affairs and political habits of the country. It cannot, on the
                            other hand, be accomplished without the wholehearted support of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> administration and must
                            accordingly be sold to the President and his immediate advisors in such
                            a way as to enlist their full support. Given <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' continued determination to effect major internal
                            improvements, however, and his enthusiasm for earlier efforts along
                            these lines, we are optimistic that he can be persuaded.</p>
                        <p>8. This does not imply that the projected policy would entirely neglect
                            efforts at the national level. Some elements of the program would
                            continue to be directed specifically in that direction, and toward the
                            end of the project it would be our hope that progressively more of our
                            joint effort could be channeled in that direction as the overall
                            situation improved. But the major thrust of our assistance and advisory
                            efforts during the early stages would clearly involve a new emphasis on
                            local administration, building hopefully on our experience and success
                            in the immediate past with the US supported rural development
                            program.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You will recall that we are supplying equipment for five engineer
                            construction battalions for the Philippines. This was in response to <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0814"/>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' request made during his visit
                            last Fall. The equipment is all to be delivered by the end of this
                            month.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, you agreed to consider supplying equipment for a second
                            five battalions in Fiscal 1968. As you know, nothing ranks higher on
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' list of
                            priorities than equipping these 10 battalions for vital civic action
                            work—road building, irrigation, etc. Reports from Manila indicate the
                            Filipinos are beginning to use effectively the equipment thus far
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that failure on our part to carry through on the second
                            five would be read by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>—and
                            by his political enemies—in this election year as clear evidence of
                            unwillingness to back him on an important program to which he is
                            publicly committed. On the other hand, the political and psychological
                            advantages of our moving forward—even before he pushes us on the
                            matter—would be great.</p>
                        <p>State and Defense recommend that we promise the additional equipment (see
                            attached memo from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>).<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">Dated June 5, not

                            the recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Defense has made available an additional $4.4 million from overall <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.
                            This will take care of more than 2–1/2 battalions. The additional $4
                            million required can be acquired by cutting some lower priority items
                            from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 Philippine <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>While promising to supply the equipment, we would not give a firm pledge
                            on timing of deliveries. However, I am assured that every effort will be
                            made to complete delivery in CY 1968 and possibly in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968. This will depend, in part, on the
                            timing of Congressional action on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I still think often and warmly of your and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' visit to Washington last year,
                            and of our later meetings in your capital during <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0816"/>the Manila conference. And I read with
                            close attention reports from your country, especially those which
                            describe your courageous struggle to meet the urgent problems that
                            confront you.</p>
                        <p>Some of these reports have caused me to give a good deal of thought in
                            recent weeks to the relations between our two countries. From a remark
                            you made some weeks ago to an American reporter—that our relations 'are
                            in a vexing and irritating period of readjustment'—I know that this
                            question is very much on your mind, too.</p>
                        <p>I think it would be useful, therefore, if you and I could exchange views
                            on this important subject. I believe we should explore together what can
                            be done to strengthen and deepen our relations, and to remove, or at
                            least reduce, such irritants as exist.</p>
                        <p>At the outset, I must say that I have no doubt whatsoever that our
                            relations rest on a solid foundation. Our shared history and common
                            values are important parts of this foundation. In the long run, of
                            course, durable and harmonious relations between nations depend on their
                            national interests, but here, too, I find no cause for anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Your national interests and ours are on parallel courses. Our two
                            countries are cooperating toward the goal of peace in the Pacific. Our
                            military presence in the Philippines contributes to your security and
                            enables you to concentrate your resources more fully on social and
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, our presence permits us to fulfill our heavy
                            responsibilities in the area as a whole.</p>
                        <p>You and your administration are making strenuous efforts to build a
                            strong and expanding economy, one that will give your people more jobs,
                            improved housing, a higher standard of living, broader education, and
                            better health. I know that you are pushing ahead to expand internal
                            savings, both public and private, to finance these efforts. We ardently
                            hope that you will succeed.</p>
                        <p>I know very well the difficult problems you face in these efforts to
                            produce effective programs and convert them into actions. I assure you
                            that we are anxious and ready to help.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we both realize that irritations exist. During your
                            visit to Washington and since, you and I have cleared up many of these
                            matters which had been pending too long.</p>
                        <p>Our governments signed a new agreement on bases tenure. We have supplied
                            high-speed boats to help in your anti-smuggling campaign. We have taken
                            action on veterans' benefits and are making progress on claims. We
                            reached agreement on the first two projects under the Special Fund for
                            Education. Our A.I.D. program is going <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0817"/>forward in promising new directions, particularly in
                            rural development. We are ready to begin discussion of the concept of
                            our trade relations after the expiration of the Laurel-Langley
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Your program to raise rice production is among the most hopeful in Asia
                            today.</p>
                        <p>We agreed last September to equip five engineer battalions which, in
                            addition to their military mission, are carrying out vital civic action
                            programs. I am assured this equipment will be delivered by the end of
                            this fiscal year. I have read encouraging reports on the potential of
                            those battalions and the key role they are beginning to play in your
                            economic and social development effort.</p>
                        <p>I have considered providing equipment for the second five battalions, as
                            I promised to do. I am happy to tell you that we will be able to provide
                            equipment for these additional battalions, subject, of course, to the
                            availability of appropriated funds. The equipment for these battalions
                            will be financed in part from this year's funds, and the balance from
                            new appropriations. Some of these funds represent additional assistance,
                            but some may have to come from within planned military assistance levels
                            with engineer equipment replacing items of a lesser priority. I hope
                            that you will treat this undertaking as wholly private between us. I
                            believe we should consult closely as to the appropriate timing and form
                            of an announcement, and I would appreciate your views on this at your
                            early convenience.</p>
                        <p>When you were here, you and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> told us of your deep interest in providing
                            support for the Philippine National Cultural Center. I have looked into
                            this and am delighted to tell you that I have now authorized Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> to work out formal
                            arrangements with your officials along the lines of the proposal your
                            Government advanced earlier this year. This calls for a $3,500,000
                            contribution into a trust fund, the interest on which will be used to
                            finance the programs and operations of the Cultural Center.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes we cannot meet requests from your Government. The turnover of
                            Sangley is an example. That base serves important security and defense
                            purposes—ours, yours, and those of our allies. When we studied the
                            matter, we saw no feasible way of shifting the operations elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I assure you that I will do everything in my power to help you in every
                            way I can. I am deeply desirous of doing all possible to reduce
                            irritations. I know the presence of American military personnel in the
                            Philippines is bound to produce some strains. But I am sure you will
                            agree that mutual understanding and mutual sensitivity can keep those
                            strains within bounds.</p>
                        <p>Our common problems cannot be solved only by the actions of one or the
                            other of us. And I must confess candidly that I am troubled <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0818"/>by the chorus of extreme criticism from
                            some Filipinos directed against us, our policies and our actions.</p>
                        <p>I am troubled, also, by signs of increased hostility toward foreign
                            investment, a matter that is being discussed extensively now in American
                            business circles.</p>
                        <p>As you know, foreign capital played an enormous role in the economic
                            development of the United States. It could do the same in the
                            Philippines. But it is not likely to be attracted if it is regarded with
                            suspicion and distrust.</p>
                        <p>I realize you are doing what you can to keep these matters in true
                            perspective for your countrymen. I hope the report by the special
                            committee on Philippine-American relations of your Congress will provide
                            a better and deeper understanding of what is involved in our relations
                            and what needs to be done to further improve them.</p>
                        <p>It was my hope that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> would be able to visit your country and to
                            discuss these matters in detail. Unfortunately, his journey to the
                            Philippines and other countries of the area had to be postponed because
                            of the Middle East crisis and other urgent business here. He will be
                            heading our delegation to the inauguration of President Park in Seoul,
                            but will return immediately to Washington.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped the Vice President could deliver this letter during his
                            visit. I have, instead, asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> to present it to you promptly.</p>
                        <p>I have written to you as I can only to a friend, knowing that you have
                            given these matters a great deal of thought. I would deeply value your
                            views on what we each can do to serve better our common interests and
                            our shared purposes. You know how much I value your friendship and
                            advice, and how much I believe in the close and continuing cooperation
                            of our two countries and peoples.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>”</p>
                        <p>2. In addition, you should make clear following point orally to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>: We want to make clear
                            that while we will provide the funds in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>1968 we are not undertaking to deliver all of the
                            equipment in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>68. We will, of course, do
                            our best to deliver the equipment as rapidly as possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> reported in telegram
                                12912 from Manila, June 25, that he delivered the letter to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> who read it then
                                and was pleased. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> that hostility
                                toward American investment was politically motivated pressure from
                                vested Philippine business interests. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> promised a showdown on the pending Investment
                                Incentive <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>. He dismissed
                                the extreme criticism of the United States by noting it came from a
                                small minority of politicians who collaborated with the Japanese in
                                World War II, whose outlook was “professional anti-American.”

                        </list>
                        <p>We discussed the desire of John Macy's office (Lou Schwartz and Bob Cox)
                            for information on U.S./Philippine relations relevant to the selection
                            of a new Ambassador. They insisted on a quick oral briefing. What
                            follows is a reconstruction of the conversation. I will be delighted to
                            make any additional points or changes of emphasis that you deem
                            advisable.</p>
                        <p>(1) It would be nearly impossible to overestimate the gravity of the
                            problems with which our next Ambassador to Manila must deal. It has
                            become common-place for people knowledgeable on the Philippines to
                            predict a vast social upheaval in the near future. There is widespread
                            talk that the current president will be the last popularly elected
                            Philippine chief executive. Many high-level American officials consider
                            the Philippines to be the most serious and the most bleak threat that we
                            face in Asia. It is absolutely essential that we have a Chief of Mission
                            in Manila who can come to grips with the problem.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Philippine Republic is stagnant. There is practically no increase
                            in the per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The government
                            has failed lamentably to come to grips with the problems in economic and
                            social development. Both the government and the society are shot through
                            with a pervasive and paralyzing corruption. There is a revived
                            subversive Huk movement which is serious, though not yet critical. The
                            Huks actually control much of Central Luzon, including the Clark Field
                            area, and it is a fact that the Huk movement is being financed, in large
                            part, by expenditures connected with the Clark Field complex. No
                            Filipino President has ever <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0822"/>been reelected, which is a measure of dissatisfaction and frustration
                            of the Filipino masses with government performance. The birth rate
                            approaches 4% a year.</p>
                        <p>(3) Philippine/U.S. relations are still in a state of transition from
                            colonial days. Although there is a strong residue of affection for the
                            U.S. among the masses, ultranationalism is rampant in the elite. The
                            U.S. and the American Embassy are the natural focus for ultranationalist
                            suspicions and hostilities. The press, in particular, is dominated by
                            the ultranationalists and has a very strong anti-American flavor.
                            Regardless of who our Ambassador is and however properly he comports
                            himself, he and his family will, beyond doubt, be subjected to vicious
                            and personal press attacks. The position of the U.S. Ambassador in
                            Manila is unique. He is part governor-general and part shipping boy. On
                            the one hand the Philippines want to retain a special relationship with
                            the United States. On the other hand, they bitterly resent their
                            dependence upon us and any assertion by us of a special position. Our
                            Ambassador in Manila is in the middle of this psychological cross- fire
                            and gets hit from both sides.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>First and foremost, the Ambassador will need to be able to identify the
                            levers of power in the Philippine system and to manipulate them
                            effectively to help bring about economic and social movement. He must be
                            a man who understands the development process. It will be essential that
                            he work effectively in helping President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> straighten out the Philippine public sector. Tax
                            collections, smuggling control, and some minimum level of efficiency and
                            honesty in the Philippine bureaucracy are exigent problems in the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The United States has three major bases (Clark Air Force Base, Subic Bay
                            Naval Base, and Sangley Point Naval Base), and a number of smaller or
                            leased installations. Although our Base Rights run for 24 more years
                            (under a 1966 agreement) it is by no means inconceivable that the
                            Filipino nationalists will put pressure on our use of the bases. The
                            bases are central to our operations in Viet Nam and our longer range
                            military effectiveness in Southeast Asia. The style with which our Base
                            Rights are exercised now may determine our long-run access to these
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>The future of U.S./Philippine trade relations, the status of the American
                            business community in the Philippines, and the future for American
                            investments in the Philippines will all be determined in negotiation
                            which will begin this fall. The negotiation looks to the replacement of
                            the Laurel-Langley Agreement, which has, since independence, regulated
                            U.S./Philippine economic relations.</p>
                        <p>In the immediate future, the U.S. will undoubtedly be pressing for a
                            larger Philippine contribution to the Viet Nam war, an issue of the <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0823"/>greatest political sensitivity
                            in the Philippines because of the activities of the
                            ultranationalists.</p>
                        <p>Politically, the Philippines is a cesspool, and the Ambassador must be
                            capable not only of surviving in a poisonous atmosphere but of working
                            in it effectively, for his major weapon will be his influence on
                            Philippine President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is a completely
                            political being.</p>
                        <p>In the Philippines, power is concentrated in the presidency to a
                            remarkable extent. Our Ambassador carries on most of the important
                            business directly with the President. The ability to develop a close
                            official and personal relationship with the President is essential.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is the Philippines'
                            most decorated war hero. He is an accomplished golfer (a 7 handicap).
                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is very powerful in
                            the Administration. She has a strongly extroverted personality and makes
                            no bones about enjoying gay and festive occasions, including dancing
                            parties that go on until dawn. There is, in addition, a general
                            Philippine fondness for banter and horseplay and our Ambassador will be
                            expected to join in this atmosphere with evident enjoyment. Extensive
                            travel throughout the Philippines is an important part of our
                            Ambassador's duties, and is physically demanding, among other reasons,
                            because Philippine hospitality on these occasions has, as an invariable
                            concomitant, subsequent stomach disorders.</p>
                        <p>The American community in the Philippines is large. American private
                            investment runs at $550 million, and there is a big American business
                            community in Manila. There are about 40,000 American military personnel
                            in the Philippines and probably as many dependents. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] a Peace

                            Ambassador will, therefore, need to be a man with considerable executive
                            talent.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador will need to know Asia. The main thrust of Philippine
                            nationalism is to carve out a place for the Philippines in Asia.
                            Filipino membership in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, its role
                            in Viet Nam, its participation in Asian regionalism, and its relations
                            with its Asian neighbors are essential elements in Manila's policy. One
                            who doesn't understand Asia can easily be trapped by history and
                            superficialities into thinking of the Philippines as somehow less than
                            completely Asian. But there can be no health in the U.S./Philippine
                            relationship unless it is based on a mutual acceptance of the
                            Philippines as an Asian state rather than an American protege. One who
                            understands Asia will know this in his bones. One who does not
                            understand Asia could easily destroy his utility in Manila before he
                            learns it.</p>
                        <p>In short, the U.S. needs a paragon in Manila. He must be an adept
                            politician. He must thoroughly understand the development process and be
                            able to advise President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in
                            his efforts to revivify the Philippine public sector. He will have to
                            work with a substantial U.S. <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0824"/>military community in harmony. He will need to understand the problems
                            of business and to deal with an influential American business community.
                            He will preside over an impressive official U.S. community and will need
                            to be a person of executive talent. He will need a substantial amount of
                            personal charm to operate effectively in the Filipino atmosphere. He
                            will need to be impervious to unfair and sometimes vicious press
                            attacks, both of a personal and political nature. Most of all, he will
                            need to be extremely tough-minded in grappling with a whole series of
                            problems, which no one has been able to deal with effectively yet, but
                            on which progress must now be made without delay as a matter of high
                            national policy. He will need the sensitivity of a chihuahua, the
                            stamina of a Great Dane, and the skin of a rhinoceros.</p>

                        <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0825"/>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is considering the
                            appointment of J.V. Cruz as his Press Secretary and Blas Ople as his
                            Secretary of Labor. Both are so notoriously anti-American that their
                            consideration by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            difficult to understand.</p>
                        <p>—Recently, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> indicated a
                            reluctance to announce our agreement to provide equipment for 5 more
                            engineering construction battalions. This is a complete turnabout on his
                            part and his explanation of it is unconvincing.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was adamantly uncooperative
                            on the Clifford-Taylor visit, which simply would not have caused him as
                            much political difficulty as he pretends.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me evident that something is going on in Manila or in
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' own mind which we do
                            not understand. Whatever it is, it is already creating substantial
                            problems for us. I have talked to the people in State about this and
                            they are hoping that Bill Blair's imminent return to Manila will
                            precipitate an Embassy assessment of the difficulty. <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName>, however, is somewhat crippled
                            by a lameduck status.</p>

                            Manila a new ambassador. I think we need one even more than we had

                        <p>I do not find it very helpful. Basically, they are saying that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is worrying about his political
                            image and is therefore being stand-offish with us. But he is more
                            concerned with the Presidential election two years hence than he is with
                            the imminent congressional elections. If he is coming to believe that
                            his good relationship with us is a political liability, that is a very
                            worrisome thing, indeed, and has implications that run far beyond
                            November.</p>
                        <p>The airgram says that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> thinks
                            he can use the left-wingers and ultra-nationalists by keeping them close
                            to him. Perhaps. But he certainly knows that he cannot keep them close

                            he is considering a move to the left in domestic politics, he is
                            considering a new tone, and perhaps a new substance in his relations
                            with the U.S.</p>

                            “Barefoot” Sanders, Joseph Califano, and Michael Mantoes) met with the
                            Democratic Congressional leadership for a breakfast meeting lasting from
                            8:36 to 9:35 a.m. on September 19, 1967. The discussion related
                            primarily to domestic legislation and politics. At the beginning of the
                            meeting, Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mike Mansfield</persName>
                            reported on his recent Asian trip and stated that “the Philippines are
                            on the upgrade. They are doing a good job. They expect to get control of
                            the Senate and <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is doing a
                            good job.” Speaker of the House Carl Albert asked <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> about “Huk activity in the
                            Philippines.” <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> responded,
                            “there is not much.” Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> then asked if <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> talked to <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> about civic action groups and engineer
                            battalions. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ1">Mansfield</persName> replied,
                            “yes, but most of the time was spent talking about rice, production,
                            graft, corruption, and cleaning up the local situation.” The President
                            remarked that he was “glad to hear that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was friendly, because he had heard bad reports.”

                        <p>In a private conversation with Philippine President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, he said to me:</p>
                        <p>A. When he was promised in the U.S. equipment for five engineering
                            battalions then, and probably five later, this was intended to mean new
                            battalions and was not to include the three battalions which had
                            previously been equipped by the U.S. This was made clear in private
                            conversation between him and you.</p>
                        <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0828"/>
                        <p>B. Later the U.S. Government took the position that the first five
                            battalions to be equipped included the three previously equipped so that
                            new equipment for only two, not five, was secured.</p>
                        <p>C. He has been embarrassed by this but has “covered up” publicly,
                            indicating the U.S. has furnished the equipment. When Speaker Laurel
                            assailed the U.S. in Assembly, claiming Philippines “short-changed,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> told him to stop his
                            criticism, that perhaps equipment was not then available.</p>
                        <p>D. He feels you are not aware of the situation and that misunderstanding
                            developed at other levels. He has considered writing you a personal
                            letter, but preferred for me to get word to you. He wants to know what
                            happened.</p>
                        <p>I told President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> I had no
                            information about the matter, but would try to find out.</p>
                        <p>I discussed the history of the first five battalions with U.S. Charge
                            d'Affaires in Manila, Jim Wilson. He said:</p>
                        <p>A. At the time of the agreement there were three U.S. equipped
                            engineering battalions in the Philippines. These were not “engineering
                            construction” battalions, which take far more heavy equipment than plain
                            “engineering” battalions.</p>
                        <p>B. Our Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group Chief and Philippine Chief of
                            Staff had gone over equipment lists prior to your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and had agreed on what was
                            necessary for five “engineering construction” battalions. This was
                            furnished in full, but the equipment furnished consisted of a) full
                            equipment for two new battalions; b) construction equipment necessary to
                            convert the three plain engineering battalions into three engineering
                            construction battalions.</p>
                        <p>C. So far as Wilson knows, the agreement with respect to the first 5
                            battalions as then understood by Philippine military chiefs, was an
                            agreement to furnish 2 completely new construction engineering
                            battalions and to upgrade the 3 existing plain engineering battalions to
                            construction engineering battalions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> had explained all this some
                            months ago to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Romualdez</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' brother-in-law, but the Embassy cannot be sure
                            whether or not <persName corresp="#p_RBK1">Romualdez</persName> in fact
                            explained it in full to President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, although, subsequently, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> had stated publicly he was
                            satisfied that the commitment had been met.</p>
                        <p>It may be that President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            mistakenly believes that the original 3 battalions remained the same and
                            that he only received equipment for 2 new battalions. Or it may be he
                            recognizes the facts, but believes the agreement was to leave the 3
                            original battalions as plain engineering battalions and to fully equip 5
                            new and additional construction engineering <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0829"/>battalions. He did not mention any difference between
                            plain engineering battalions and construction engineering battalions and
                            I doubt that he recognizes that these distinctions figured in the
                            arrangement. I believe he feels simply that he started with 3 equipped
                            battalions, that he was to get 5 more, which makes 8, and that he ended
                            with 5 and was therefore “short-changed”.</p>
                        <p>I believe President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> resents
                            what he believes was a failure of the U.S. to live up to an agreement he
                            thinks he made personally with you. I believe we should correct the
                            mistake if one has been made, or explain the fact to President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> personally if his understanding
                            is wrong. I am sure President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> expects me to take this up personally and
                            directly with you and it is possible that no one in his own government
                            knows he spoke to me about this, as he did so privately, even though
                            numerous of his Cabinet Ministers and U.S. Charge
                                <persName>Wilson</persName> were waiting in an adjoining room
                            presumably to discuss other matters with him and me.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> also discussed
                            several other matters with me which are covered in detail in Manila
                                3760.<note n="4" xml:id="d357fn4">See <ref target="#d358">Document
                                    358</ref>.</note> The most important was the sending of
                            additional help to Vietnam. The President will introduce the new
                            appropriation for <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> after the
                            elections are over. He will also give additional help. He cannot
                            politically send troops, and I told him I was sure we could not pay for
                            an Operation Brotherhood in Vietnam, which was his choice (additional
                            to, not in place of, <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>). I
                            believe we can get one, or perhaps even more, Army engineering
                            battalions (which General Westmoreland prefers to another <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss>), for which he will seek
                            appropriations in the Assembly, if we build for him some roads in the
                            Clark Field area which could, in his opinion, be justified by military
                            considerations. He believes the roads would benefit Clark Field and also
                            increase mobility in the Huk Territory. Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> is coming to Vietnam on the 29th,
                            at which time I hope to have detailed discussions between him and

                        </p>
                        <p>You will be receiving promptly a message from Ambassador LOCKE to the
                            President regarding “misunderstanding” about equipment for Philippine
                            army construction battalions. Think you will wish to reassure President
                            that this matter not as critical as might seem at first blush.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> talked with me about same
                            matter. I assured him that I would look into it on return to Washington
                            but I thought there had been no reference to “new” battalions. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had said we would
                            supply equipment for five battalions this year and would consider doing
                            same for five next year. We had done both. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> seemed fully satisfied that we would check in
                            good faith and did not push question. Certainly there is no
                            “misunderstanding” on part of Americans or Filipinos who worked out
                            details of the equipment deal. In my opinion, President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is (1) looking for excuse for not
                            doing more for us in Vietnam; (2) on edge because of rough political
                            campaign underway here; (3) possibly feeling us out on whether equipment
                            for another three battalions may not be in the cards. Assure you this is
                            not of such urgency that it cannot wait until my return. President said
                            he wanted to see me again before departure and if that works out I will
                            do all possible to reassure him as to facts.</p>
                        <p>You will of course wish to ascertain whether our President's recollection
                            of this agrees with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> concept
                            which might have developed in private talk. But ensuing negotiations
                            between Filipinos and U.S. strongly supports view that understanding was
                            as described above.</p>
                        <p>Separate message from Locke through State channel describes other aspects
                            of his talk with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>He is right: Combat troops probably not politically possible—except as
                            element of U.S. forces and that has obvious drawbacks. On basis of
                            “volunteers” for U.S. forces we could probably get two divisions, but
                            that has “mercenary” flavor and other deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>If we play our cards right, another Philippine Civic Action Group or
                            engineering battalion is possible. In my opinion, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would accept some compromise that
                            would recognize his political problems and our common needs.</p>
                        <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0831"/>
                        <p>He badly needs some kind of regular briefing on situation in
                            Vietnam—including growing evidence of problems on the other side. Jim
                            Wilson agrees this would be desirable and hope something can be worked
                            out with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE6">Bunker</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>. A monthly
                            visit to Manila by Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, J–2 would be
                            valuable, with possible occasional visit by <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Regarding reference discussions with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> on this matter (paragraph 5 of cable to
                                State),<note n="7" xml:id="d357fn7">See <ref target="#d357fn5">footnote 5</ref> above.</note> this is not the best way to
                            approach matter. Any serious talk about this should be done in Manila or
                            Washington, preferably former. We will get nowhere on this unless it is
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and his Defense
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Talk of U.S. construction contractors is a non-starter, road building is
                            one thing Filipinos are doing very well on their own.</p>
                        <p>Take paragraph on Huks with a grain of salt. There are other reasons for
                            not cracking down.</p>
                        <p>I have been operating on assumption that full report on my return on
                            experiences here and Vietnam and observations thereon was preferred
                            course. If you wish fuller report on these matters earlier, please
                            inform. This has been damn profitable trip. Regards.</p>

                        <p>I had an over 2-hour private talk with Philippine President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> on Sunday, October 22. No one

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> intends to secure

                        <p>With respect to Vietnam, help from the Philippines, in addition to

                        <p>B. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> suggested an
                            “Operation Brotherhood” similar to the Laos Operation as an addition to
                            the existing Philippine Civic Action Group. He did not mention the De

                                carry out rural reconstruction and refugee settlement work, the

                        </p>
                        <p>C. I indicated this is not feasible because: (1) It does not fulfill the
                            U.S. need for further troop participation from Asian countries; (2) It
                            is a civilian-aid type project, which would require the cooperation,
                            approval and greater involvement of the Government of Vietnam; and (3)
                            It is an <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-financed project, and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is having trouble financing our
                            own projects in Vietnam without taking on anything new.</p>
                        <p>D. The most likely projects appeared to be: (1) Another Philippine Civic
                            Action Group or (2) Army engineering battalions divorced from a civic
                            action concept which could build roads, bridges, etc. Military
                            Assistance Command in Vietnam would prefer a combat battalion to another
                            Philippine Civic Action Group. Therefore, I pushed the idea of an
                            engineering battalion to guard, build, maintain roads, etc., but did not
                            use word “combat” to describe battalion. This strategy is a product of a
                            long briefing session with Embassy Manila the previous night, it being
                            thought the word “combat” might kill the idea before it started. I made
                            it clear we wanted an “army” battalion.</p>
                        <p>E. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would not have money to
                            finance, and would not want us to finance directly because of possible
                            charges of our hiring “mercenaries.” He thought it might be possible if
                            we financed indirectly by financing work in the Philippines which
                            otherwise he would have to finance.</p>
                        <p>F. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said he would study the
                            matter. I made it plain I could not commit the U.S. and that our
                            discussion was only an attempt to find possible solutions for our mutual
                            problems that were at least worthy of his study and of my submission to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0833"/>
                        <p>The following morning I had a discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> and De Venecia. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> and Secretary of Defense Mata had
                            a talk with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> at
                            length after I left. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> said:</p>
                        <p>A. The President is agreeable, in principle, to the army engineering
                            battalion concept and also to sending engineering specialists as
                            “observers.”</p>
                        <p>B. The President is prepared to seek an appropriation for this purpose if
                            we will build certain roads near Clark Field.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> said these would have the
                            military value of (1) speeding up traffic between Clark Field and
                            Manila; (2) extending roads into Huk territory, thus helping the
                            government deal with the Huks. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> mentioned a diversionary road north of Clark to
                            relieve traffic. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> had
                            mentioned the Clark to Subic Bay route.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> will be in Saigon
                            for the Thieu inauguration. He will come armed with maps and details of
                            roads. I will have General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName> come up with the nuts and bolts of the
                            desired battalions. The plan is for General <persName corresp="#p_WWC1">Westmoreland</persName>, or perhaps his appropriate staff man,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>, and me to discuss the
                            details and costs October 29 in Saigon.<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d357fn5">footnote 5, Document 357</ref>.</note> I discussed this with Embassy
                            Manila which was agreeable. If the matter proceeds to the proper point,
                            discussions will then naturally shift to Embassy Manila and to various
                            appropriate Philippine officials after the elections. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> is informed I cannot make a
                            commitment and the present stage is one of discussion only.</p>
                        <p>Other matters discussed by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            were:</p>
                        <p>A. A Japanese agreement to finance part of the projected new road system.
                            The Japanese Prime Minister will send Japanese private contractors to
                            Manila to negotiate construction contracts. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> did not mention an amount, but De Venecia had
                            previously mentioned $60,000,000 and this was confirmed by the
                            newspapers.</p>
                        <p>B. The <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> desire that United
                            States contractors come to Manila to negotiate construction contracts
                            for roads. He said he would guarantee them there would be no
                            under-the-table payoffs, the fear of which he believes has prevented
                            U.S. contractors from being interested in the past. (This statement he
                            also made in front of a group of his Ministers and U.S. Charge
                            d'Affaires <persName>Wilson</persName> with whom he discussed some
                            matters in my presence after our private talk.) I told him I would
                            inform Washington of his desires. I was thinking the Department of
                            Commerce might be interested. I also suggested that through the
                            Philippine Bank or the Philippine Embassy in the U.S., he could probably
                            get information on road contractors in the Federal Highway System and
                            Dunn and Bradstreet reports on those interested. I surmise one of his
                            interests <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0834"/>in U.S. contractors
                            is that they might make it easier to finance his road program. I
                            understand U.S. contractors would have to take Philippine contractors as
                            joint venturers and that the Philippine Bank guarantees might be
                            available for highly qualified and reputable companies.</p>
                        <p>C. The <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> desire that U.S.
                            Armed Forces at Clark conduct a civil action program to help hamlets in
                            the area. This is to be part of anti-Huk work and part of a program to
                            improve the U.S. image, as “good work done” stories could be leaked to
                            the press. He is thinking of help with farm roads, irrigation ditches,
                            schools—small and scattered work—a completely U.S. program. (I
                            understand from Embassy Manila such a program is now contemplated.)</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> said the Huks in the
                            provinces are known and could be picked up but are connected with
                            intellectuals in Manila whom he wished to identify first. The Huks are
                            now supporting political candidates, and he is supporting the best
                            candidates to oppose them without reference to party lines. Candidates
                            deny a connection with the Huks or that they seek Huk support, and he
                            has told them that if they get elected and help the Huks, he will clamp
                            down. The Huks infiltrated guards at Clark, necessitating his using the
                            constabulary to guard the base. Also some accommodation with lower army
                            echelons, necessitating his change of army units in the area. Also some
                            Huks have had M–16 weapons.</p>
                        <p>E. Discussion was held of the situation in Vietnam (I said progress is
                            being made in all respects), of peace negotiations (I said no sign of
                            change in attitude by Hanoi) of the importance of Vietnam to all Asia
                            (he agreed, and said all Asian leaders agreed. He said even <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had told him he was glad of
                            the U.S. presence in Asia and that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> claimed he was “using” the Communists). It is
                            possible, if Washington thinks it useful, that he might be willing to
                            start a movement toward negotiation for a limited purpose of prisoner
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving Vietnam, I had discussed various proposals with the
                            Military Assistance Command in Vietnam, Civil Operations for
                            Revolutionary Development, and the Agency for International Development
                            for Philippines help in technical and civilian fields. I did not discuss
                            these with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            because I did not want to confuse the engineering battalion issue. De
                            Venecia thinks it important to have the civilian “mix” with the military
                            aid. Probably this will come up when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> comes to Vietnam. I will send a
                            separate message about this.</p>
                        <p>So far, there have been no press leaks. The President's lunch at the
                            Palace was very small, and included U.S. Charge Wilson and his wife. The
                            only sizeable party (about 50) was given by Secretary and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> and Mrs. Perez (widow of former
                            House Speaker and mother-in-law of <hi rend="italic">De Venecia</hi>) at
                            Mrs. Perez' home. Presumably, only <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0835"/>friends of the government were invited and they were
                            not necessarily told of the Presidential invitation.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                        <p>By now you will have had a chance to digest Eugene Locke's two messages,
                            our 3760<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">See <ref target="#d358">Document
                                    358</ref>.</note> and his back channel direct to the White
                                House,<note n="3" xml:id="d359fn3">Attachment A to <ref target="#d357">Document 357</ref>.</note> which I assume has
                            been passed on to you, regarding <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' assertion that he was short changed on the
                            original five ECB's. I trust that Bill Jorden's accompanying back
                            channel to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d359fn4">Attachment B to <ref target="#d357">Document 357</ref>.</note> served its intended purpose of
                            calming any immediate reactions at the highest levels at home.</p>
                        <p>The LOCKE messages do record, however, this rather extraordinary and
                            curious play by <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>; and some
                            personal observations from here may be in order aside from any direct
                            comment we send in on 3760—particularly since open comments on LOCKE's
                            back channel message are a bit difficult under the circumstance.</p>
                        <p>First of all with respect to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' <gloss target="#t_ECB1">ECB</gloss> allegation, I
                            find it very difficult to believe that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in fact does not know the whole story on <gloss target="#t_ECB1">ECB</gloss> numerology. To assert at this late date
                            in the face of well documented past history that he was talking five (or
                            ten) new battalions over and above his original three engineering
                            battalions simply won't wash. There is a very remote chance, as he
                            implied to LOCKE, that this came up in his private conversation with the
                            President in September 1966 of which no one has a record. (This is the
                            real reason <hi rend="italic">Locke</hi> used that particular back
                            channel to report it.) But I doubt seriously that anything in that
                            detail would have been discussed.</p>
                        <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0836"/>
                        <p>Beyond this we have all sorts of evidence to indicate the contrary. I
                            start with your own report of your February 1966 conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> (Embtels 1792 and 1793
                            of February 26, 1966)<note n="5" xml:id="d359fn5">Both dated February
                                26. (National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central

                                S)</note> in which you made it plain <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was then talking seven battalions in addition to
                            his existing three. This conforms exactly with the discussions going on
                            then between us, Mata, Raquizo and others as set forth in the attached
                            summary briefing paper we drew up here last June when the allegation was
                            first made that we were short changing them.<note n="6" xml:id="d359fn6">Not attached and not found.</note> You will note in particular the
                            attached schedule of battalion activation utilizing the original three
                            as cadre for a total of ten battalions. This formed an integral part of
                            the May 18, 1966 agreement between JUSMAG and the DND. The summary
                            briefing paper and the chart were given both to Kokoy Romualdez and to
                            Salas to show to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in June.
                            We can only assume they did what they said they were going to, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> certainly understood
                            the situation last June.</p>
                        <p>This being the case I can only conclude that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has chosen to use this rather elaborate method to
                            bring to the President's attention through Locke that he really wants
                            equipment for three more <gloss target="#t_ECB1">ECB</gloss>'s as part
                            of the asking price for any augmentation of Phil forces in Vietnam, the
                            other elements—as of now—being the Subic-Clark road, the Clark by-pass
                            road and a right of way through Clark for the latter.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Subic-Clark we are trying to dig out more background but
                            believe this harks back to the Pablo Roman scheme of several years ago
                            (participated in then by our friend De Venecia) which was abandoned when
                            our military decided to build the Clark-Subic pipeline. The other road,
                            as proposed by Melchor, the Pentagon is now presumably looking at. The
                            Clark right of way they probably want under any circumstances and may
                            thus be a separable element in the package.</p>
                        <p>No one of course in the absence of actual feasibility studies has any
                            real idea of the price tag on either of the roads. Even Melchor's figure
                            seems to be only a wild guess. The U.S. contractor bit, I suspect, is
                            simply thrown in as a sweetening ploy to make it look as if they were
                            concerned with our dollar outflow problem and to suggest indirectly the
                            possibility of <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EX–IM</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> financing. It seems from a practical
                            standpoint to be a non-starter. What they would undoubtedly like is
                            something approaching the arrangements they have probably heard of in
                            Northeast Thailand, where <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> picks up
                            the tab on certain roads on the basis of U.S. military requirements.
                            Beyond this and as successive fall off positions I imagine they would
                            like us to pick up at least dollar <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0837"/>costs on whatever roads might be eventually agreed upon
                            as part of the quid pro quo arrangement.</p>
                        <p>All this being said, I am still trying to analyze why <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> chose this particular means to
                            surface his proposals. The De Venecia proposals clearly were nothing
                            more than a cover for <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' own
                            independent move. (All the cabinet members who sat around with me while
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> talked to LOCKE in the
                            next room were armed incidentally with De Venecia's 30 page briefing
                            book covering his projects, none of which were even mentioned.) The
                            methodology is of course typical of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, but why he went to such lengths on this
                            including the elaborate hospitality showered on the Lockes remains
                            something of a puzzle.</p>
                        <p>One guess is that he harbors some idea that LOCKE might be the next
                            Ambassador here (Kokoy mentioned this possibility to Rafferty) and
                            wanted to look him over. Or <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            might be using this to signal the idea that he would prefer to do
                            business with a new Ambassador who is close to the throne at home<note n="7" xml:id="d359fn7">Before Dallas lawyer Eugene Locke was
                                Ambassador to Pakistan and then Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam, he was
                                Chairman of the Texas Democratic Committee.</note> in order to
                            continue the same sort of personal diplomacy he tried with Kokoy in
                            Washington. It's even possible he had in his mind a bit of a reverse
                            nudge in terms of having us look over Elizalde to see if he would have
                            the same kind of personal access to our President that he would like to
                            see here.</p>
                        <p>This is of course only speculation, but with a fellow as complex as
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> almost anything is
                            possible. I doubt if he would go to all the trouble to getting LOCKE
                            over here just to tell him about the <gloss target="#t_ECB1">ECB</gloss>'s, since he told <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> the same thing the same day, and the rest of it
                            could very easily have been handled with Bill Blair before he left, with
                            me, or by private letter to the President. I need hardly add that from
                            the standpoint of my own future relations here in the inter regnum I
                            trust that the replies to all of these queries come back to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> through normal Embassy channels.
                            We will of course keep in close touch with Saigon on any developments
                            there, and I've also made it a point to keep Bill Jorden fully read into
                            this here. He will undoubtedly be in touch with you on it shortly after
                            he gets back.</p>

                        <p>On Saturday, November 4, 1967, at 2:20 p.m. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, Press Secretary George
                            Christian, and Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_JJRJ1">Jim
                                Jones</persName> for a luncheon meeting. The lunch took place in the
                            West Sitting Room of the White House. In the early part of the meeting,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked if Eugene
                            Locke could fill the post of Ambassador to the Philippines (Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWMCJ1">Blair</persName> had left on October
                            24). The President expressed worry about the Philippines, stating, “I
                            feel it in my bones that there is going to be a problem there.” The
                            President remarked that he trusted LOCKE, but perhaps he was too close
                            to the President to be placed in the position of Ambassador to the
                            Philippines. The remainder of the conversation, which lasted until 3:55
                            p.m., did not relate to the Philippines. (Memorandum from

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The recent electoral successes of his Nacionalista Party have left
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in a strong
                            political position after two years in office. Increased control at both
                            national and provincial levels should enable him to make greater
                            progress in his reform and development programs if he is so
                            inclined.</p>
                        <p>The problems he faces are serious ones, however, involving the strains of
                            rural poverty and urban unemployment, rising lawlessness, and growing
                            pressures from an emerging generation alienated from the tradition of
                            their parents and seeking a more distinct national identity. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' willingness and ability to
                            overcome the foot-dragging of a powerful conservative oligarchy and to
                            satisfy some of the demands of increasing nationalism will have an
                            important effect on his political future.</p>

                        <p>1. After two years in office, President Fernando Marcos of the
                            Philippines has shown remarkable political strength, as reflected in the
                            success of his Nacionalista Party in the recent off-year elections.<note n="2" xml:id="d362fn2">

                                Based on 90 percent of election returns, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> concluded that “the election was marred by

                                program and is another step toward his goal of re-election in 1969.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> campaigned vigorously for
                            Nacionalista candidates for local and provincial positions, realizing
                            that grass-roots support would be vital both in implementing his
                            development programs and in marshalling support for his bid for
                            re-election in 1969. His efforts were repaid when, according to
                            unofficial returns, his party gained 48 out of 65 governorships and <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0840"/>nearly three fourths of other
                            provincial, municipal, and local offices in elections marred by
                            violence, corruption, and inefficiency. In the Senate, whose members are
                            elected at large, the Nacionalistas took six of the eight contested
                            seats, and a pro-administration independent gained a seventh, leaving
                            the opposition Liberals with just one Senate victory.</p>
                        <p>2. The glow of victory was somewhat dimmed by the outstanding showing of
                            the Liberal senatorial candidate, Benigro Aquino, ex-governor of Tarlac
                            Province and a vigorous opponent of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, and by the re-election of Manila's Liberal
                            mayor, Antonio Villegas, whose penchant for anti-American nationalism
                            has often proved embarrassing to the administration. As <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> had personally chosen and
                            vigorously campaigned for Villegas' opponent, the mayor's victory was
                            particularly galling.</p>
                        <p>3. The elections have left <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            with increased numerical support both in the provinces and in the
                            legislature (the Senate now includes 15 Nacionalistas, seven Liberals,
                            one Nationalist Citizens Party member, and one independent), which
                            should put him in a better position to carry out the reform sures and
                            development programs the country so desperately needs. The highly
                            centralized nature of the Philippine Government will facilitate the
                            President's control over his provincial adherents. His ability to
                            control the legislature, however, is less certain. Philippine
                            politicians have traditionally switched allegiance when they believed it
                            was to their political advantage. The Liberals, for example, gained
                            control of the Senate last January through the defection of four
                            Nacionalista senators. Obligations incurred in the recent election, as
                            well as attempts to ensure future backing for his re-election bid, may
                            also diminish <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' enthusiasm
                            for pushing through reform legislation, a subject which—in any case—is
                            not popular with the generally conservative oligarchy that controls
                            Philippines politics. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            primary goal, above all else, is to be the first Philippine president to
                            be re-elected, and he can be expected to make any political compromises
                            to achieve this end.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Nation's Problems</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is still faced with the
                            myriad of troubles that beset the country when he was elected and has so
                            far accomplished rather little in resolving them. A vast and growing gap
                            exists between the wealth of the few and the poverty of the many. The
                            peasant farmer's subsistence-level existence has been perpetuated by
                            backward agricultural methods, inadequate irrigation, and high loss from
                            uncontrolled pests, particularly in the important rice-growing areas.
                            Initiative for improvements has been discouraged by a feudalistic system
                            of land tenure and by a traditional suspicion of innovation. Progress in
                            land reform and rural development has been generally slow, hampered both
                            by bureaucratic inefficiency and by the interference of landlords who
                            are powerful supporters of both major parties.</p>
                        <pb n="803" xml:id="pg_803" facs="0841"/>
                        <p>5. Because of unsatisfactory standards of living in rural areas,
                            migration to urban areas, especially Manila, has expanded rapidly in
                            recent years. The rapidly growing urban populations have intensified
                            pressures on municipal facilities and services, which are unable to keep
                            pace with the expanding slums. Even though a growing economy is
                            providing increased opportunities, it has not kept pace with a rapidly
                            increasing population. Serious unemployment and more widespread
                            under-employment have resulted. Despite this vast reserve of labor, the
                            demand for skilled manpower to meet growing industrial needs cannot be
                            met. Government neglect in providing training schools or in encouraging
                            technical education has only recently been recognized, and manpower
                            planning and technical training programs have begun to receive
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>6. Efforts to institute the necessary reforms have been undercut by
                            corruption, inefficiency, and nepotism in the political structure.
                            Public office continues to be used to further personal or family
                            fortunes. An official dispenses jobs and favors, not in the public
                            interest, but to satisfy obligations to those people tied to him through
                            the complex familial or patronal relationships that characterize
                            Philippine society. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>,
                            himself, is partly responsible for the continuing inefficiency by his
                            desire to maintain tight personal control over the government's
                            activities and his reluctance to entrust even minor decision-making to
                            subordinates. His veto of the decentralization bill, which would have
                            allowed much-needed flexibility and initiative at the local level, was a
                            reflection of this need to control the game.</p>

                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' initial program to
                            initiate development, fight lawlessness, and suppress smuggling and
                            corruption met with only limited success. Perhaps having lost some of
                            his taste for jousting with the powerful figures involved, he has
                            narrowed his efforts to emphasize “rice, roads, and schools” as the
                            major goals of his administration. The Philippines' need to import five
                            to ten percent of its rice requirements each year has been a serious
                            drain on foreign exchange. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            goal of achieving self-sufficiency in rice will hopefully be fulfilled
                            by 1970 by means of an intensive program to introduce the improved
                            strain of rice, IR–8. With the receipt of US equipment for five
                            additional army engineering construction battalions, bringing the total
                            army engineering strength to eight battalions, the government launched a
                            vigorous road construction program, which by last June had completed
                            some 700 kilometers of new roadway. The school building project has also
                            received considerable US assistance through the Special Fund for
                            Education and is progressing “satisfactorily.”</p>
                        <p>8. Central Luzon has been a special target for the government's de-
                            velopment efforts. Operation Central Luzon (later called the Central

                            launched to undercut the growing influence of the pro-Communist Huks in
                            this traditionally depressed area. There is no indication that any
                            serious impact has been made on the poverty and injustices of life
                            there, although increased rice production may stimulate some
                            improvement, and the power of the Huks has not been curbed.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> prepared Intelligence Notes for
                                Rusk on the Huks/Peoples Liberation Army at the midterm election. In
                                Note 830, October 18, INR suggested that <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would not move militarily against the Huks
                                until after the presidential elections of 1969 or even the off-year
                                elections of 1971 because he needed their political support at the
                                local level in Central Luzon. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 PHIL) In Note 850, October 26, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> analyzed Huk political power in
                                central and western Luzon and concluded that by running its own
                                candidates in most races it would prove the difference between
                                defeat or victory. <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> suggested
                                that Huk political influence would grow after the elections. (Ibid.,
                                    <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 14 PHIL)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. Huk influence is sustained in part by the collaboration of local
                            officials and politicians who recognize the Huk ability to control the
                            vote, in great part through intimidation. To some extent, the Huks have
                            also been able to project a Robin Hood image among peasants disgruntled
                            over bad government and impoverishment. The recent elections served to
                            stimulate their activities and probably helped to solidify their
                            position. The estimated number of armed Huks is still a relatively
                            modest 140. However, these are supported by up to 30,000 sympathizers.
                            Insurgent operations continue to center on the provinces of Tarlac and
                            Pampanga, and reported efforts to expand to other areas have apparently
                            been unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has vacillated between a
                            harsh line against the insurgents and vague gestures of amnesty. The
                            President's support of the constabulary's efforts against the Huks has
                            been inconsistent, but just prior to the recent election he encouraged
                            the constabulary to intensify its effort. Several Huk leaders were
                            either captured or killed, but these successes may result in Huk
                            reprisals. Particularly distressing has been the evidence of M–16 rifles
                            in Huk possession. It remains to be seen how long <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> will sustain the pressure, but
                            his electoral successes and a recent, particularly daring Huk ambush are
                            reported to have prompted him to order the constabulary to redouble its
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>11. Little is known of the strength of Communist ideology in the present
                            Huk movement, but their ties with the urban-based remnants of the
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKP1">PKP</gloss>) appear tenuous.
                            Although there have been meetings between the urban leftist leaders and
                            the Huk commanders, the pro-Communist urban fronts have also made
                            attempts to develop a rural following independent of the Huks, most
                            notably through the peasant front, the Masaka (Free Farmers
                            Association). The growth of this organization, still in its incipient
                            stages, might ultimately provide a better <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805" facs="0843"/>indication than the Huks of the Communists' ability to
                            exploit rural poverty and unrest. These urban fronts, however, are
                            themselves in a weakened and divided stage. Continually splintering into
                            overlapping or competing groups, they presently are engaged in an
                            internal struggle between the older, pro-Soviet cadre and the younger,
                            Peking-oriented radicals. Lacking discipline, forceful leadership, and
                            funds, they represent no current threat to the government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Radical Nationalists</p>
                        <p>12. A more serious problem is the pressure from the radical nationalists,
                            particularly in the younger generation, who seek to cultivate a more
                            Asian identity and resent any overtones of American
                            domination—political, economic, or cultural. These younger Filipinos,
                            who make up an increasing percentage of the electorate, do not share the
                            sentimental ties to the US that many of their parents still have and are
                            resentful of any indication of what they believe to be American
                            paternalism or privileges. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            apparent lack of interest in establishing support with this group has
                            been puzzling. Despite his obvious political nerve, he has neither
                            seriously attempted to bid for their support nor tried to channel their
                            excessive national pride into useful directions. When <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has dealt with the young radical
                            intellectuals at all, it has been in indirect attempts to undercut their
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>13. US military bases and economic relations are the usual targets of
                            nationalistic frustrations; the government's actions occasionally
                            reflect its sensitivity to these pressures. Most Philippine leaders
                            readily acknowledge the necessity of the American bases and their
                            importance to Philippine security, but the desire to be accepted in the
                            Asian community and a sensitivity to charges of American dominance cause
                            underlying tensions which occasionally erupt. Sporadic assertions of
                            sovereignty take the form of disputes over jurisdictional rights, labor,
                            natural resources, or the administration of customs, immigration, and
                            health regulations on bases.</p>
                        <p>14. Economic nationalism has been manifested primarily in the persistent
                            attacks on the Laurel-Langley agreement, viewed by the radical
                            nationalists as economic imperialism. Preliminary talks regarding future
                            arrangements after the agreement expires in 1974 have already shown the
                            Philippine desire for a protected position in the American market but an
                            unwillingness to allow reciprocal preferences. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has always been aware of the
                            Philippines' need for foreign investment and has sought to attract it,
                            but he has also been periodically stymied by the maneuverings of the
                            nationalists, as during Mayor Villegas' attack earlier this year on
                            American retail trade in the Manila area. As presidential elections loom
                            on the horizon, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> may find it
                            politically expedient to take a harsher line toward future economic
                            ties.</p>
                        <pb n="806" xml:id="pg_806" facs="0844"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Associations</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has often shown a
                            sensitivity to criticism of too close an association with the US. He has
                            justified his support for the American position in Vietnam and for the
                            Philippine contribution to the war effort by citing the resulting
                            American aid for his domestic development programs. In his desire to
                            establish his identity as an Asian statesman, independent of American
                            control, he has attempted to initiate peace proposals that have only
                            served to arouse the annoyance and mistrust of his Asian allies. This
                            striving for an independent image has also involved a growing interest
                            in developing trade and cultural ties with Eastern Europe, but the
                            government has been cautious in pursuing them. Prominent Filipinos have
                            visited bloc countries in increasing numbers, though without official
                            recognition. China, however, is still viewed with great alarm, and
                            contact has been very limited. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> continues to regard the American presence in Asia
                            as absolutely vital, but publicly acknowledges this less frequently.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects</p>
                        <p>16. In general, the Philippines situation reflects the inability of a
                            rural, agricultural economy, feudalistically structured, to support a
                            rapidly expanding population, and the failure of a slowly expanding
                            industrial sector to meet job requirements for increasing urban masses.
                            The problem facing any Philippine government is, in some way, to
                            persuade or manipulate the conservative elite to accept the political
                            and economic reforms necessary to stimulate the economy. Unless the
                            peasant farmer and the urban slum dweller are persuaded that the present
                            system can respond to their needs, their growing apathy could in time
                            turn to rebellion. As the post-war generation becomes more prominent on
                            the scene, the government must also respond to growing nationalist
                            pressures, which will probably involve loosening traditional ties with
                            the US in the search for a distinctive identity.</p>

                            The Malaysian government has known since May 1967 through its own
                            intelligence service that the Philippines was involved in preparing a
                            program for infiltration and subversion in Sabah in support of the
                            Philippine claim there. Early in December, Malaysia learned that
                            Philippine guerrillas were being trained in the southern Philippines.
                            While top Malaysian officials were incensed that an ostensibly friendly
                            country and a fellow member of the recently created Association of
                            Southeast Asian Nations would plot to subvert a part of their territory,
                            they were confident that their own security forces could repel any
                            Philippine subversion effort and that the political situation in Sabah
                            was not susceptible to Philippine influence. The Malaysians hoped that,
                            by quietly making known their awareness of the Philippine plans, they
                            could persuade the Philippine government to drop the project, thus
                            preventing any rupture in Philippine-Malaysian relations.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Malaysia's Formal Protest to the Philippines</hi>. The
                            unexpected revelation of the secret Philippine training program at
                            Corregidor, which was given wide publicity in the Philippines and
                            Malaysia coincident with the arrest of twenty armed Filipinos attempting

                            must take formal if low-key notice of the Philippine program. On March

                            was handed to the second secretary of the Philippine Embassy by a medium
                            level official. The note stated that Malaysia took the news of the
                            Corregidor camp “most seriously in view of the recent arrest of more
                            than twenty Filipinos with arms — who were unable to explain their
                            presence in Sabah.” Malaysia would have “no alternative but to regard
                            such activities as a most serious breach of good faith and friendly
                            relations” and requested “a full explanation.” The Malaysian note also
                            said that Malaysia had instructed its representative at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to bring the matter to the attention of

                        <p>Malaysia was not reassured by Philippine reaction to its note, even
                            though Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>
                            told the Malaysian Ambassador that the Philippines was “not trying to
                            instigate a revolt in Sabah” and that the Philippines would answer the
                            Malaysian note soon “in a friendly, moderate tone.” It was clear that
                            the Philippines was annoyed that the Malaysians were reporting to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General. One Philippine
                            diplomat called this action “presumptuous” and said Malaysia was
                            elevating the issue unnecessarily. The Malaysians were further disturbed
                            when <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> insisted that the Corregidor
                            training camp had been established for counterinsurgency training
                            following reports of communist activities in Mindanao and the Sulus and
                            when Manila in its secret reply to Malaysia's note accused the
                            Malaysians of infiltrating the Philippines from Sabah. On March 25, the
                            Malaysians issued a statement demanding that, in the interests of
                            friendly relations between the two countries, the results of both
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' and the
                            Philippine Congress' investigations of the Corregidor training program
                            be made public and describe the objectives of the training.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Prospects for Philippine-Malaysian Relations</hi>. The
                            Malaysian government hopes that, having presented its low-key formal
                            protest to Manila, no further diplomatic action on its part will be
                            necessary and that it will not be pushed toward a break in diplomatic
                            relations. Its ability to maintain this policy depends, however, on the
                            Philippine diplomatic response, on Malaysian press and public reactions
                            to the further revelations that may result from the official
                            investigations of the training program, and on the reverberations
                            produced in the Philippines by these investigations.</p>

                        <p>2. the importance of the Philippine Government taking a more liberal

                            stems from his visit with you in 1966). We also plan to suspend activity
                            regarding procurement in the Philippines of our needs in Vietnam
                            (another matter stemming from the communiqué issued at the end of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' visit with you).
                            Finally, the cable raises <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0850"/>the
                            possibility that at some point the reductions of <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> might render the Philippines
                            ineligible to sit in the councils of troop-contributing countries to
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The cable has been personally cleared by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>But I have my doubts that this cable will do the job. In the first place
                            our Charge in Manila is not at all likely to go as far with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> as this cable will permit him to
                            go. The cable should serve, however, to clarify <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' intentions and precipitate a
                            dialog with our Mission on the best approach to the problem of keeping
                                <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> intact. Eventually, we
                            may want to resort to another letter from you. That, however, depends on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' reaction, and this
                            cable is a necessary first step.</p>
                        <p>One good reason for precipitating this issue without delay is to try to
                            get it out of the way before Mennen <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> arrives in Manila, in about a month.</p>
                        <p>There is one danger in this of which I think you should be aware. Thus
                            far, the reduction of <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> has
                            taken place with virtually no publicity. Manila is a sieve, and a tough
                            approach by us will probably become known and focus publicity on the
                                <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> reduction. However, that
                            is sure to happen anyway, sooner or later. I think it is time to bite
                            the bullet with the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>I recommend you approve the cable. Whether or not you approve you might
                            want to discuss the problem at the Tuesday luncheon.</p>

                                Philippines engineering unit was discussed. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> noted that the Philippines
                                could not support the unit until June and Clifford stated that the
                                Philippines wanted to reduce it from 1,800 to 1,400. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> remarked that a seventy

                                in South Vietnam. Presumably the reduction was accepted and the

                        <p>Discussion:</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, at the luncheon May 9, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName> raised the question of the
                            Philippine-Malaysian dispute over Sabah and his concern that the dispute
                            may disrupt the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> ministerial
                            meeting in August. Thanat plans to reason with both parties before the
                            bilateral talks on Sabah open in Bangkok June 17. He would like us to
                            persuade President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> to cool
                            off the quarrel. We did not at the time so inform <persName corresp="#p_TK3">Thanat</persName>, but we have told the Filipinos
                            informally, when they mentioned the issue, that we thought they should
                            quiet the matter. (See Manila 8618 and State 136076 attached at Tab
                                B.)<note n="2" xml:id="d367fn2">Both attached but neither
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>After giving the matter further thought, and discussing it with the
                            Country Directors in <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>, I believe that
                            we should continue to avoid active intervention in the Sabah dispute,
                            and to avoid initiating discussions on this issue with any of the
                            interested governments. In arriving at this conclusion, I considered the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Seriousness of Present Impasse—</hi>We expect the
                            Bangkok talks on Sabah to fail, with mutual recriminations. Malaysia
                            intends to reject the Philippine claim outright and to refuse a second
                            round of talks, even if (according to one senior Malaysian official) the
                            Philippines react by breaking diplomatic relations again. The Malaysians
                            also plan to stage a military demonstration in Sabah while the bilateral
                            talks are going on. On the Philippine side, President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is reported to have reversed the
                            moderate line urged by Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>, and the Department of Foreign Affairs is now
                            taking a “second hard look” at the relative priorities of regional
                            cooperation and the Sabah claim.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Sabah as a Southeast Asian Problem—</hi>We have
                            told both the Filipinos and the Malaysians that we consider Sabah
                            primarily a problem which they will have to work out for themselves.
                            Other members of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>, working
                            separately or jointly, may be able to help them <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0852"/>work out a face-saving compromise, or
                            to persuade them at least to try to contain the dispute in order to
                            minimize the damage to regional cooperation. I believe that advice or
                            pressure from outside powers, however well-intended, would only weaken
                            the sense of responsibility of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss>
                            members for handling their own affairs, and that at this point, we can
                            best encourage the development of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> by standing aside and letting the member states
                            decide for themselves how to deal with the potential threat posed by the
                            Sabah dispute.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">U.S.-Philippine Relations and Philippines in
                                Southeast Asia—</hi>I believe that it would be unwise especially for
                            the U.S. to attempt to guide or influence the Philippines on this issue.
                            Such a move would encourage the Filipinos' tendency to draw us into
                            their affairs and then to consider us responsible for the situation. It
                            would also reinforce the view held by other Southeast Asian nations that
                            the Philippine Government cannot be dealt with as a responsible
                            Government, but must be approached through Uncle Sam, who will keep them
                            in line. If the Philippines is to play a responsible role in Southeast
                            Asian affairs, Fililpino leaders must learn to conduct their affairs
                            without guidance from us, and to bear the consequences of their
                            mistakes.</p>

                        <p>A. The Philippine political system, despite the trappings of democracy,
                            is dominated by a wealthy and conservative oligarchy, largely
                            unresponsive to the economic and social needs of the vast bulk of the
                                population.<note n="2" xml:id="d368fn2">In a memorandum to Fred
                                Green of <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/REA, June 27, C. Hoyt
                                Price, Director of EA/PHL, argued that this <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> was “too pessimistic” and quoted from an <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> team assessment that suggested
                                that the Philippines' economy “was in better condition than it has
                                been during most of the last decade.” The 1967 growth rate was 5.6
                                percent as compared with 4.2 percent in 1966. Food production was
                                up, there was a rice surplus, and public investment projects were
                                being completed. Price suggested that since the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> assessment was so much at

                            that the remainder of his administration will be any more productive;
                            from now until the next presidential election in November 1969, both he
                            and his opponents will be increasingly preoccupied with politics to the
                            detriment of substantive programs.</p>
                        <p>B. Even over the longer term, prospects for reform of the Philippine
                            social and political apparatus do not appear promising. Although the
                            left does not pose an immediate threat, it may be able to convert
                            existing apathy and resignation into discontent and eventually active
                            opposition. Moreover, Philippine frustrations are likely to have an
                            increasingly anti-American cast.<note n="3" xml:id="d368fn3">On July 12
                                John Holdridge (<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>) prepared a
                                rejoinder to Price's June 27 memorandum which concluded that
                                “aggregate economic growth, especially when accompanied by an
                                extremely high birth rate and inequitable distribution of income is
                                an unreliable barometer of social-economic progress.” Holdridge
                                stated that there was no “evidence” that “an increase in the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> noticeably lessened the burdens of

                        <p>C. The cornerstone of <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            foreign policy is the US-Philippine alliance, which is generally
                            approved. A recent agreement has, for the time being at least, removed
                            major problems related to US military bases. Though Filipinos generally
                            are apathetic about the war in Vietnam, leaders are deeply concerned
                            that the US maintain a strong position in Asia and will, from time to
                            time, seek reassurance as to the US security commitment to their

                        <p>1. Sabah matter discussed fairly intensively between Pres <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and <persName>Bundy</persName> at
                            meeting afternoon July 24.<note n="2" xml:id="d369fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> had attended
                                the Honolulu Conference between Presidents
                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> and Thieu of South Vietnam. After
                                the conference, he visited U.S. allies in East Asia, including the
                                Philippines, for consultations. In telegram 8708 from Seoul, July
                                23, <persName>Bundy</persName> asked for advice for his meeting with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> on the Sabah
                                question. <persName>Bundy</persName> stated he was inclined to have
                                “a heart-to-heart” and recalled that Rusk had told him to “make it
                                crystal clear that if there were to be any conflict [over Sabah]
                                whatever, they [the Philippines] could count on nothing from us.”
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> proposed “to be extremely frank and
                                tough with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> alone, but
                                not to spread the word.” (Ibid.) The Department concurred in
                                telegram 20694 to Manila, July 23. (Ibid.)</note> Because of extreme
                            sensitivity this subject and speculation this conversation in particular
                            all posts should handle this report with great care. For public purposes
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> agreed with
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> that latter should adhere to absolute “no
                            comment” position throughout his trip on the whole subject of Sabah,
                            including the question whether the topic had even come up with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> or with <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> officials. Question of disclosure to friendly
                            governments addressed below for appropriate instructions and action by

                        <p>Following <persName>Bundy</persName>'s report on Honolulu meeting and
                            general status in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> himself raised the subject of
                            Sabah (setting, incidentally, was totally private, with airconditioner
                            drowning out any listening ears). <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' opening remarks made following points:</p>
                        <p>A) He noted that claim had been made before he came into office and that
                            his own party had been divided on it;</p>
                        <p>B) Nonetheless, matter had assumed major importance in the Philippines,
                            and he felt obligated to keep it alive;</p>
                        <p>C) A week before the ending of the Bangkok talks, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had thought it had understanding with <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> the talks would be ended on the
                            note that neither side had convinced the other, but that discussions
                            would continue in some form after an unspecified period of recess.
                            Unfortunately, sharp Malaysian behavior and outright rejection of claim
                            had produced situation in which his Foreign Policy Council had been
                            inclined to recommend immediate military action. He had held this off,
                            and had limited GOP reaction to withdrawal of all but one represent-
                            ative in <gloss target="#t_KL1">KL</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>D) He volunteered that he was completely opposed to any military action
                            and would indeed “take the issue to the country” if necessary to prevent
                            this. At the same time, he said that Muslim feelings in neighboring
                            areas ran high and that there might be some private raids that he could
                            not control;</p>
                        <p>E) In conclusion, he expressed the hope that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could act to produce “more civil” attitude by <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>, again making clear that he felt major
                            need to keep the issue alive and at least apparently under serious
                            discussion. He also mentioned <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>, but
                            without pressing it.</p>
                        <p>2. In reply, <persName>Bundy</persName> made following points:</p>
                        <p>A) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had not been, and would not become
                            involved in dispute on either side. We took no position on the merits of
                            the claim or on responsibility for the breakup of the Bangkok talks. We
                            felt it essential to adhere to this position. (At the same time,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> remarked that when claim had first been
                            raised, he had expressed clear private views on it—unstated but clearly
                            implied to be negative—but would not do so in present circumstances. He
                            also noted that there was “widespread impression” that closing phases of
                            Bangkok talks had been affected by the “rather crisp” presentation of
                            Ambassador Guerrero. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            obviously took in both points, but did not pursue them.);</p>
                        <p>B) At the same time, we did feel it right to convey to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> the serious effect that failure
                            to “damp down” the dispute would have on American public support for
                            U.S. policy in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> referred back to reference he had already
                            inserted in discussions of Honolulu meeting to the fact that such public
                            support was currently threatened, as never before, and that there was
                            serious danger of its erosion. In this context,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted, serious dispute between two
                            friendly nations and key <pb n="818" xml:id="pg_818" facs="0856"/>members of <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> could have serious
                            negative consequences in terms of U.S. public and Congressional
                            opinion;</p>
                        <p>C) <persName>Bundy</persName> went on that any resort to military action
                            would be disastrous in the same context. We welcomed <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' clear statement on this aspect,
                            and <persName>Bundy</persName> said we would have had no doubt that this
                            was <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> position (sic), and that we were
                            equally confident that any measures <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            might take would be defensive in character (no reference was made to any
                            specific items of evidence, other than “inevitable rumors”, nor did
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> follow up or mention
                            any specific items.);</p>
                        <p>D) In line with <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' desire to
                            keep the matter under discussion, we continue to feel that any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> role would be most unwise, but equally
                            felt that Asian friends of both parties might play useful role
                            particularly in the corridors at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> meetings. <persName>Bundy</persName> particularly
                            noted that both Thai and Indonesia were interested and objective nations
                            and also referred to Korean concern expressed to
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> in Seoul—noting that
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> had suggested side discussions in
                            Canberra and also that we did not believe ROKG itself knew enough about
                            the matter to be really helpful.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> took all this in good
                            part. His manner throughout was sober, and gave impression not merely of
                            saying the right things but of meaning them. Discussion flowed easily
                            and with apparent clear understanding.</p>
                        <p>4. Other discussions during <persName>Bundy</persName> visit, with Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and with <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>, appear to make clear that: A)
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> does regard non-withdrawal of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> Ambassador in Manila as a
                            conciliatory gesture; B) <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>
                            definitely plans to attend Canberra and Djakarta meetings personally,
                            and specifically mentioned his hope for quiet discussions with <persName corresp="#p_RDA1">Razak</persName> on these occasions; C) Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' statement on local
                            political pressure from the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu and from student
                            elements seemed unconvincing. Likewise <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' reference to potential revolt in “southern
                            Mindanao”—which he did not amplify—struck a hollow note to us.
                            Nonetheless, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> made more
                            political sense in referring to attacks by newspapers and opportunist
                            opposition elements—and we surmise that this is the core of the matter
                            here.</p>
                        <p>5. In sum, we believe that private conversation can have left <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in no doubt (A) that we were not
                            going to become involved and that we are looking to Asian friends to
                            help; (B) that our objective judgment was that continued crises on this
                            issue would have serious negative effects on our ability to continue
                            policies of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>,
                            which we believe to be supported in essence by the most likely
                            successors.</p>
                        <p>6. Department will wish to instruct key posts on how to handle this
                            discussion in local capitals. <persName>Bundy</persName> instinct is
                            that Australians and perhaps British should be told full position for
                            their own knowledge <pb n="819" xml:id="pg_819" facs="0857"/>only, with

                            most effective here and at same time least susceptible to negative

                                its “best current estimate on the Phil attitude towards Sabah.” It
                                believed the issue was in danger of becoming a “national cause,”
                                exacerbated by the widespread public perception that the United
                                States favored Malaysia's claim. The Embassy suggested that Sabah
                                provided <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> with a
                                potential issue to distract attention from his domestic problems and
                                distance himself from the United States, but he was not considering

                        <p>1. It is a truism that U.S.-Philippine relations are in many ways unique.
                            With no other nation in Asia do we share the same closeness <pb n="820" xml:id="pg_820" facs="0858"/>of sentimental and emotional ties.
                            Nowhere else in Asia do we have such a visible and overwhelming
                            political, military and economic presence. Only Thailand rivals the
                            Philippines as a base of support for our military effort in Vietnam. All
                            these factors create a network of ties which makes it impossible to
                            divorce actions of the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> from its
                            relations with the U.S. The Philippine dispute with Malaysia over Sabah
                            has, therefore, an unavoidable effect on our bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>2. As reported reftel, there has been a strong emotional reaction to what
                            many Filipinos view as a rejection and repudiation by the U.S. The
                            reflex reaction was a desire to punish the U.S. expressed in demands for
                                <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> withdrawal, modification
                            or termination of the bases agreement and renegotiation of the defense
                            treaty. While the British and Malaysia got their lumps, the focus of
                            most of the demonstrations was against the U.S. The demonstration Sept
                            30 at Clark Air Base, the restriction of military overflights and
                            landing rights, customs harassment in the port of Manila are further
                            manifestations of GOP displeasure.</p>
                        <p>3. If President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> should
                            decide to follow a more active course in pressing the Philippine claim
                            to Sabah it is almost inevitable that the established American position
                            of impartiality will be interpreted as opposition to the Philippines (if
                            we are not with them we're against them).<note n="3" xml:id="d370fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Foreign Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> met at the United
                                Nations on October 8 and discussed the Sabah dispute. <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> reiterated more than once that
                                the Philippines had no intention of going to war over Sabah.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stressed that the
                                dispute should not be settled by force and observed that there is a
                                distinction between the United States acting on the basis of the
                                status quo and taking sides in a territorial dispute. <hi rend="italic">Rusk</hi> told <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName>: “Don't draw us into this; we have a basketful
                                already.” (Telegram 252294 to Manila, October 9; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 PHIL)</note> The negative aspects
                            of Philippine nationalism have traditionally focused on the U.S., and
                            the Philippine claim could easily become more anti-American than
                            anti-Anglo Malaysian. Philippine youth does not have the built-in
                            restraint of memories of wartime cooperation with the U.S. Once Congress
                            has reconvened we can expect its more vocal members to join the effort
                            to get political benefit from attacks on the U.S. If this should be the
                            course of events, we will be in for a dicey time. The extent of our
                            exposure in this country produces a multitude of targets, and life could
                            be made most unpleasant without outright violation of the letter of any
                            of the network of agreements linking our two countries.</p>
                        <p>4. Our military relations are particularly sensitive. We have outstanding
                            commitments to discuss a number of provisions of the bases agreement and
                            of course general commitments in <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName>-Serrano to discuss “any question of particular
                            interest” to either government. A formal demand by the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> for renegotiation, followed by a tough
                                <pb n="821" xml:id="pg_821" facs="0859"/>approach and protracted
                            talks, could have a serious adverse effect on military planning for the
                            whole of the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia. The pending Smith case
                            could be used as the basis for a request to renegotiate the bases
                            agreement or could be combined with other general harassment of U.S.
                            interests. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> may also seek formal
                            renegotiation of the defense treaty in an effort to extract a more
                            categorical commitment to immediate defense of the Philippines should it
                            come under attack. There is also a broad range of other harassments
                            which might include any combination of the following: </p>
                        <p>A. Stimulate labor troubles on the bases.</p>
                        <p>B. Over-bureaucratize customs procedures to point of stoppages—insist on
                            customs control at Subic and Clark.</p>
                        <p>C. Take away our military radio frequencies (or harassment short of
                            complete denial).</p>
                        <p>D. Institute clearance procedure of various degrees of cumbersomeness for
                            all, or various categories, of U.S. and military flights (in country-out
                            of country).</p>
                        <p>E. Deliberate slowness on visas for contractor employees and technical
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>F. Harass our military personnel with criminal actions.</p>
                        <p>G. Insist on taxation of MAC charter flights.</p>
                        <p>H. Insist on having Philippine customs, tax, immigration people on
                            base.</p>
                        <p>I. Tax sealand shipments-vehicle registration, income tax, etc.</p>
                        <p>J. Licensing of on base contractors.</p>
                        <p>5. Philippine economic nationalism and individual greed, already making
                            life difficult for American business, is certain to intensify as the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> uses this technique of getting
                            at the U.S. by vicarious punishment of American business. Following is a
                            recap of existing or possible additional moves in this field.</p>
                        <p>A. Delay action on applications of American businessmen for
                            treaty-trader-investor visas.</p>
                        <p>B. Postpone Senate consideration of ratification of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> double taxation agreement (already
                            ratified by U.S. Senate).</p>
                        <p>C. Institute further court actions against U.S. business under Retail
                            Trade Act.</p>
                        <p>D. Push through Oil Commission bill in next special session of Congress
                            to detriment of U.S. oil companies.</p>
                        <p>E. Approval by President of anti-discrimination bill (equal pay for equal
                            work).</p>
                        <p>F. Customs harassment on clearance of goods (including remnants) from
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. In the political field, the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            apparently still feels that it can hurt us by opening diplomatic and
                            trade ties with the Communist world. Plans are going ahead for a
                            govt-sponsored company for trading with Communist bloc. The presence of
                            a Soviet ambassador in Kuala Lumpur could now take on heightened
                            significance, and as some Congressmen <pb n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0860"/>have suggested, there have been feints at seeking to
                            obtain military equipment from the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> is an obvious target, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has the relatively
                            graceful out of pleading insufficient funds to maintain it in Viet-Nam.
                            He may, however, decide to go slow in a Philippine withdrawal since it
                            would cancel his claim to a place at the peace table and, perhaps even
                            more important, a chance to share in the post-war division of American
                            military equipment. Rotation of <gloss target="#t_PHILCAG1">PHILCAG</gloss> to maintain the existing 1,500 strength level is
                            now in progress and if the lift remains on schedule rotation will be
                            completed on Oct 15. Several options short of complete withdrawal are
                            open to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> including further
                            across the board scaling down or selected withdrawal of engineer
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>8. U.S. interests in the broader context of regional cooperation are also
                            bound to suffer. The <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> Commerce
                            and Industry Council met on schedule in Manila with a brave show of
                            regional harmony, but the relentless logic of a consistent stand for and
                            against the claim will tend to force the Filipinos and Malaysians into
                            head-on collision in every common regional body, with a consequent
                            disruptive effect on the whole framework of regional cooperation.</p>
                        <p>9. The foregoing bleak picture of a possible course of Philippine-U.S.
                            relations is based on a pessimistic projection of events. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> in the coming days will be
                            weighing carefully the advantages and disadvantages of the options open
                            to him. In the third message in this series we will discuss courses of
                            action which might help to shape his decisions.<note n="4" xml:id="d370fn4">In telegram 15956 from Manila, October 4, the

                        <p>16312. Subject: <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> talk with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Today I had the most basic and best talk yet with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. He had asked me to come over
                            Monday when I telephoned him Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2">October 12.</note> with Department's answer to his inquiry on
                            Admiral Bringle's visit to Malaysia. The meeting was preceded by a
                            preliminary meeting with Undersecretary of Defense Melchor and Chief of
                            JUSMAG Gomes present. This was a discussion on <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> purchase of ammunition from Taipei. It will be reported
                                separately.<note n="3" xml:id="d371fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> As that part of the meeting drew to a close, I
                            told the President I would like to bring something else up and he
                            immediately suggested a private conference. The way he did it suggested
                            to me that he had had this private conference in mind from the
                            beginning. Melchor and Gomes withdrew and the President and I retired to
                            the sitting space through the pillars behind his desk. There is a sofa
                            between two rattling air-conditioners and two large easy chairs.
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> will
                            remember this as the place where we met with the President. The
                            conversation was isolated and secure.</p>
                        <p>2. Anti-American demonstrations. The President began the conversation by
                            saying he understood that we were concerned with the official support of
                            the recent demonstrations. He said that it was true that he had close
                            touch with elements in these demonstrations, particularly students and
                            labor. He said and later repeated that while the situation now was under
                            control, at one point it was in danger of playing into and falling into
                            the hands of the Communists. As a consequence, he had maintained touch
                            with radical leaders and had infiltrated his people so as to maintain
                            control. He said, “You can tell your government that it can rely on the
                            fact that I am in charge and that there will be no anti-American
                            demonstrations that will get out of control.” He said that there were
                            some student organizations that were not strong enough and independent
                            enough to prevent the Communists and other radicals from leading them.
                            He then said that there were a number of radical leaders that he had
                            enveloped in order to prevent their working against him. He said that
                            Secretary of Labor Ople was one of these. He said he was a brilliant man
                            and if he were left loose <pb n="824" xml:id="pg_824" facs="0862"/>by
                            himself, he could organize against the government. He mentioned two or
                            three other names that I couldn't hear clearly. One of these was Adrian
                            Christobel, a young speech writer and associate of Ople.</p>
                        <p>3. At approximately this moment I moved in with the point which I had
                            originally intended to make with the President, namely that we felt that
                            the United States was being harassed in the Department of Finance in
                            matters such as Manila port customs. Specifically, after 18 years we
                            were being required to fill out long form declarations of tax exemption
                            which unduly tied up operations, required storage and opened
                            possibilities of pilferage, etc. As my purpose was to raise U.S. concern
                            about harassment of various kinds rather than seeking to work out any
                            particular point, I did not further develop the matter.</p>
                        <p>4. Sabah. The talk in connection with the demonstrations turned naturally
                            toward Sabah. The President said, “You know the Philippine people are
                            really concerned about Sabah. I didn't realize myself how concerned they
                            were. This is an important, serious issue with them.” The President said
                            again, as he had on previous occasions, that the Moslems were causing
                            him a great deal of trouble on this issue. He said that Mindanao Moslems
                            could be a problem because they could go to Sabah at any time and could
                            cause trouble there. He said again as he said when Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> spoke with him,<note n="4" xml:id="d371fn4">See <ref target="#d369">Document
                                369</ref>.</note> that he would do everything to try to stop them
                            from doing this, including his using force. He brought this latter
                            matter up in connection with his last point, namely that the United
                            States could help settle the Sabah issue.</p>
                        <p>5. Clark guns to Huks. The President next came up with three specific
                            subjects. The first was his observation that guns and ammunition were
                            getting out of Clark Field to the Huks. He admitted perhaps some had
                            been stolen. He incidentally remarked that he had figures to indicate
                            that there was enough alcohol coming into Clark to provide two gallons
                            per day to each man. He said they were worried that there were a lot of
                            luxury cars at Clark and that these and other luxury items could turn up
                            in the black market. I told the President I would get in touch with
                            Clark Field and have a specific survey made immediately of the
                            possibilities of guns and ammunition getting to the Huks and that as
                            soon as I had a complete answer I would ask the President for a meeting
                            and would bring the 13th Air Force Commander to sit in with him to go
                            over the whole thing. He indicated that he would be pleased to do so. On
                            the matter of alcohol and luxury items, I said that the use of long
                            forms or short forms in clearing shipping through Manila would do
                            nothing to help solve that problem. I said, however, <pb n="825" xml:id="pg_825" facs="0863"/>that we would be pleased to sit down
                            with anyone to examine the problem and then to determine what
                            specifically could be done to control it. In speaking about the
                            possibility of arms getting to the Huks. He said, “Can't you do
                            something about security at Clark.” I said that starting with Smith
                            incident, we had begun a complete review of all base security and would
                            at the proper time welcome the opportunity to sit down with the
                            Philippine authorities to see whether there were additional ways and
                            means either unilaterally or bilaterally, to control this problem which
                            concerned us very much.</p>
                        <p>6. Lansdale working politically against President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. He opened this point with a
                            question, “Where is Lansdale anyway? Is he working for the U.S.
                            Government?” Of course I told the President that Lansdale was not
                            working for the government but was in Honolulu at the East-West Center.
                            I speculated that he was in a position where both Filipinos and
                            Americans travelling from Manila to U.S. could be in contact with him
                            and come back with stories, true or fabricated about their meetings with
                            him. The President then said that he understood that Lansdale and 20 or
                            30 people were disappointed in him as President because he hadn't
                            adequately repaid them for the help they had given him in his
                            Presidential election. He then said, “I understand that Lansdale is
                            trying to develop a candidate to beat me in the coming election.” I told
                            him that the U.S. Government had nothing whatsoever to do with Lansdale
                            nor with anything he might be doing in developing a political opponent
                            for <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>. I told him that the
                            U.S. is staying strictly out of any internal political matters. At the
                            same time if we, as observers only had to lay odds on the outcome “in
                            the language of the Philippine press you would be our bet. First of all
                            you are the most likely winner and secondly you are by and large trying
                            to do the things we would like to see done. Of course we are not backing
                            anyone and we are not going to.” The President terminated this part of
                            our conversation by saying that he would very much appreciate it if we
                            could get to Lansdale and tell him in some way to lay off. I said that
                            we hadn't any way to do that inasmuch as he was not employed by us in
                            any way but I would pass the message on to see whether Washington had
                            any ideas on the subject.</p>
                        <p>7. Washington dislike of Philippines. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> opened new subject by saying, “I
                            don't think the State Department really likes the Philippines.” He said
                            his Ambassador in Washington had sent a report that in some recent
                            public statements about foreign aid the Philippines wasn't mentioned
                            once. I told him that I was frankly worried about the same thing. I
                            said, “A moment ago, Mr. President, you said that you could ultimately
                            control Ople because you fought together in Bataan. In this country and
                            in mine there is a new generation who doesn't remember Bataan and they
                            look at these things in a different <pb n="826" xml:id="pg_826" facs="0864"/>light.” I said that introspection in our country was
                            prevalent. Our aid bill is the smallest in history. People in the U.S.
                            are fed up with other countries and are looking inward. I said that this
                            meant that people like the President and myself who wanted to see good
                            relations between countries must be particularly careful to keep our
                            lines straight. I said that any of the little irritants that come up are
                            viewed in a different light from the earlier days of our close
                            relationship. I said that some of the things that had happened recently
                            in the Philippines were not making a good impression at home and that he
                            knew what the McCloskey statement had blown up into in the
                                Philippines.<note n="5" xml:id="d371fn5">See <ref target="#d371fn3">footnote 3</ref>, Document <ref target="#d373">373</ref>.</note> I said that I thought my government would feel
                            good about our conversation because I could tell them what he was really
                            thinking about and that I hoped we could periodically have discussions
                            to review the problems between us. He agreed that this was a good
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>8. Philippines/Malaysia summit. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> then went on to say, “I want to ask your
                            government's help in getting a successful meeting between Malaysia and
                            myself. I would like to see a picture taken of the Tunku and me sitting
                            down at such a meeting.” I said first of all I would like to understand
                            whether President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> would be
                            satisfied with a conference only involving a picture of himself taken
                            with the Tunku or whether he was going to open a discussion in search of
                            a Sabah solution. “I would like to get together and talk about lessening
                            the tension between our countries,” he said. I said, “We have taken the
                            position constantly that we would like to see your two countries get
                            together. We would certainly favor such a meeting. We have always wanted
                            to see your neighbors help you get together, since we want to keep our
                            profile very low. I don't know what we ourselves can do to bring about a
                            meeting between you two.” He then said, “If I may make a suggestion, I
                            would like to suggest that your country could get together with the
                            British to move Malaysia in the direction of such a conference.” He said
                            that he had talked with the British Ambassador recently about this
                            matter. I said that I would convey the President's feelings to my
                            government and I added that I felt sure my government would be very
                            happy to know of the President's interest in trying to get the Sabah
                            matter calmed down.</p>
                        <p>9. Conclusions. While I want to think over the implications of this
                            conference before making a final report, after a preliminary discussion
                            with top staff members, I think I can safely conclude that this was an
                            important and useful conversation. Among the implications would be
                            these: (A) our ties to the President through him, Rafferty to Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and directly to the
                            President are working well and providing a method <pb n="827" xml:id="pg_827" facs="0865"/>of communication which, among other
                            things, permits testing of the waters before Ambassadorial
                            conversations; (B) it seems clear that the objective of having the
                            President come to us, as raised in our previous summary telegrams, was
                            partly achieved, although we left our door open through the Rafferty
                            route. President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> is
                            evidently concerned about what the U.S. thinks about his involvement in
                            the recent anti-U.S. demonstrations and was concerned about the
                            indications of Washington coolness towards the Philippines as conveyed
                            to them through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LSP1">Lopez</persName>.
                            We continue to believe, however, that further signals to <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> of the indirect sort suggested in
                            our trilogy of cables would be helpful and would appreciate Department's
                            views; (C) he definitely showed a raw nerve in his concern that the U.S.
                            Government might be supporting Lansdale in developing his alleged
                            campaign against <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>'
                            re-election. We have had previous indications from weeks back that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> was concerned that the
                            U.S. Government was conspiring against him; (D) the Malaysia ploy either
                            indicates that he is trying to please us by doing something which will
                            show an attitude which we would approve, or he is genuinely interested
                            in our assistance with the British, as he had been before his Sabah
                            statement, or both; (E) we have not yet satisfied ourselves as to just
                            what the Clark Field guns to the Huks point really means. It may be only
                            that he is opening a possible bridge to further discussions. This matter
                            is an old chestnut that the President has been fully informed about and
                            we will of course bring him up to date; (F) all in all, the President's
                            demeanor, the tone of the conversation and the several openings for
                            further intimate discussions, inclines me to the view that this
                            conversation has the potential for closer and hopefully better relations
                            with the President.</p>

                        <p>1. The Philippine Government recently amended its legislation concerning
                            territorial seas and internal waters, thereby reasserting its claim to
                            an area of the high seas which at one point extends over 300 miles from
                            the nearest Philippine land area of any consequence. This is a
                            repetition of a previous claim made by the Philippine Government which
                            we and other nations have never recognized. In 1961 we officially
                            notified the Philippine Government of our non-recognition of this claim,
                            and we consider it advisable to repeat our position at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. If this had been the only issue raised by the Philippine Government,
                            it could have been handled in a low key and with little or no
                            controversy with the Philippine Government. However, the Philippine
                            Government has also for the first time attempted to deny the right of
                            innocent passage to warships by requiring prior permission for passage
                            of warships through Philippine claimed waters. This Philippine position
                            was expressed in an Aide-Mémoire delivered to the British Government
                            (Tab A),<note n="2" xml:id="d372fn2">As contained in telegram 13143 from

                            terms of these documents, the Philippine position would apply to all
                            armed foreign public vessels. We do not feel we can leave this position
                            unchallenged. It is contrary to the United States Government's view that
                            a requirement of previous authorization for passage of warships is
                            inconsistent with the right of innocent passage for warships guaranteed
                            by the Convention on the Territorial Sea and customary international
                            law. Philippine enforcement of their announced policy would create a
                            precedent that invites application of this principle to other areas such
                            as the Straits of Gibraltar, thereby <pb n="829" xml:id="pg_829" facs="0867"/>endangering passage that is crucial to the strategic
                            interests of the United States, its allies, and the free world. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> (particularly the Navy), and the Office
                            of the Legal Adviser in the Department feel very strongly, and we in
                                <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss> concur, that we must not allow
                            this precedent to take hold.</p>
                        <p>3. Both the British and the Australians are faced with the necessity of
                            replying to notes and Aides-Mémoire but their Embassies here expressed a
                            desire to consult with us in advance. The British have prepared draft
                            replies, a note protesting the legislation (Tab D) and an Aide-Mémoire
                            in response to the Philippine Aide-Mémoire on innocent passage (Tab
                                E).<note n="5" xml:id="d372fn5">Neither attached.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Given the current anger of the Filipinos against the British growing
                            out of the Sabah dispute and British actions in support of Malaysia, it
                            is our conviction that a delivery of the British note and Aide-Mémoire
                            without adequate advance preparation would cause further controversy and
                            lead the Filipinos to digging in even stronger in their untenable
                            position. Given our overall strategic interest, we would not be able to
                            avoid involvement. For this reason, we believe the best procedure for
                            all concerned and the one offering the best chance of avoidance of an
                            unpleasant clash between the Filipinos and their best friends is for our
                            Embassy in Manila (preferably Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> with President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>) to have a frank talk with Filipino officials.

                        <p>1. In analyzing the Philippine situation, complete objectivity is
                            difficult at this moment because US-Philippine relations have once again
                            gone sour. Our major objectives are substantially unimpaired and our
                            relations on the surface remain cordial, but consistent with the
                            four-year cycle that makes the third year in office of each Philippine
                            President one of reciprocal disappointments, there is now annoyance and
                            frustration on both sides.</p>
                        <p>2. The Philippines has its traditional ambivalent complaints of too much
                            American economic presence but too little American investment; too much
                            American military presence but too few unqualified, automatic defense
                            guarantees; too much American paternalism but not enough tangible
                            demonstrations of paternal affection. The McCloskey statement on
                                Sabah<note n="3" xml:id="d373fn3">On September 19 Department of
                                State Spokesman McCloskey stated that the United States recognized
                                Malaysia in 1963, and the press concluded that he had stated that
                                the United States recognized Malaysia's claim to Sabah. On the next
                                day, September 20, McCloskey stated that recognition of Malaysia in
                                1963 was in no way a departure from U.S. neutrality toward the
                                competing Philippines and Malaysian claims to Sabah. The United
                                States recognized countries with territorial disputes without taking
                                sides, as was the case when the United States recognized India and
                                Pakistan without reference to Kashmir. (Telegram 15394 from Manila,

                            Filipinos, reportedly even the President, felt the US had deliberately
                            stabbed the Philippines in the back. Others more sympathetic felt the
                            McCloskey statement was unfortunate and ill-advised. Sabah aside,
                            however, most of the Philippine gripes are chronic, not acute.<note n="4" xml:id="d373fn4">In telegram 17833 from Manila, November 22,

                                relations. She specifically mentioned rumors that Edward Lansdale

                            vested rights and land ownership issues promise to injure both the
                            Philippines itself and US investors. Crime, graft, and corruption are on
                            the rise. For the first time there was palace complicity in anti-US
                            demonstrations. Guerrero's tactics in Bangkok and the way <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> has pursued the Philippine claim
                            to Sabah have cast a pall over the bright new day of regionalism we were
                            [garble—planning?] for Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>4. We also have a rash of other nagging irritations and complaints,
                            related principally to the movement of military cargo to our bases in
                            the Philippines. In the words of a prominent US official, we are fed to
                            the teeth with the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>5. The Filipinos, on their side, have been conducting business with the
                            US in a normal manner following the traditional pattern of manipulation
                            of an indulgent, generous, permissive foster parent. To use a favorite
                            Philippine cliche, they have taken us for granted. They have utilized,
                            but far from the fullest, the two major levers which we placed in their
                            hands; our need for the military bases and our desire to have Philippine
                            troops represented in Viet-Nam. Until very recently they were apparently
                            completely unaware of the resentment building up in the US. Showing an
                            uncharacteristic lack of sensitivity, they failed to recognize that
                            historical protectors and patrons of the Philippines had all but
                            vanished from the American scene. The Philippines is now being judged on
                            an objective standard—perhaps even somewhat more strictly since as a
                            former US charge we expected them to be leading, not falling behind,
                            their Asian neighbors.</p>
                        <p>6. Following <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' triumphal US
                            tour and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s many
                            favorable comments on the <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>
                            administration, the Philippine Government was so sure of itself and the
                            effectiveness of backdoor diplomacy that saw no need for first-rate
                            diplomatic representation in Washington. There has been no full time
                            Ambassador since Ledesma departed in 1965. A diplomatic mission of
                            monumental mediocrity provided no really effective eyes and ears for the
                            Philippine Govt in Washington. The American Ambassador to the
                            Philippines, in <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>' own words,
                            was also the Philippine Ambassador to the US. Only within the past few
                            weeks has the situation gradually come home to the Philippines as
                            junketeering Philippine Congressmen, govt officials and businessmen
                            returned from the US in a state of surprise and alarm over the frosty
                            displeasure they found.</p>
                        <p>7. These reports served to accentuate a growing mood of doubt and
                            uncertainty in the Philippine mind about the future of their relations
                                <pb n="832" xml:id="pg_832" facs="0870"/>with the US brought on by
                            other events. The bombing halt and the possibility that 1969 might bring
                            an end to the war in Viet-Nam started the Filipinos thinking that there
                            might be a change in US attitude toward its military presence in Asia
                            following such a settlement. The election of Richard Nixon created a
                            whole new range of uncertainties about the policies of the new
                            administration, and the Filipinos began to circle warily around a number
                            of indications that Southeast Asia might decline in order of priority
                            and the Philippines might lose the leverage which they have come to
                            believe was a permanent aspect of their relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>8. Within the Philippines itself, the country is entering a period of
                            transition which will in any event have an effect on Philippine-US
                            relations. The President elected in 1969 will probably be the last
                            Filipino chief executive who remembers the Commonwealth. In 1973 the
                            post-war generation will be a major element of the electorate. The US
                            will have lost most of its automatic “constituency,” except perhaps in
                            the provinces, and the President elected in that year, and all those
                            aspiring to the Presidency will have to accommodate to the more
                            independent, internally oriented new Filipino. <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName>, as a transition President, is
                            already feeling the conflicting pulls of the familiar security and
                            dependence of the old US-Philippine ties and the exciting perils and
                            promise of full independence.</p>
                        <p>9. The road ahead in our relations with the Philippines is in fact
                            obscured by at least three major uncertainties. We do not yet know the
                            full programs and policies of the new administration that will take
                            effect next January. We cannot forsee in any detail the circumstances
                            which will surround the settlement of the conflict in Viet-Nam, nor the
                            results of the reassessment of our entire forward base structure which
                            seems almost certain to follow such a settlement. Finally, we cannot
                            forsee the nature of the extent of the post-1974 relations between the
                            two countries on trade and investment matters.</p>
                        <p>10. Our relations with the Philippines in the economic field are
                            inevitably moving toward a diminution of the intimacy that has existed
                            heretofore. This is in part due to the operation of secular historical
                            forces as time passes since the Philippines was a member of the American
                            body politic. However, the pace is forced by the pressure of Philippine
                            nationalism. In investment matters nationalism is leading them to define
                            in narrower terms the role that foreign investment, including US
                            investment, is to play in Philippine development. In trade matters, it
                            is moving them toward stronger protectionism through both tariff and
                            nontariff devices. Like all developing countries, the Philippines will
                            continue to require substantial help from the US and the rest of the
                            developed world, but it will increasingly attempt to obtain this help in
                            forms compatible with its nationalism.</p>
                        <pb n="833" xml:id="pg_833" facs="0871"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Analysis</p>
                        <p>11. What can we see as a likely future course of US-Philippine relations
                            beyond the current period of transition and uncertainty? Attempting to
                            filter out the highly subjective and emotionally charged range of
                            irritants stemming from a relationship which is perhaps too close,
                            certain basic and important US interests in the Philippines can be
                            identified.</p>
                        <p>12. Our first interest is that we have, in the broadest sense, a base of
                            power in the Philippines. We speak to Asia and even to Eastern Europe
                            through <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> transmitters in this
                            country, and communicate by the written word through publications
                            printed in the Regional Service Center. US military bases in the
                            Philippines include perhaps our single most important base in the Far
                            East and provide the fulcrum through which our military power is applied
                            in Asia. Twenty-four govt agencies maintain regional offices here. The
                            US Govt and American private business recruit labor here for work all
                            over Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. This broad range of
                            operational cooperation, functioning now for 22 years, we have come to
                            accept as the natural course of things because it has worked so well.
                            Nowhere else in Asia is US power—again using this word in its broadest
                            sense—exercised with such freedom and with such a degree of host country
                            indulgence.</p>
                        <p>13. Although our military bases in the Philippines are indeed the cause
                            of frequent misunderstandings and friction, we must not allow that to
                            becloud the fact that we are more than fortunate to have large-scale,
                            effective and efficient bases for US naval and air power in a
                            strategically vital position in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, there is
                            reason for optimism concerning our ability to retain this situation for
                            a good many years to come, probably considerably longer than will be
                            possible elsewhere in the Far East. As long as US policy dictates a
                            requirement to maintain a significant political and military influence
                            in the Far East, or at least in Southeast Asia, the retention of these
                            bases must be a primary, if not overriding, objective of our
                            US-Philippine relations.</p>
                        <p>14. Secondly, we have a selfish economic interest in Philippine
                            development. The Philippines could provide an excellent field for
                            increased US investment, if its shortsighted policies were to change. US
                            exports to the Philippines (some $300 million) also continue to grow,
                            even though our percentage of the market has markedly declined. A
                            prosperous expanding Philippine economy could stimulate economic
                            development elsewhere in Southeast Asia and stimulate further
                            opportunities for US investment and trade.</p>
                        <p>15. Thirdly, we have a special interest in the almost 35 million people
                            of the Philippines. They may no longer be our “little brown brothers”
                            but in the eyes of Asia, and much of the rest of the world, <pb n="834" xml:id="pg_834" facs="0872"/>they are marked to a greater or lesser
                            extent “made in America.” Their success or failure will be to some
                            degree a measure of the kind of people we are, how we respect our
                            responsibilities, and how valid are our political, economic, and
                            cultural beliefs.</p>
                        <p>16. This arises not only from over 50 years of domination of the
                            Philippines, but from the fact that the Philippines have professed the
                            same beliefs that we do and have in fact or appearance adopted us and
                            our ways.</p>
                        <p>17. With no other Asian nation do we share to the same degree political,
                            social, religious, and cultural values. It is not only that they have
                            taken over and adapted for their own use our Constitution and political
                            system as well as our private enterprise economy, but they have
                            assimilated many but obviously not all of our characteristics. What
                            other Asian society could produce a Corky Trinidad, whose excellent
                            political cartoons run simultaneously in Philippine and US papers? In
                            what other Asian society is there such freedom, if not license, in the
                            press? Where anywhere in the world could you find so much American
                            sports news in the press?</p>
                        <p>18. While there are differences of significance, of course, there are two
                            essential facts of importance. Filipinos have become in a marked degree
                            what they are because of us. On the one hand, this is a responsibility
                            and an opportunity for us, if we believe, as we do, that the spread of
                            independence and democracy promotes our own security and world peace. On
                            the other hand, our credibility, our prestige, and our influence are
                            tied with Philippine success or failure.</p>
                        <p>19. Fourthly, the US has been interested in the Philippines assuming a
                            role of leadership in the development of regionalism in Southeast Asia.
                            We were delighted when President <persName corresp="#p_MFE2">Marcos</persName> and FonSec <persName corresp="#p_RN1">Ramos</persName> assumed such a posture, and were disturbed and
                            dismayed when the Sabah affair disrupted these good beginnings.</p>
                        <p>20. Fifthly, we have the same normal interests in good relations with the
                            Philippines that we have with the other nations of the world. We
                            appreciate an opportunity to influence them in bilateral and world
                            affairs in a direction that we deem helpful overall.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems inherent in US interests</p>
                        <p>21. Continuing use of military bases and the protection of private
                            national investments carry with them strong colonial overtones. These
                            continuing manifestations of American military and economic power tend
                            to produce strong nationalist emotions even among those intellectually
                            aware of the substantial contribution bases and American business make
                            to Philippine well-being.</p>
                        <p>22. There is also a growing tendency to see the bases as serving US
                            national interests more than Philippine national interests. A
                            conventional <pb n="835" xml:id="pg_835" facs="0873"/>military threat
                            from Communist China now seems less imminent and there are those that
                            argue that the bases constitute a target for the growing Chinese nuclear
                            capability. However, even of those who resent the bases, most recognize
                            their necessity for the immediate future for Philippine security.</p>
                        <p>23. Our efforts to protect American business interests are challenged by
                            elements of the elite and doctrinaire govt officials motivated by
                            economic nationalism and/or cupidity. At a time when the developing
                            world is competing vigorously for capital assistance from a developed
                            world, we find ourselves in the paradoxical position of using US
                            bargaining assets to persuade the Filipinos to preserve what in their
                            own interest they should be seeking.</p>
                        <p>24. Objectives in the field of nation building have the inherent
                            limitation that this building process in the final analysis must be
                            accomplished by the Filipinos themselves. We can stimulate, urge and
                            cajole, but we cannot force on them economic and political salvation.
                            Our exhortations to get on with the job of nation building also create a
                            pitfall. If the Filipinos come to believe that we are more anxious to
                            see them achieve these goals than they are themselves, “nation building”
                            becomes merely a slogan by which they extract assets from us. We also
                            can find ourselves in the position of paying the Filipinos for the
                            privilege of helping them, and our inputs tend to become not supplements
                            but substitutes for the allocation of Philippine resources.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future policy</p>
                        <p>1. In our projections of US policy we are making several basic
                            assumptions:</p>
                        <p>A. The US will require some or all its military bases for a ten to twenty
                            year period.</p>
                        <p>B. The Philippines will continue to be an important place for US
                            investment and trade.</p>
                        <p>C. US will recognize that Philippine progress is an important element in
                            its prestige and operations in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>D. US will be interested in Philippine cooperation in Southeast Asian
                            regionalism.</p>
                        <p>E. US will be interested in continued good relations with the Republic of
                            the Philippines.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military</p>
                        <p>25. To maintain our military base structure for ten to twenty years we
                            should do the following:</p>
                        <p>A. We must impress the Filipinos that US use of bases in the Philippines
                            are in the interests of both the Philippines and the US. In addition to
                            the normal public relations programs, in-depth programs should be
                            developed such as perhaps joint war games that will bring home to the
                            Philippine military the importance of US bases and forces to their
                            security.</p>
                        <pb n="836" xml:id="pg_836" facs="0874"/>
                        <p>B. We should continue military aid, particularly technical assistance,
                            training in the US, etc., so as to preserve vital person-to-person
                            relationships and common traditions and common equipment.</p>
                        <p>C. Special attention should be given to continued progressive base labor
                            relations: strikes or slowdowns of local base workers could cripple the
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>D. We should interpret criminal jurisdiction provisions of our base
                            agreements sympathetically with every effort made to avoid incidents,
                            including greatest possible use of Philippine buffers.</p>
                        <p>E. We should give sympathetic consideration to increased joint
                            responsibility and/or visible appearance thereof, consonant with
                            effective operational control.</p>
                        <p>F. In the field of mutual defense, the clearest possible definition, as
                            authoritative as possible, of our immediate reaction response compatible
                            with overall US policy.</p>
                        <p>G. We should negotiate all moves. Let Filipinos win where we should yield
                            rather than US gratuitously give. We should yield progressively not
                            precipitously or too late.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic</p>
                        <p>26. In working out with the Philippines a new basis for the economic
                            arrangements to succeed Laurel-Langley, our policy should be one of
                            gradual rather than sudden and wrenching change. We should recognize the
                            painfulness for the Filipino, both in psychological and economic terms
                            of the phasing out of the “special relationship,” even though this
                            change is what they want. In the negotiations we should maintain a
                            flexible position and open mind on possible measures required to ease
                            the pain of transition in such fields as tariffs (even the continuation
                            of preferences), commodities, investment, and perhaps even credit. This
                            posture would be founded on a recognition that, within broad limits, a
                            satisfactory military-political relationship will be impossible to
                            maintain in the absence of an economic one which the Philippines regard
                            as reasonably satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>27. Our economic policy should contain the following major elements:</p>
                        <p>A. We should make a special report to bring home to the Filipinos the
                            advantages of good business climate and the manifold contributions of
                            foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>B. As a complementary effort we should resist the anti-foreign thrust of
                            Philippine policy on investment matters. We should do so in part because
                            we have a legitimate duty to ensure that American interests receive
                            equitable treatment, and in part because foreign investment is keenly
                            needed for Philippine development.</p>
                        <pb n="837" xml:id="pg_837" facs="0875"/>
                        <p>C. We should recognize that despite its well-known weaknesses and
                            inequities, the free enterprise economy of the Philippines is a vital
                            dynamic force. It is a good calculated risk.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Philippine nation building</p>
                        <p>28. Our assistance to the Philippines in the process of nation building
                            should include the following elements:</p>
                        <p>A. We should continue to provide feasible economic assistance
                            particularly in the technical area for nation building and as a means of
                            maintaining close man-to-man relationships and common interests between
                            the President and the Ambassador and between other US and Philippine
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>B. We should encourage miracle rice expansion through proper storage,
                            milling, marketing, and export programs. This should be followed by
                            diversification to field and feed crops, and pork, poultry, and beef
                            programs to maintain labor intensive, profit making agri-industry.</p>
                        <p>C. We should encourage road and infrastructure development programs.</p>
                        <p>D. We should provide assistance to law and order programs consistent with
                            Philippine inputs.</p>
                        <p>E. We should continue to encourage the growth of legitimate labor
                            unionism and the economic advancement of the working people.</p>
                        <p>F. We should give selective encouragement to manpower training to meet
                            the needs of existing and new industries. At the same time we should
                            recognize that with the end of the Viet-Nam conflict there may be a
                            sudden return of many skilled or semi-skilled workers who could disrupt
                            labor market and cause unrest.</p>
                        <p>G. We should continue to provide support to Philippine programs of
                            population control and family planning.</p>
                        <p>H. Peace Corps and other agency programs to improve the ability of
                            Filipino teachers to teach their students to think, rather than
                            memorize, as well as Peace Corps programs in the field of agriculture,
                            economic planning, public health, and community development, should
                            continue.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Regionalism</p>
                        <p>29. Regionalism, if it is to grow beyond acronyms, must meet what the
                            nations of Southeast Asia see themselves as a pressing need. Our
                            capacity to persuade the Filipinos to recognize this need is limited,
                            but we can by current programs of quiet backing of Asian initiatives, as
                            well as tactful indirect support of regional cooperation, speed up this
                            process.</p>
                        <p>30. The Sabah dispute is currently a significant obstacle to regionalism.
                            Here again, our capacity for successful direct intervention is <pb n="838" xml:id="pg_838" facs="0876"/>limited, but we can continue to
                            give behind-the-scenes support to Asian efforts to find a solution.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Good relations</p>
                        <p>31. We should continue our efforts to put our relations with the
                            Philippines on a basis which recognizes sovereign equality and mutual
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>32. We should broaden our contacts with the non-establishment side of
                            Philippine society—the youth, labor leaders, intellectuals, younger
                            military leaders, that are working for change and will play an
                            increasingly important role in shaping the destiny of this country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>33. The Philippines and the United States have a broad community of
                            interests. As a new US administration takes over we must recognize that
                            on the Philippine side this parallelism is imperfectly perceived. As the
                            Philippines develops, however, there will be a growing recognition that
                            our relations are not based merely on sentimental friendship and a
                            patron-client dependency, but rather on a broader and more secure base
                            of compatible, complementary, national interests and objectives. The
                            strength of these ties make us optimistic for the future.</p>

                                (Ibid.)</note> Subject: Territorial seas and innocent passage.</p>
                        <p>1. Pursuant to references A and B, I took the above subject matter up
                            with the President at a meeting arranged to brief him on the findings of
                            a joint committee on weather reporting.</p>
                        <p>2. As luck would have it, after we had all shaken hands in front of his
                            desk, he asked me to retire with him to the couch and chair arrangement
                            in the back of the room behind the pillars where Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> and he had their last
                            conference. When he did not raise any matter of substance right away, I
                            took the opportunity to raise the territorial seas and people appeared
                            to withdraw and permit us the opportunity of relatively secure
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>3. I began by saying that there appeared to be a matter on which our two
                            governments seemed to have a serious difference of principle in which
                            our views were shared by a number of the Philippines' best friends.
                            Under these circumstances, I said, I thought it best to have a frank and
                            friendly discussion to see whether some means could be found to avoid
                            public confrontation.</p>
                        <p>4. I then said that the problem had two related aspects: (A) the
                            Philippines archipelago claim on territorial seas which we have never
                            recognized and have so advised the Philippine Government officially, the
                            last time in 1961; (B) the “right of innocent passage.”</p>
                        <pb n="840" xml:id="pg_840" facs="0878"/>
                        <p>5. I then made reference to the Malacanang press release dated December
                            23 which quoted the aide-mémoire to the British to the effect that
                            “armed foreign public vessels — cannot assert or exercise the so-called
                            right of innocent passage through the Philippine territorial sea without
                            the permission of the Philippine Government.” I said, “As you know, it
                            is the position of the United States Government that the right of
                            innocent passage is firmly established under international law and that
                            my government believes it is of the greatest importance that this right
                            be maintained. We recognize that the Philippine Government is not a
                            party to the convention on territorial seas but that it is our view that
                            this convention still sets forth established principles of customary
                            international law in this area.”</p>
                        <p>6. Then I stated that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has always
                            supported the right of innocent passage and that it is even more
                            important today. I said that to accept the denial of the right of
                            innocent passage could in our view create a precedent for similar action
                            in other parts of the world, such as the Straits of Gibraltar.
                            Furthermore, I said, “Were we to acquiesce in such claims, denying naval
                            access to large sea areas of the world, it would seriously affect the
                            strategic interest of the United States, its allies, and the free world,
                            and we believe would be inconsistent with the overall strategic
                            interests of the Philippines itself. It is for this reason that we feel
                            we must in all friendship raise these issues with you at this time.”</p>
                        <p>7. Next I recognized that because of our agreements there was no question
                            of right of innocent passage between us but that the public statement
                            made by the Philippine Government places us in a difficult position.
                            Further, I said, “Both of us are aware that a number of our mutual
                            friends—Britain, Australia, New Zealand—share our views on the
                            importance of maintaining the right of innocent passage.” Then I said
                            “Is there any way to resolve the issue quietly—would the President
                            consider retracting the press statement? Would he consider holding back
                            on enforcement?”</p>
                        <p>8. The President followed my presentation closely and responded
                            agreeably. He recognized that a serious problem was posed and intimated
                            that it was not of his making. He said that this of course was something
                            that the legislature had done.</p>
                        <p>9. He said he would like time to think it over but that probably two
                            panels could be set up to review the matter quietly.</p>
                        <p>10. We ultimately broke off with the idea that he would consider the
                            matter further.</p>
                        <p>11. From what he said, and his demeanor, I got the impression that he had
                            no intention of pushing this matter to a confrontation but that as of
                            the moment he had no particular solution in mind that would avoid the
                            confrontation, although I think he would be agreeable to finding or
                            accepting one.</p>
                        <pb n="841" xml:id="pg_841" facs="0879"/>
                        <p>12. The President made no response to my question as to whether he would
                            consider retracting the press statement, and, as I have previously
                            indicated, I don't think that this would be politically feasible for him
                            to attempt. He also did not refer directly to the matter of enforcement,
                            but as I have already indicated, I would not think that he would go out
                            of his way to enforce or say he would enforce these provisions unless he
                            were forced into doing so.</p>
