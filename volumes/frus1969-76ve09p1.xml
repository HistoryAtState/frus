                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991,
                    established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>This statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations </hi>series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                        Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important foreign
                    policy decisions and actions during the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and
                    Gerald R. Ford. The advantage of this electronic-only method of presenting
                    documentation is evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access to
                    more key documentation on a broader range of <pb n="IV" facs="0005"
                        xml:id="pg_IV"/>issues. Annotation—the value-added element of documentary
                    editing—is still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a printed <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume. The Office of the Historian is
                    dedicated to publishing the great majority of the volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also
                    posted in electronic form on the Department of State’s website.</p>
                <p>This volume documents U.S. relations with North Africa from 1973 to 1976,
                    complementing several other volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                <p>The Maghreb presented opportunities and challenges for both the Nixon and Ford
                    administrations, as they sought to broker settlements to conflicts in the Middle
                    East and to limit Soviet exploitation of tensions in the region. Stability in
                    the Maghreb was considered vital to achieving these goals, but proved
                    increasingly difficult to attain due to Libya’s actions in the region and the
                    destabilizing impact of Spain’s withdrawal from Spanish Sahara.</p>
                <p>Documents on North Africa, 1973–1976, covers efforts by both administrations to
                    re-establish diplomatic relations with Algeria, and provide support and
                    reassurance to moderate Arab allies Morocco and Tunisia. It also covers the
                    various attempts to manage relations with Libya’s <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                        >Mu’ammar Qadhafi</persName>. Finally, the volume documents Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s efforts to de-escalate
                    growing tensions among Spain, Morocco, and Algeria following Spain’s May 1975
                    announcement that it would transfer sovereignty of Spanish Sahara.</p>
                <p>There are a limited number of documents covering bilateral relations with
                    Algeria, which were severed in June 1967. Telegrams between Washington and the
                    Interests Section in Algeria document the efforts that resulted in the
                    resumption of diplomatic relations in November 1974. Additional correspondence
                    and conversations with Algeria pertain to the Spanish Sahara and are found in
                    that compilation.</p>
                <p>The bilateral compilations on Morocco and Tunisia document U.S. efforts to
                    provide continued support, largely through military assistance. Interagency
                    memoranda along with telegrams to and from Rabat and Tunis show the strategies
                    utilized by the Nixon and Ford administrations to fulfill these arms requests in
                    the context of shrinking budgets. Memoranda of conversation between high-level
                    Moroccan and Tunisian officials with President Ford, <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, and De<pb n="V" facs="0006"
                        xml:id="pg_V"/>fense officials emphasize the central role these countries
                    played in the administration’s overarching goal for stability in the region.
                    They also detail Moroccan and Tunisian concerns over the perceived regional
                    threat posed by Libya and Algeria. Finally, memoranda and telegrams to and from
                    Rabat document interagency discussions regarding the disposition of U.S. bases
                    in Morocco.</p>
                <p>Libya presented both administrations with increasingly intractable problems.
                    Libyan attacks on U.S. planes flying over international waters led to a series
                    of high-level meetings, documented in meeting minutes, memoranda, and
                    interagency communications. Memoranda between the Department of State and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency reflect concerns over the inadequacy of U.S. policy
                    toward Libya developed in 1970, resulting in a new study, a Senior Review Group
                    meeting, and a follow-on options paper (<ref target="#d21">Documents 21</ref>,
                        <ref target="#d22">22</ref>, and <ref target="#d25">25</ref>). Deteriorating
                    relations between Egypt and Libya, and calls from Sadat for assistance to “deal
                    with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>,” are documented in
                    memoranda and telegrams to and from Cairo. There was also growing concern over
                    the threat <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> posed to the internal
                    security of many of Libya’s Arab and African neighbors, illustrated in
                    interagency memoranda and reports. Efforts to manage the growing diplomatic rift
                    between Tripoli and Washington, and avoid a break in diplomatic relations are
                    presented in telegrams and interagency memoranda.</p>
                <p>The Spanish Sahara was another source of instability in the Maghreb. The path to
                    sovereignty was fraught with tensions as Morocco, Mauritania and the Polisario
                    Front, backed by Algeria, jockeyed for control of the territory. Cognizant of
                    Morocco’s strategic importance, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> nevertheless needed to diffuse the situation while
                    maintaining U.S. neutrality on the issue. Memoranda of conversation between
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, Cortina, Hassan, and
                    Boumediene reflect the significance of the region to overall policy. <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s diplomatic efforts surrounding the
                    announcement of Hassan’s Green March, often conducted through cabled messages,
                    sought to avoid conflict between Morocco and Algeria, but largely ignored
                    Mauritania and the Polisario Front. Several intelligence reports examine the
                    future of the Spanish Sahara and the potential for continued conflict, while
                    cables transmit proposed strategies and guidance. Despite the efforts of
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and others, instability in
                    the region continued and the threat of conflict between Morocco and Algeria over
                    the Spanish Sahara (renamed Western Sahara in 1976) remained a source of concern
                    throughout the remainder of the Ford administration.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversations are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date a memorandum <pb n="VI" facs="0007"
                        xml:id="pg_VI"/>was drafted. Documents chosen for printing are authoritative
                    or signed copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
                    underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume. In telegrams, the
                    telegram number (including special designators such as Secto) is printed at the
                    start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provided
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used where appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for additional
                    restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights of former
                    Nixon White House officials, since these officials were not given the
                    opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the
                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA formally to notify
                    the Nixon Estate and former Nixon White House staff members that the agency is
                    scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical materials. The Nixon
                    Estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to contest the release
                    of Nixon historical materials in which they were a participant or are mentioned.
                    Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to segregate and
                    return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include materials from
                    NARA’s Nixon Presidential Materials Staff are processed and released in
                    accordance with the PRMPA.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and other applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security, as embodied in
                    law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed <pb n="VIII" facs="0009"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII"/>concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional
                    bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S.
                    Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents
                    of those governments. The declassification review of this volume, which began in
                    2007 and was completed in 2014, resulted in the decision to withhold 3 documents
                    in full, excise a paragraph or more in 5 documents, and make minor excisions of
                    less than a paragraph in 16 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the policy of the Nixon and
                    Ford administrations toward North Africa.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The 1991 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the
                    published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include
                    all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files through
                    July 1973 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office files covering the 1969–1976 period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or are in
                    the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents Nixon and Ford as well as other White House
                    foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dr. <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> has approved access to his
                    papers at the Library of Congress. These papers are a key source for the
                    Nixon-Ford subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>

                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, the Ford Presidential
                    Library, the Library of Congress, and other agencies. While all the material
                    printed in this volume has been declassified, some of it is extracted from still
                    classified documents. In the time since the research for this volume was
                    completed, the Nixon Presidential Materials have been transferred to the Nixon
                    Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. The Nixon
                    Presidential Library staff and Ford Library staff are processing and
                    declassifying many of the documents used in this volume, but they may not be
                    available in their entirety at the time of publication.</p>

                    1969–1976, Volume E–9, Part 1</p>
                <p>The presidential papers of the Nixon and Ford administrations are the best source
                    of high-level decision making documentation for U.S. relations with North Africa
                    from 1973 until 1976. At the Nixon Library, several collections from the
                    National Security Council Files are relevant to research on U.S.-North Africa
                    relations. The Country Files for Africa provide the NSC staff’s perspective on
                    relations with the Maghreb. The Institutional Files (H-Files) contain records on
                    high-level meetings, requests for studies, and presidential decisions.
                    High-level correspondence between President Nixon and foreign heads of state are
                    contained in the Presidential Correspondence files.</p>
                <p>Material at the Ford Library is organized into categories similar to those at the
                    Nixon Library. The National Security Adviser file contains a number of useful
                    collections for understanding U.S.-North Africa relations: Presidential Country
                    Files, Memoranda of Conversation, National Security Council Staff for the Middle
                    East and South Asia, Trip Briefing books, and the Presidential Agency File. The
                    President’s Daily Diary is an invaluable resource for following the President’s
                    work schedule. The Ford Library has separate NSC Institutional (H-Files), which
                    contain minutes and related documents for NSC and Senior Review Group meetings.
                    Also found in this collection are the Policy Paper files containing National
                    Security Study Memoranda (NSSMS), National Security Decision Memoranda (NSDMs),
                    and related documents.</p>
                <p>At the National Archives and Records Administration at College Park, Maryland,
                    the Department of State Central Files, 1970–1973, contains useful material on
                    the countries of North Africa. Focused largely on cable traffic to and from
                    posts, they contain analysis of events in country that have a bearing on U.S.
                    policy. This is especially true for the collections on Libya.</p>
                <p>The Kissinger Papers at the Library of Congress contain a significant amount of
                    duplicate material found in other repositories. However, the Geopolitical File
                    contains documents not found elsewhere, and the Memoranda of Conversations File
                    is remarkably comprehensive in scope. At the Department of Defense, the Official
                        <pb n="XIII" facs="0014" xml:id="pg_XIII"/>Records of the Secretary of
                    Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Special Assistant to the
                    Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the files of the Office of the
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs contain useful
                    documents on U.S. relations with the North Africa. The records of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency and the Intelligence Files at the National Security Council
                    contain valuable documentation for this volume.</p>

                        States</hi> statute that requires inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series of comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions, the editors have identified key documents regarding major
                    covert actions and intelligence activities. The following note will provide
                    readers with some organizational context on how covert actions and special
                    intelligence operations in support of U.S. foreign policy were planned and
                    approved within the U.S. Government. It describes, on the basis of declassified
                    documents, the changing and developing procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower,
                    Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford Presidencies.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Management of Covert Actions in the Truman Presidency</p>
                <p>The Truman administration’s concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in NSC 4–A of December 1947, the
                    launching of peacetime covert action operations. NSC 4–A made the Director of
                    Central Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the
                    same time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certainly was a natural choice
                    but it was assigned this function at least in part because the Agency controlled
                    unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with minimal risk of
                    exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="notesfn1">NSC 4–A, December 17, 1947,

                <p>The CIA’s early use of its new covert action mandate dissatisfied officials at
                    the Departments of State and Defense. The Department of State, believing this
                    role too important to be left to the CIA alone and concerned that the military
                    might create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen
                    the issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new NSC directive, NSC 10/2, superseded NSC
                    4–A.</p>
                <p>NSC 10/2 directed the CIA to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any
                    US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and
                    that if un<pb n="XXII" facs="0023" xml:id="pg_XXII"/>covered the US Government
                    can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.”</p>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
                    demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
                    assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] groups, and support of indigenous
                    anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such
                    operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces,
                    espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military
                        operations.”<note n="2" xml:id="notesfn2">NSC 10/2, June 18, 1948, is

                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the CIA on
                    September 1, 1948, in accordance with NSC 10/2, assumed responsibility for
                    organizing and managing covert actions. The OPC, which was to take its guidance
                    from the Department of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime,
                    initially had direct access to the State Department and to the military without
                    having to proceed through the CIA’s administrative hierarchy, provided the
                    Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was informed of all important projects
                    and decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="notesfn3">Memorandum of conversation by Frank
                        G. Wisner, “Implementation of NSC10/2,” August 12, 1948, is printed ibid.,

                    this arrangement was modified to ensure that policy guidance came to the OPC
                    through the DCI.</p>
                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of the CIA’s activities. Concerned about this situation, DCI Walter
                    Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the NSC for enhanced policy guidance and a
                    ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of CIA operations. The White House
                    responded with two initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the
                    Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the NSC to coordinate government-wide
                    psychological warfare strategy. NSC 10/5, issued in October 1951, reaffirmed the
                    covert action mandate given in NSC 10/2 and expanded the CIA’s authority over
                    guerrilla warfare.<note n="4" xml:id="notesfn4">NSC 10/5, “Scope and Pace of

                    was soon abolished by the incoming Eisenhower administration, but the expansion
                    of the CIA’s covert action writ in NSC 10/5 helped ensure that covert action
                    would remain a major function of the Agency.</p>
                <p>As the Truman administration ended, the CIA was near the peak of its independence
                    and authority in the field of covert action. Although the CIA continued to seek
                    and receive advice on specific projects from the NSC, the PSB, and the
                    departmental representatives origi<pb n="XXIII" facs="0024" xml:id="pg_XXIII"
                    />nally delegated to advise the OPC, no group or officer outside of the DCI and
                    the President himself had authority to order, approve, manage, or curtail
                    operations.</p>

                    Committee</p>
                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing the CIA’s latitude in 1954. In
                    accordance with a series of National Security Council directives, the
                    responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence for the conduct of covert
                    operations was further clarified. President Eisenhower approved NSC 5412 on
                    March 15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency’s responsibility for
                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with designated representatives of
                    the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that covert
                    operations were planned and conducted in a manner consistent with U.S. foreign
                    and military policies; and the Operations Coordinating Board was designated the
                    normal channel for coordinating support for covert operations among State,
                    Defense, and the CIA. Representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary
                    of Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance of major covert
                    action programs initiated by the CIA under this policy and were to give policy
                    approval for such programs and secure coordination of support among the
                    Departments of State and Defense and the CIA.<note n="5" xml:id="notesfn5"

                <p>A year later, on March 12, 1955, NSC 5412/1 was issued, identical to NSC 5412
                    except for designating the Planning Coordination Group as the body responsible
                    for coordinating covert operations. NSC 5412/2 of December 28, 1955, assigned to
                    representatives (of the rank of assistant secretary) of the Secretary of State,
                    the Secretary of Defense, and the President responsibility for coordinating
                    covert actions. By the end of the Eisenhower administration, this group, which
                    became known as the “NSC 5412/2 Special Group” or simply “Special Group,”
                    emerged as the executive body to review and approve covert action programs
                    initiated by the CIA.<note n="6" xml:id="notesfn6">Leary, <hi rend="italic">The

                    Neither the CIA nor the Special Group adopted fixed criteria for bringing
                    projects before the group; initiative remained with the CIA, as members

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President Kennedy’s request and submitted a report
                    in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert
                    operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the
                    President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and
                    including Deputy Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson, Deputy Secretary of
                    Defense Roswell Gilpatric, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, and
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater
                    responsibility for planning and reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the DCI
                    determined whether a CIA-originated project was submitted to the Special Group.
                    In 1963 the Special Group developed general but informal criteria, including
                    risk, possibility of success, potential for exposure, political sensitivity, and
                    cost (a threshold of $25,000 was adopted by the CIA), for determining whether
                    covert action projects were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8"
                        xml:id="notesfn8">Ibid., p. 82.</note></p>
                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General Robert Kennedy and
                    General Taylor (as Chairman), exercised responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a
                    major covert action program aimed at overthrowing the Castro regime in Cuba.
                    When President Kennedy authorized the program in November, he designated
                    Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale, Assistant for Special Operations to the
                    Secretary of Defense, to act as chief of operations, and Lansdale coordinated
                    the Mongoose activities among the CIA and the Departments of State and Defense.
                    The CIA units in Washington and Miami had primary responsibility for
                    implementing Mongoose operations, which included military, sabotage, and
                    political propaganda programs.<note n="9" xml:id="notesfn9">See <ref

                <p>President Kennedy also established a Special Group (Counter-Insurgency) on
                    January 18, 1962, when he signed NSAM No. 124. The Special Group (CI), set up to
                    coordinate counter-insurgency activities separate from the mechanism for
                    implementing NSC 5412/2, was to confine itself to establishing broad policies
                    aimed at preventing and resisting subversive insurgency and other forms of
                    indirect aggression in friendly countries. In early 1966, in NSAM No. 341,
                    President Johnson assigned responsibility for the direction and coordination of
                    counter-insurgency activities overseas to the Secretary of State, who
                    established <pb n="XXV" facs="0026" xml:id="pg_XXV"/>a Senior Interdepartmental

                    not alter its composition, functions, or responsibility. Bundy was the chairman
                    of the 303 Committee.<note n="11" xml:id="notesfn11">For text of NSAM No. 303,

                <p>The Special Group and the 303 Committee approved 163 covert actions during the
                    Kennedy administration and 142 during the Johnson administration through
                    February 1967. The 1976 Final Report of the Church Committee, however, estimated
                    that of the several thousand projects undertaken by the CIA since 1961, only 14
                    percent were considered on a case-by-case basis by the 303 Committee and its
                    predecessors (and successors). Those not reviewed by the 303 Committee were
                    low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a February 1967
                    CIA memorandum that included a description of the mode of policy arbitration of
                    decisions on covert actions within the 303 Committee system. The CIA
                    presentations were questioned, amended, and even on occasion denied, despite
                    protests from the DCI. Department of State objections modified or nullified
                    proposed operations, and the 303 Committee sometimes decided that some agency
                    other than the CIA should undertake an operation or that CIA actions requested
                    by Ambassadors on the scene should be rejected.<note n="12" xml:id="notesfn12"

                <p>The effectiveness of covert action has always been difficult for any
                    administration to gauge, given concerns about security and the difficulty of
                    judging the impact of U.S. initiatives on events. In October 1969 the new Nixon
                    administration required annual 303 Committee reviews for all covert actions that
                    the Committee had approved and automatic termination of any operation not
                    reviewed after 12 months. On February 17, 1970, President Nixon signed National
                    Security Decision Memorandum 40,<note n="13" xml:id="notesfn13">For text of NSDM

                    superseded NSC 5412/2 and changed the name of the covert action approval group
                    to the 40 Committee, in part because the 303 Committee had been named in the
                    media. The Attorney General was also added to the membership of the Committee.
                    NSDM 40 reaffirmed the DCI’s responsibility for the coordination, control, and
                    conduct of covert operations and directed him to obtain policy approval from the
                    40 Committee for all major and “politically sensitive” <pb n="XXVI" facs="0027"
                        xml:id="pg_XXVI"/>covert operations. He was also made responsible for
                    ensuring an annual review by the 40 Committee of all approved covert
                    operations.</p>
                <p>The 40 Committee met regularly early in the Nixon administration, but over time
                    the number of formal meetings declined and business came to be conducted via
                    couriers and telephone votes. The Committee actually met only for major new
                    proposals. As required, the DCI submitted annual status reports to the 40
                    Committee for each approved operation. According to the 1976 Church Committee
                    Final Report, the 40 Committee considered only about 25 percent of the CIA’s
                    individual covert action projects, concentrating on major projects that provided
                    broad policy guidelines for all covert actions. Congress received briefings on
                    only a few proposed projects. Not all major operations, moreover, were brought
                    before the 40 Committee: President Nixon in 1970 instructed the DCI to promote a
                    coup d’ etat against Chilean President Salvador Allende without Committee
                    coordination or approval.<note n="14" xml:id="notesfn14"><hi rend="italic">Final

                <p>The Hughes-Ryan amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 brought about a
                    major change in the way the U.S. Government approved covert actions, requiring
                    explicit approval by the President for each action and expanding Congressional
                    oversight and control of the CIA. The CIA was authorized to spend appropriated
                    funds on covert actions only after the President had signed a “finding” and
                    informed Congress that the proposed operation was important to national

                <p>Executive Order 11905, issued by President Ford on February 18, 1976, in the wake
                    of major Congressional investigations of CIA activities by the Church and Pike
                    Committees, replaced the 40 Committee with the Operations Advisory Group,

                    Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
                    the DCI, who retained responsibility for the planning and implementation of
                    covert operations. The OAG was required to hold formal meetings to develop
                    recommendations for the President regarding a covert action and to conduct
                    periodic reviews of previously-approved operations. EO 11905 also banned all
                    U.S. Government employees from involvement in political assassinations, a
                    prohibition that was retained in succeeding executive orders, and prohibited

                            toward a Middle East settlement. As a result, he will be an important
                            positive influence in the Syrian negotiations.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> reiterated his hope
                            that our efforts will succeed in bringing about a successful
                            Syrian-Israeli disengagement, though he noted Asad’s concern that the
                            process on Israeli withdrawal continue after the disengagement phase. I
                            assured him that we are committed to the implementation of the relevant
                            Security Council resolutions and to a just and lasting overall
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>“We had a good discussion about the Soviet problem. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> urged me not to agree to
                            meet with Gromyko in any Arab capital because this would be demeaning to
                            the Arabs. I agreed, leaving open a <pb n="2" facs="0029" xml:id="pg_2"
                            />meeting at the end of the trip outside the area. He also stated his
                            firm conviction that after a settlement in the area, the Soviets would
                            be unable to compete with the United States in any field of endeavor in
                            the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>“Our talks also accelerated the momentum toward resumption of diplomatic
                            relations and a deepening of our overall economic relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said he wants to resume
                            formal diplomatic relations with us after the Syrian-Israeli
                            disengagement has been achieved and before the Geneva Conference
                            convenes. He sees this as a matter of only weeks.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> told me that he is
                            anxious to encourage joint ventures with American companies, in fields
                            such as refineries, fertilizers, truck factories and iron and steel
                            plants. He cites the more favorable political climate between our
                            countries and Algeria’s good credit rating as reasons the EX-IM Bank and
                            other institutions should look favorably on Algerian projects. I agreed
                            in principle to be helpful while at the same time pointing out that we
                            could not guarantee favorable decisions for each project.</p>
                        <p>“In short, these talks fully reflected the marked improvement in our
                            bilateral relations begun by your talks two weeks ago. They should
                            establish a base for a positive role for Algeria in the disengagement
                            agreement and in the Middle East in general.</p>
                        <p>“Finally, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> told me that
                            he hoped you would come to Algiers if you visit the area.</p>

                            judgment is that he and President Asad will coordinate question of
                            renewing relations very closely between them and that this will depend
                            in large measure on outcome of current disengagement negotiations, which
                            not yet certain. Meanwhile, we should not be pressing Algerians on this,
                            although I will of course be interested in any readings they may
                            volunteer to you. In any case, I do not plan stop in Algiers on return

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I am writing to give you this advance word that it has been agreed
                            between us and the Syrian Government that we shall announce the
                            resumption of diplomatic relations during President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s visit to Syria next week. In
                            view of our previous discussions and in keeping with my continuing
                            desire to keep you advised of new developments in the Middle East
                            situation, I wanted to share this information with you prior to the
                            formal public announcement.</p>

                        <p>We have in the past discussed the question of a resumption of relations
                            between our two countries, and I simply want to reaffirm to you that we
                            remain prepared for such a step whenever your government feels that the
                            circumstances are propitious. This is, of course, entirely a decision
                            for you to make, Mr. President, and we shall continue to abide by your
                            judgment in this regard.</p>
                        <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> has written
                            you, the demands on his time unfortunately do not permit him to visit
                            your country in the course of his forthcoming trip. This is a matter of
                            particular regret to me, since it also deprives me of the pleasure of
                            again visiting with you. I still have very warm memories of my meetings
                            with you and of your warm hospitality at the beginning of my recent
                            visit to the area to negotiate the Syrian-Israeli disengagement
                            agreement.</p>

                            momentum must not be lost in Middle East, that Israeli raids on Lebanon
                            were unhelpful and that U.S. should use its influence with Iran to
                            prevent trouble on “eastern front” in Kurdistan. He expressed general
                            satisfaction re economic relations but some concern over future gas
                            contracts with U.S. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            did not commit himself to a date for resumption diplomatic relations but

                            summary</p>
                        <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> received
                            me for farewell call afternoon June 28. After usual exchange for such
                            occasions, he went over theme already known to Secretary to effect that
                            U.S.-Algerian bilateral relations have never encountered serious
                            problems though major differences had divided two countries in
                            international sphere, particularly re Vietnam and Middle East. U.S., he
                            said, was powerful enough to conduct its policies in third world without
                            threats or use of force and without relying on person such as Lon Nol.
                            Communist world was divided and faced many problems.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> referred to
                            evolution of U.S. policy in Middle East and asked that I pass to
                            Secretary his view that it was necessary to maintain momentum. Meanwhile
                            he was disturbed by Israel’s raids on Lebanon which could endanger
                            movement toward peace. He hoped <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            would give full weight to Palestinian problem in months ahead.</p>
                        <p>4. (With Vice Premier of Iraq Saddam Hussein in town) <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> asked that I express to
                            Secretary his concern over developments in Kurdistan and his hope that
                            U.S. would use its influence with Iran to ensure that territorial
                            integrity of Iraq was not threatened.</p>
                        <p>5. Re Middle East I referred to the Secretary’s recent messages to him. I
                            observed that absence of public declarations did not mean that American
                            leadership was neglecting Middle East, nor did it mean that we condoned
                            Israeli raids on Lebanon. Intensive efforts would be continued
                            throughout summer to prepare for Geneva talks. We were aware of dangers
                            to this effort posed by clashes between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
                        <p>6. Re Kurdistan I assured <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            supported territorial integrity of states in area including Iraq. It
                            would be mistake to overestimate our influence on Iranians who
                            considered Kurdish question to be their affair and subject on which they
                            did not appreciate outside advice. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> interjected that in confidence he could tell
                            us he had advised Iraqis to improve their relations with U.S. They were
                            considering doing so including resumption diplomatic relations. I
                            replied that this would be helpful as means to improve communications
                            and remove their suspicions regarding our policies.</p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="0033" xml:id="pg_6"/>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> also briefly
                            mentioned Cuba as a country which did not have natural ties with Soviet
                            Union and wished rather to develop ties “within its natural
                            environment”. I replied that problem had been Cuba’s desire to export
                            revolution and interfere in neighboring countries. He acknowledged this
                            but thought their attitude had changed.</p>
                        <p>8. I asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> saw
                            any problems on economic front. He replied in negative but asked what
                            was delaying El Paso II and other gas projects. I replied that
                            formulation of our own energy policy, including that related to gas
                            prices, was one cause of delay. We would like to have assured source of
                            Algerian gas at competitive price. He agreed that this was desirable and
                            noted that security of gas projects would be strengthened by renewal of
                            diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>9. I asked whether he had any thoughts re Secretary’s suggestion that
                            U.S. and Algeria give structure to their economic relationship through
                            creation of a joint commission or in any other way Algerians might
                            suggest. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> replied that
                            this was being studied.</p>
                        <p>10. During discussion of U.S.-Algerian relations <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said in measured but
                            somewhat vague terms that resumption of diplomatic relations would occur
                            soon and that action in this regard would be set in motion following
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>’s return from Kuala
                            Lumpur (probably next week). I reiterated Secretary’s message that this
                            was for President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to
                            decide. At close of conversation <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> agreed that there would be no reason to name
                            a replacement Chief of USINT since Ambassadors would soon be
                            exchanged.</p>

                        <p>2. Begin Message.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has been
                            considering question of assigning a new head of the U.S. Interests
                            Section in Algiers. In this connection, he recalls President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s comment during Mr.
                            Eagleton’s farewell call that there would be no need to name a
                            replacement for Mr. Eagleton since Ambassadors would soon be exchanged.
                            At the same time, the Secretary is reluctant to have a long period pass
                            without a senior American representative in Algiers in view of the
                            importance he attaches to U.S.-Algerian relations and to his personal
                            relationship with the President. The Secretary is therefore considering
                            nominating an American representative of Ambassadorial rank as head of
                            the Interests Section, with the thought that he could then be named as
                            our Ambassador in Algiers at such time as diplomatic relations are
                            restored. Before taking any action in this regard, the Secretary would
                            appreciate knowing whether this would be agreeable to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>. End message.</p>

                        <p>1. During discussion mainly on other subject July 19, Algerian Amb
                            Dellici took initiative to raise subject of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Algerian diplomatic relations. He recounted that when
                            former Secy <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> had been in
                            Rabat, Moroccans had called him to meet with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> privately. During meeting,
                            Algerian had said two obstacles—Vietnam and Middle East conflict—stood
                            between <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Algeria. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> had replied that Vietnam would
                            end; but no one could make firm predictions about <gloss
                                target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss> conflict. Algerian had telephoned
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> same night to
                            report this conversation, and <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> had told him that if <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> could arrive at “half-solutions” for these problems
                            which would eventually lead to full solutions, Algeria could resume
                            diplomatic relations.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked that
                            you be provided with the following report of his meeting with Algerian
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“I had a three-hour talk with President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> in Algiers, on the evening of Monday, October
                            14.</p>
                        <p>“Algeria is not directly concerned with the territorial issues in the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict, but, from its history as a revolutionary Arab
                            nationalist regime, feels deeply about the principle of justice for the
                            Arab and particularly the Palestinian cause. Algeria has great prestige
                            in the Arab world, if not decisive influence, and therefore it was
                            valuable to ensure that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> had a thorough and sympathetic understanding
                            of what we are attempting to do. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> is highly intelligent and sophisticated. He
                            warmly recalled meeting you, and expressed interest in meeting you again
                            at some future time. He said he would be pleased if his Foreign
                            Minister, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>, could meet
                            with you in Washington sometime in the first half of December.</p>
                        <p>“I reassured him of your determination to continue the American effort to
                            produce progress. We discussed the domestic situation here and in
                            Israel, and the particular tactical considerations we had to face before
                            our Congressional elections. I told him I was confident that we would
                            overcome the domestic obstacles, as we had done so far. There were
                            uncertainties, but the process was not reversible. He wished there were
                            greater clarity about the final objective, but he did not basically
                            object to the step-by-step approach. He assured me that most of the
                            Arabs trusted us, perhaps even more than they trusted their own
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> showed complete
                            understanding of our negative vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> on the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. The results
                            came in while we were talking. He understood that our negative vote was
                            essential domestically to preserve our ability to continue on course. It
                            would make my mission easier, he commented.</p>

                        <p>“I asked for his analysis of King Hussein’s position. His view, rather
                            disturbingly, was that King Hussein had no role to play any longer and
                            that it was simply a matter of form how to return the West Bank to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. He thought that making King
                            Hussein the negotiator with Israel only complicated matters. It would
                            weaken the moderate leadership of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss>, which he thought was ultimately prepared to coexist
                            with Israel. He thought we should deal directly with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. I informed him that the U.S. would
                            begin communicating with the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> on a
                            political level in late November. He was very pleased with this.</p>
                        <p>“We discussed energy prices, in which <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> shared surprising sympathy. Though he
                            mentioned his position, he praised support for our objective of not
                            having prices raised. He even asked what I had in mind for a strategy to
                            get prices lowered and implied that a political price cut could even be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> talked
                            enthusiastically about bilateral U.S.-Algerian relations. He agreed on
                            restoring diplomatic relations and asked only that we delay a few weeks
                            until after the Arab summit. We set the date of November 12 for the
                            joint announcement of resumption. He then waxed eloquent about the huge
                            joint economic projects that he wanted to launch with the U.S.—billion
                            dollar truck factories, engine factories, iron and steel complexes, as
                            well as oil and gas. I told him I would send my new Under Secretary for
                            Economic Affairs to Algiers in the next two to three weeks; <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said he would receive him
                            personally.</p>
                        <p>“At the end of the meeting, I conferred privately with him. He offered to
                            transmit messages privately from us to his two revolutionary friends,
                            Prince Sihanouk and Fidel Castro. I told him he could convey to both, in
                            general terms, our willingness to deal with them if they were willing to
                            act as genuinely independent and nonaligned, and not in the pocket of
                            the Communists.</p>
                        <p>“My talk with <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was warm
                            and open. He encouraged me to speak to the press in positive terms about
                            our relations on my departure. It is most encouraging to me that he
                            showed understanding of our Middle East strategy. At the forthcoming
                            Arab summit in Rabat, Algeria may perhaps use its influence in the
                            direction of moderation.</p>
                        <p>“Today, I will stop in Rabat for a brief talk with King Hassan on my way
                            back to Washington.”</p>

                        <opener>
                            <salute>Dear Henry:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>In accordance with our discussion at the <gloss target="#t_WSAG_1"
                                >WSAG</gloss>, this letter provides you with a discussion of options
                            available to the U.S. Government to respond to the attempted shoot-down
                            on 21 March of a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] C–130 by the Libyan Air Force, and our
                            recommended course of action.</p>
                        <p>In considering our actions, we must give weight to two factors:</p>
                        <p>a. Our aircraft was proceeding in international air space. The Libyan
                            Government establishment of a restricted area within 100 n.m. of Tripoli
                            is not recognized by the U.S. Government and we have lodged formal
                            protest with the Libyan Government concerning their unilateral and
                            illegal declaration of air space control. The Libyan attack on our
                            aircraft was unprovoked and illegal and if not met by an appropriate
                            response from the U.S. Government, it will reinforce the Libyan
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>b. It is our objective to maintain diplomatic relations with the Libyan
                            Government both to maintain contact with this government and to
                            represent the some 3,000 U.S. citizens in this country and our very
                            substantial (in excess of $1 billion) investments in Libya.</p>
                        <p>Outlined below are four options for response with associated pros and
                            cons.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Option 1. Diplomatic Protest Only. We could make our
                                position clear again that we do not recognize the Libyan claim and
                                regard their attack upon <pb n="13" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_13"/>our
                                aircraft as an illegal and unwarranted act that will certainly
                                affect relationships between our countries. In addition, we could
                                threaten, or act, to withhold sales of military equipment to the
                                Libyan Government.</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pros.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) Presents minimum potential for open conflict, break in diplomatic
                            relations or actions against U.S. citizens or property.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Libyan Government needs our support for U.S. military equipment.
                            Its loss could certainly limit their utilization of this equipment;
                            i.e., F–5 and C–130 aircraft.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) We have delivered protests before on the Libyan claims on air space.
                            A diplomatic protest would be viewed as a weak and ineffective
                            response.</p>
                        <p>(2) Our leverage with respect to military equipment is limited. It is
                            possible that the support required by the Libyan Government could be
                            obtained from other sources.</p>
                        <p>(3) Denial of U.S. military equipment (spares) would increase prospects
                            for Soviet military sales and influence in Libya.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Option 2. We could assert our right to fly through
                                this air space by using a high performance combat aircraft that
                                would have the intrinsic capability of self-defense.</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pros.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) This would afford us the opportunity to assert our right to fly in
                            this air space. The aircraft transitting would, by definition, have the
                            ability to meet and counter any Libyan reaction. [<hi rend="italic">2½
                                lines not declassified</hi>] In those cases we elected to replace
                            vulnerable platforms with one more appropriate to the threat.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) A response with combat or high performance aircraft alone would not
                            provide the desired parallelism between the earlier mission and our
                            response.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Option 3. We could respond by sending a C–130
                                aircraft non-reconnaissance equipped, escorted by combat
                                aircraft.</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pros.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) This option would afford the apparent parallelism between the flight
                            challenged on 21 March and our response, i.e., a transport type
                            aircraft. The provision of armed escort would correspond to the actions
                            that we took in responding to the North Korean.</p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_14"/>
                        <p>(2) The provision of armed escort should give us a high assurance that
                            the mission could be completed successfully without incurring loss of
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons.</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) This mission composition does place at risk a transport aircraft with
                            little intrinsic capability for self-defense. Even with an escort there
                            is a risk that the transport aircraft could be lost.</p>
                        <p>(2) [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>(3) Given the irrational and irresponsible nature of the Libyan
                            leadership, we might well find the U.S. in the position of shooting down
                            one or more Libyan fighter aircraft. The issue of U.S. legal rights
                            would become lost in the emotional aftermath that could critically
                            undercut moderate Arab leaders and help unify the various extremist
                            elements of the Arab world. U.S. lives in Libya and elsewhere would be
                            placed in increased jeopardy as the fedayeen mounted reprisals.</p>

                        <p>Same as Option 3 above [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] It is my recommendation that our responses be
                            either Option 3 or Option 4. Details of these two options were forwarded

                            Policy Questions re Recon Flights Off Libya.</p>
                        <p>Summary: This message asks for more-specific assurances than received to
                            date that certain policy considerations have been fed into decision to
                            proceed with another [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] recon flight off Libya tomorrow. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. By separate channel I was informed April 10 that decision has been
                            made at highest level to resume Mediterranean recon flights, and that
                            the first one was scheduled for that day. The message added that the
                            considerations I had raised (Tripoli 0370) had been taken fully into
                            account but that there was an overriding need clearly to assert our
                            rights of transit. Later I was informed that the first flight had been
                            postponed for 48 hours. Whether this was a result of comments I made in
                            flash reply through the same channel is not clear. My message had
                            expressed understanding of the basic decision to proceed with the
                            flights off Libya in order to maintain our rights of transit but had
                            expressed hope that way could be found so that they would not aggravate
                                <gloss target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss> situation or lead to end of this
                            diplomatic mission. I observed that the flight scheduled for later that
                            day did not appear to meet either of these criteria because of its
                            timing and that diplomacy should be allowed to operate before we assert
                            our rights by force. I requested a final review whether to proceed with
                            the April 10 flight.</p>
                        <p>2. Among the questions asked in Tripoli 0370 of March 26 was: “Has
                            consideration been given recently to alternative ways of collection,
                            including use of satellites, while preserving the principle of freedom
                            of navigation on and over the high seas by occasional and less obvious
                            transit patterns.” Assume that the answer to this question is “yes”, and
                            that in any case these flights, having been challenged, must proceed. I
                            repeat that this basic decision is understandable to us here and indeed
                            was expected, but we submit that how we resume flights is equally
                            important. We are still concerned about the timing of the first flight
                            in view of predictable Arab reactions to Israeli raid on Beirut <pb
                                n="17" facs="0044" xml:id="pg_17"/>April 9–10. Furthermore, we are
                            concerned about some important details of the instructions given to the
                            pilots of our fighters who are to accompany the [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] we are raising our questions
                            about this matter in another channel.</p>
                        <p>3. Regarding the timing, my understanding had been that flights would not
                            resume until situation had been studied further and time allowed for
                            diplomatic action to take place here and have an educative effect. The
                            action was taken, very satisfactorily, on April 10 (Tripoli 0449).
                            Moreover, when seeing same <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> official
                            today, on other business, <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss>
                            received assurance our démarche had been reported to higher authorities.
                            Still, a recon flight tomorrow rushes things. We have had to spend many
                            hours ourselves pouring over documents and maps to understand all
                            aspects of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> legal position under
                            international law. Can we reasonably expect <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss>, which not noted for either its coordination or its
                            speed, to digest what we have presented and within 48 hours reconsider
                            its own position in the light thereof? We think not, and do not
                            understand overriding urgency apparently attached to performing our next
                            C–130 flight. Our differences with the rulers of Tripoli over transit
                            rights go back to 1801, when it took four years to educate them. They
                            have now heard from us again on the subject—but only yesterday, in
                            writing on the complex details.</p>
                        <p>4. In any case the <gloss target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss> situation, of which
                            the LAR is part and parcel, happens to be in one of its most tense
                            phases in years. Overtones we are getting from Beirut and Cairo, as well
                            as here, are of most extreme anti-American sentiment since June 1967
                            War, marked by wild but locally credible allegations of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> complicity with Israeli “aggression”
                            if not primary responsibility therefor. Fact that we have publicly
                            “deplored” both Israeli and fedayeen actions of last two days does help,
                            but assume our emphasis now must be on quiet measures to calm situation.
                            How could another recon flight and inevitable <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> knowledge of it, not to mention an interception
                            incident, fit into this general posture we presumably wish to project?
                            If <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> publicizes its knowledge, as
                            quite possible in its present mode of extreme edginess, most Arabs
                            likely to interpret flight as deliberate “protective reaction” to
                            prevent <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> retaliation against
                            Israeli interests in Mediterranean. We do not think that such a linkage
                            is what we want to convey or that need to show our right to overfly
                            Mediterranean is so urgent as to risk the connection being drawn.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> announced today that
                            as the burials at Beirut are to be held afternoon of April 12, a popular
                            demonstration will be held at Tripoli at same hour (1700 or 1800 local
                            time).</p>
                        <p>6. Would appreciate an assurance such considerations are being taken into
                            account now, and notification as early as possible of final outcome of
                            review.</p>

                        <p>In 1972 Libya declared a “restricted area” reaching 100 miles around its
                            capital. We protested, citing international law and custom which
                            prevented restricting freedom of airspace over the high seas and advised
                            Libya that we would adhere to international aviation practices. On a
                            regular basis we have flown reconnaissance missions over international
                            waters in the Central Mediterranean, including Libya’s “restricted
                            area,” without incident.</p>
                        <p>On 21 March two Libyan aircraft fired at and attempted to force down a
                            U.S. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            reconnaissance aircraft which was about 82 nautical miles off Libya. We
                            have reiterated our right to fly in international waters to Libyan civil
                            air officials and, on 10 April, to the Libyan Foreign Ministry. The
                            issues are complicated and Libyan officials are likely to take
                            considerable time to study them before responding.</p>
                        <p>What is at issue is our right to freedom of air space over international
                            waters. The Libyan attack was unprovoked and clearly illegal. If not met
                            with an appropriate response from the U.S. Government, Libya’s claims
                            will be reinforced. There is a consensus that we should establish our
                            rights by resuming reconnaissance operations off Libya.</p>

                        <p>Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> propose to provide

                            similar to that of 21 March except that it would proceed point-to-point
                            without any orbits en route and would be manned by a reduced crew. The
                            escort would be provided by an aircraft carrier in the area. The closest
                            point of approach to Libya would be 75 nautical miles.</p>
                        <p>The arguments <hi rend="italic">for</hi> this proposal include:</p>
                        <p>—To establish our right to operate in international airspace.</p>
                        <p>—To confirm our refusal to accept Libya’s (or any other) unilateral,

                        <p>—To resume collection of intelligence information on the Middle East,
                            including Soviet involvement in the area.</p>
                        <p>—To provide some degree of protection to our aircraft as it conducts

                        <p>—To prevent Libya from claiming that this is the way to deal with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The arguments <hi rend="italic">against</hi> this proposal include:</p>
                        <p>—We may be accused of resorting to military means to assert our
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>—Arabs will exploit any incident as “proof” of our collusion with Israel,
                            specifically in the recent Beirut raid, but generally as well.</p>
                        <p>—Libya’s reaction might be to seek ways to retaliate rather than be
                            subdued by our show of force.</p>
                        <p>—Libya’s planes are on “strip alert” and are equipped with air-to-air
                            missiles. They are “prepared” for Israeli air attacks and might mistake
                            our mission and attack. There are also indications Libya is looking for
                            an opportunity to create an incident as an excuse for a total break with
                            the U.S. In any event, our planes could be threatened. Even with an
                            escort, there is a risk our reconnaissance aircraft could be lost.</p>
                        <p>—Middle East anti-U.S. emotions are being inflamed as an aftermath of
                            Israel’s raid on Lebanon and a U.S.-Libya incident would add fuel to the
                            fire, possibly endangering the 3,000 Americans in Libya and the major
                            oil investments there.</p>
                        <p>There are risks involved, but I believe we should not delay much longer
                            the assertion of our right to operate in international airspace. To do
                            so would only invite similar challenges elsewhere and even bolder
                            challenges by Libya. Anti-American demonstrations in the area can be
                            expected to lessen after today’s funeral services in Lebanon for those
                            killed in the Israeli raid and the simultaneous observances in Libya. We
                            can monitor these sentiments over the next few days before scheduling a
                            reconnaissance mission with armed escort. In any event, it is probably
                            desirable to wait until Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> departs Algeria on 16 April before conducting the
                            proposed mission. In addition, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> recommends that we delay the flight for a few
                            days at least (Tab A). We could further reduce the risks by notifying
                            the Libyan Govern<pb n="20" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_20"/>ment of our
                            intentions in advance, which also would establish that any provocation
                            would be at their hand, not ours.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>That you approve armed escort of a reconnaissance flight off Libya on 17

                            discussions or agency positions on the Libyan situation.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here are conclusions unrelated to Libya.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> coming to the meeting?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eagleburger: He’ll be here as soon as he can. I’ll do the best I can
                            to substitute for him until he arrives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: First, I want to
                            discuss these flights off Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I understand the
                            flight is in a go position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have received
                            more messages from our Chargé in Libya during the past week than from
                            our Ambassador in Cambodia, where a shooting war is going on, in a year.
                            The Chargé has now figured out that the rules of engagement for the
                            flight over the Mediterranean are dangerous. I must admit that our
                            Chargé in Tripoli has a point there. If the Libyans are willing to shoot
                            down our planes at a range of fifty miles out at sea, we have to be sure
                            the rules of engagement are very carefully drawn. What are they,
                            anyway?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: The rules we have
                            imposed are so severe that the fighter pilots must be smarting about
                            them. The admiral in command of the Task Force must declare an aircraft
                            hostile before our fighters can attack it, and he has very strict
                            requirements that must be met before he can declare an aircraft hostile.
                            The approaching aircraft must move into position to attack our planes,
                            or be vectored toward one of them, or be ordered to fire on them, [<hi

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the range
                            you are referring to?</p>

                            who is sending us these messages. What is his name?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I’m satisfied. I
                            would like to give the exercise some visibility and provide advance
                            notice to the Libyans. Otherwise, the rules of engagement are in the
                            area of technology and if Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1"

                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I think ours will

                            let the Libyans know two hours ahead of time?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: My understanding was
                            that we were not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: The Greeks are out.
                            We don’t plan to notify them, but I think we should inform the Libyans
                            in advance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Adm. <persName

                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I don’t think we
                            should give them any advance notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: If we do, how much

                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] is coming
                            by.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Then you will have
                            established a precedent. Every time we want to fly over the area, we
                            will have to notify the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: No, not every time,
                            only under special circumstances. This is a very special situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: What is the
                            purpose of the warning? Can it reach a high level in the Libyan
                            Government in two hours, a high-enough level for them to make a decision
                            about it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I don’t care whether
                            it reaches a high level or not. We want to do it for the record. We’ll
                            do whatever we can to establish the record that we gave them advance
                            notice. If necessary, we’ll throw a rock with a note tied to it through
                            the Foreign Office window.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I have no problem
                            with giving them notice for the record.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This would not be
                            done in connection with any other country, would it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: No. I prefer just to
                            tell the Libyans and to tell them only the bare fact of the flight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM_1">Al (Haig)</persName>, you’re shaking your head,
                            what’s your objection?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>: If we give them a
                            warning, it is likely to make it more of a test of manhood for the
                            Libyans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I understand what you
                            are saying, but I think we should do it.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: The trouble is, a
                            warning gives them time to get their aircraft armed with missiles and it
                            could make it more dangerous for our planes.</p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_23"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I’m not saying we
                            have to give them a lot of notice. We can just give them one or two
                            minutes and still make the record of having notified them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eagleburger: If we have to notify them, why not do it just as our
                            planes are entering their radar screens?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It would be hard to
                            tell when that will happen.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: No it’s not, it’s
                            very easy. We know exactly when that will happen, at 2 p.m. Washington
                            time, or 9 a.m. Libya time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eagleburger: If you’re going to give them two hours notice, you’ll
                            never find anyone in the Foreign Office at 7 a.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Don’t worry, we’ll
                            find someone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carver: When it is 2 p.m. in Washington, isn’t it 9 p.m. in
                            Libya?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: No, the flyby will
                            take place at 2 a.m. Washington time, which is 9 a.m. Libya time. Maybe
                            I said it wrong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why not give them
                            less than two hours notice? What about one hour?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: We could do it
                            indefinitely by just telling them that we will be passing through
                            international air space, without saying when.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I don’t think it
                            makes any difference what we tell them. They are going to lie about it
                            anyway, so why not do it to suit ourselves. We don’t want to do it in a
                            way that gives them a big advantage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right, I
                            don’t want to compromise the operation. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Jim
                                (Schlesinger)</persName> what do you think? What do you consider is
                            the chance they will jump us?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The last time,
                            the pilots of the Libyan planes didn’t get the [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] and as a result they were
                            relieved and sent home [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] I think the chances are high that there are
                            standing orders to shoot the next one down.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: That is all the more
                            reason not to give them much notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It’s also a reason we
                            should make a record of notification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Another factor is
                            that they’ve been confusing us with the Israelis. There is less chance
                            that will happen if we tell them in advance that we’re coming
                            through.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>) What do you recommend?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Now you’re asking
                            me for a policy judgment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s not unknown
                            for you to make one.</p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_24"/>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Why can’t we have
                            our cake and eat it, too, by giving them just one hour notice?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Where is the
                            Deputy Secretary of Defense?</p>
                        <p>Adm. Murphy: He’s taking care of some stockpile matters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s the matter
                            with his sense of priorities?</p>
                        <p>Adm. Murphy: He’s making a statement on stockpiles. But I can say that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> favors a warning to
                            the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So there are two
                            issues involved here, (a) to warn the Libyans for the record and (b) to
                            protect our aircraft. The two are contradictory. In the first instance,
                            if we notify them we are coming and they know the aircraft are not
                            Israeli planes, they may not attack; but if they are committed to attack
                            anyway, the warning will make their attack more effective. How much
                            notice will the Libyans have from the time the planes first enter their
                            radar scopes?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Not a lot. Frankly,
                            I don’t know how they can confuse our planes with the Israelis. [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The Libyans don’t
                            know that. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] They have
                            convinced themselves the Israelis are going to attack them and that we
                            are helping the Israelis. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName>: Even if we do warn
                            the Libyans, will they believe us?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s a different
                            question. If we give them two hours notice, won’t it take them at least
                            an hour to get organized and get their planes into the air?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Why tell them when
                            we’re coming? We can just say we expect to be passing through
                            international air space at some indefinite time, adding that we are
                            making no threat to their air space. We can pass that word to them with
                            a minimum amount of warning time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To achieve the
                            objective of having them hold back their fighters on realizing that the
                            planes are ours rather than the Israelis, we would have to give them
                            time to do something after receiving our notice.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: But they may already
                            have made the decision to attack, anyway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then there is
                            nothing we can do, except make the record.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: You could make a
                            strong case that you had warned them. They are not exactly imbued with
                            integrity, but we could have our cake and eat it by warning them at the
                            last minute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Unless there is a
                            possibility they may turn it off. If we think they will, we have to give
                            them time to do so. On the other <pb n="25" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_25"
                            />hand, if we are convinced they won’t, we should give them as little
                            time as possible. Well, we’ll let you know the decision in a couple of
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I think it is
                            important to let them know that the planes are U.S. and not Israeli.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Then we’ll have to
                            tell them each time we fly past Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Maybe so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What are we
                            collecting there, anyway?</p>

                            important. It’s the threat to the principle of operating freely over
                            international waters that bothers us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s the only
                            reason the White House is interested.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: We could do without
                            the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] but we’re
                            concerned about the principle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eagleburger: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                            said he wanted to discuss this morning what we should do as a next step.
                            He thought it was important to consider what we do next if there is an
                            attack by Libyan planes on our aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we get
                            together a joint paper on what we should do if something happens? Let’s
                            get a little group together, including State, Defense, <gloss

                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff, to consider next steps. I have
                            a suspicion we are building a Wagnerian drama here.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Probably nothing at
                            all will happen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The basic question
                            is whether we are going to let Libya turn off U.S. flights 75 miles off
                            the coast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>: No, we’re
                            not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: The answer to that is
                            no, but we think the timing is wrong to fly another flight. If we veto
                            the Arab resolution in the United Nations and then fly an [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] flight past
                            Libya later the same day, it will look like a deliberate
                            provocation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is there ever
                            going to be a right time for such flights?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Probably not. We have
                            a big gas deal with Algeria that is close to signing. They could turn
                            that off if we get into a fight with Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Has State ever, at
                            any time in the last four weeks, considered the timing satisfactory for
                            another flight?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: No, you’re quite
                            right. There’s never a good time, but we think this is a particularly
                            bad one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Has State ever
                            approved flying this flight?</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_26"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: We have approved the
                            principle of resuming the flights, but not the timing. If there is a
                            veto in the U.N. and a flight the same day it will even look as though
                            we are defying the U.N. Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When I brought
                            this issue up four weeks ago the bureaucracy showed great ingenuity in
                            finding objections to the resumption of the flights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: There is a gas
                            shortage east of the Mississippi. We need that contract with Algeria
                            badly and it will be a big problem if the deal falls through. The timing
                            is never right for this kind of flight; I’ll agree with that 100%.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Libyans made a
                            pass at a U.S. plane five weeks ago. For five weeks this government has
                            sat on its hands and done nothing. We have been afraid to fly past a
                            country of two million people. We are debating with ourselves,
                            constructing devious arguments. Next we’ll discover that no one has
                            consulted the Greeks and we’ll start worrying about them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It’s not true that we
                            have done nothing. We have made protests to the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is something
                            wrong with our policy process here. We are afraid to fly 75 miles
                            offshore from a two-bit country and now you tell us that Algerian gas
                            deals are threatened by our flying over international waters. How can
                            the Algerians possibly consider our flights a threat to them?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>: If the gas deal is all
                            that fragile, they’ll find some other excuse for breaking it off.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> arrived at this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: We should keep it
                            simple, just tell them the minimum we have to as late as possible before
                            the flight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, the
                            President will make the decision. I don’t want any leaks about this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: About what?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: About these
                            discussions and the views of the various agencies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: There won’t be any
                            leaks, and when the decision is made you can be sure we’ll support
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The decision to
                            fly the flight has already been made, but I will bring your reservation
                            about the timing to the President’s attention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Actually, we covered
                            the timing problem in our previous comments. The only new item is the
                            pending U.N. Security Council vote.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>(TS) In accordance with the discussion at the <gloss target="#t_WSAG_1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> on 16 April, we have examined alternatives in response
                            to—“what do we do or say if the Libyans attack our aircraft on the [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Mission of 17
                            April 1973?”</p>
                        <p>(TS) In considering our actions we have again given weight to the two
                            factors set forth in the letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> of 5 April 1973:</p>
                        <p>(a) Our aircraft will be proceeding in international air space. The
                            Libyan Government establishment of a restricted area within 100 nautical
                            miles of Tripoli is not recognized by the U.S. Government, and we have
                            lodged formal protest with the Libyan Government concerning their
                            unilateral and illegal declaration of air space control. The Libyan <pb
                                n="28" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_28"/>attack on our aircraft was
                            unprovoked and illegal and, if not met by appropriate response from the
                            U.S. Government, it would reinforce the Libyan claim.</p>
                        <p>(b) It is our objective to maintain diplomatic relations with the Libyan
                            Government, both to maintain contact with this government and to
                            represent the some 3,000 citizens in this country and our very
                            substantial (in excess of $1 billion) investments in Libya.</p>
                        <p>(TS) Outlined below are two non-military options available to us if our
                            aircraft are attacked:</p>
                        <p>(a) Option 1. Diplomatic protest only. We could make our position clear
                            again that we do not recognize the Libyan claim and regard their attack
                            upon our aircraft as an illegal and unwarranted act that will certainly
                            affect relationships between our countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pro:</hi> Presents minimum potential for open conflict,
                            break in diplomatic relations or actions against U.S. citizens or
                            property.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> We have delivered protests before on the
                            Libyan claims on air space. A diplomatic protest would be viewed as a
                            weak and ineffective response.</p>
                        <p>(b) Option 2. We could threaten, or act, to withhold sales of military
                            equipment to the Libyan Government; specifically this would be the
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and commercial pipeline of
                            spares for the F–5s and C–130s of the Libyan Air Force; a contract
                            maintenance team furnished by Lockheed for the C–130s; and a recent
                            request to purchase additional C–130s.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pro:</hi> The Libyan Government needs our support for
                            U.S. military equipment. Its loss could certainly limit their
                            utilization of this equipment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> (1) Our leverage with respect to military
                            equipment is limited. It is possible that the support required by the
                            Libyan Government could be obtained from other sources. (2) Denial of
                            U.S. military equipment (spares) would increase prospects for Soviet
                            military sales and influence in Libya.</p>
                        <p>(TS) The following actions are military oriented and in certain cases
                            could and/or would be done in concert with the two foregoing nonmilitary
                            options. We should reschedule additional missions with escort into
                            HLR–22 at a rate initially of approximately one per day. Other actions
                            which might be taken concurrently, not necessarily arranged in
                            recommended priority of adoption, are:</p>
                        <p>a. Expand present authorities to include hot pursuit into Libyan
                            airspace.</p>
                        <p>b. Escort aircraft on future [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] missions be authorized to engage/destroy Libyan
                            fighter aircraft upon <pb n="29" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_29"
                            />detection/intercept regardless of whether or not hostile intent has
                            been established.</p>
                        <p>c. Commence military air operations from a U.S. CVA inside of HLR–22, but
                            outside 12 mile limit. Engage/destroy any Libyan fighter aircraft which
                            approach U.S. aircraft or ships.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pro:</hi> The advantage to the above actions would be
                            to demonstrate our determination to exercise our right to operate in

                            reprisal action against those interfering with our rights by acts of
                            force.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons</hi>:</p>
                        <p>a. There would be strong and violent reaction throughout the Arab world,
                            and almost certainly reprisals against U.S. oil and other commercial
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>b. There would be a severe hazard to the lives of U.S. nationals living
                            in Libya. There might be a severe danger in other Arab countries due to
                            street mobs and arranged demonstrations or overt attacks against U.S.
                            personnel and properties.</p>
                        <p>c. Sympathy for the Libyan “cause” in the world councils and in the world
                            press would be enhanced, and corresponding damage to American
                            prestige.</p>
                        <p>d. Relations with our allies in western Europe, who are highly dependent
                            upon Libyan oil, would be gravely strained, and we would find some of
                            them in strong opposition to the United States both within and without

                        <p>(TS) Additionally, we are exploring Libyan flag shipping and aircraft
                            assets operating outside Libya which might be susceptible to reprisal
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>(S) In the event a serious incident results from the [<hi rend="italic"

                            attacks.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is well entrenched in
                            Libya, and no successor is in sight. His headstrong pursuit of the Arab
                            cause puts him in direct conflict with U.S. interests in much of the
                            Middle East. Rivalries among Arab leaders may thwart some of his
                            aspirations to lead the “Arab Nation.” [<hi rend="italic">8 lines not

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assessment</p>
                        <p>Significant elements in the <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> problem are:</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is firmly in charge in
                            Libya and there is no successor in sight. He dominates the Revolutionary
                            Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>) which makes all
                            important decisions. The army is his power base and he uses the
                            trappings of various political organizations—such as the Arab Socialist
                            Union—to conceal his direct rule and defuse dissent.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s regime is not, however,
                            popular. There is grumbling at home, and the march toward merger with
                            Egypt has been resented <pb n="31" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_31"/>by the
                            Libyan people. But the population is by no means mutinous. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> makes the most of his
                            leadership qualities and may, if pressed, back off the merger issue.</p>
                        <p>—One cannot ignore the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> may eventually be overthrown by the military,
                            particularly if pressure builds up over his tendency to one-man rule or
                            plans for merger with Egypt. Differences no doubt exist within the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> thus far has managed them
                            shrewdly. He now seems capable of asserting even greater personal rule
                            at the expense of a collegiate decision by the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss>. But, if <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            could no longer control the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> or
                            should another group of military officers seize power, a popular
                            reaction against his ouster would be unlikely—especially if the new
                            leadership immediately declared <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s merger plans null and void.</p>
                        <p>—The American oil companies are still operating their concessions.
                            Although <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has advocated
                            the use of oil money to strike at Israel and its supporters, he has thus
                            far not convinced his neighbors, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>, to pursue such an all-out plan. And Libya’s
                            need for American oil technology has delayed <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> in the unilateral resort to oil as a weapon. The
                            long-term prospects of the American oil producing companies in Libya are
                            not good, but they still contribute 300 million dollars per year to our
                            balance of payments. The power to nationalize them remains a credible
                            threat in <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s hands.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, in recent months,
                            frustrated in his efforts to get the fedayeen to carry out a successful
                            national liberation struggle within Israel, has turned to advocacy of
                            acts of terrorism outside of Palestine and to the subversion of regimes
                            which do not agree with him. This has brought him into direct conflict
                            with American interests.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> can invoke and manipulate
                            ideas with strong emotional appeal to most Arabs. In any direct
                            confrontation with the U.S., <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> could probably mobilize considerable sympathy
                            among the Arabs, including those in the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> remains relatively
                            insensitive to outside economic and political pressures.</p>
                        <p>—The Arab world remains divided, with many of its leaders—<persName

                        <p>Our relations with Libya continue to be severely strained on a variety of
                            issues. In a discussion with Bureau representatives on May 8 it was
                            agreed that a prudent policy was called for on our side lest we play
                            into <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s hands by giving
                            him a pretext for confrontations with us and for a break in diplomatic
                            relations which we still believe it is in our interest to preserve at
                            least until we see the nature of the Libyan-Egyptian union scheduled for
                            September 1. If you agree with this general approach, we shall take the
                            actions indicated in the attachment to this memorandum on various policy
                            problems that have recently arisen.</p>

                        <p>After a sudden tightening of the regulation that all passports presented
                            for Libyan visas must be in Arabic, the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> has now restored the five original categories of
                            exemptions from this requirement. Diplomats and dependents of visa
                            applicants are not included among the exemptions. Because we do not know
                            how the policy will work in practice, we believe we should be prepared
                            to authorize one of our posts on a trial basis to notarize Arabic
                            translations of the basic data in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            passports for Americans desiring to enter Libya; simultaneously, we
                            would inform other interested governments of our action. We would not
                                <pb n="34" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_34"/>formally notify the Libyans
                            until we found out whether they were admitting Americans possessing this
                            new documentation. If this pilot procedure worked, we would require that
                            Libyans obtain the same translation-authentication service from their
                            government in order to obtain American visas. AF would determine when
                            the pilot procedure should be attempted, based on the degree to which in
                            practice the newly declared exemptions meet the needs of both the
                            official and private community.</p>

                        <p>Lockheed wishes to renew for two years (with an option for a third year)
                            an expired maintenance and training contract it had with the Libyans for
                            the eight C–130’s Libya bought in 1969. The contract is worth about
                            $4,000,000 to the company. We appreciate the company’s need for funds,
                            and we perceive some advantages in maintaining a limited contact with
                            the Libyan Air Force. However, a two year contract might involve the
                            transfer after September 1 of American military technology to a third
                            party (the planned Libyan-Egyptian state) not initially authorized to
                            receive it. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David

                            the contract provided it contains a clause permitting its suspension
                            when and if Libya merges with Egypt. This would permit the Department to
                            reassess the situation at that time.</p>

                        <p>We reviewed the question of whether we should retaliate against the

                            action in declaring our Political Officer, Charles Marthinsen, <gloss
                                target="#t_Png_1">PNG</gloss>. We agreed that it would not be
                            advisable to do so. Retaliation would only prolong a confrontation we
                            would rather leave behind us and could lead the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> to require that we reduce our
                            Embassy staff below its already austere level (15 now reduced to 13). In
                            reaching this conclusion we had in mind that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> may be seeking to goad the <gloss

                            projected union with Egypt. Because of our remaining interests in Libya
                            we do not believe we should respond to these provocations.</p>

                            reconnaissance flights off Libya in May. Following the March 21
                            confrontation between one of <pb n="35" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_35"/>our

                            evaluation of the usefulness of these flights in terms of our
                            intelligence requirements. I have informed the Chairman of the Committee
                            concerned with these flights that we cannot concur in future flights,
                            including those scheduled for May, until we have received and reviewed a
                            report on their intelligence justification. I believe this stance is
                            consistent with the desirability of avoiding unnecessary confrontations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>, particularly since we
                            have clearly demonstrated by flights subsequent to March 21 that we will

                        <p>I have taken under advisement a suggestion by <persName

                            ascertain whether there is any way in which our differences could either
                            be eased or set aside. I am not certain yet that such a contact would be
                            productive, even if we could arrange it through the assistance of a
                            friendly Arab state, such as Tunisia. However, I have asked AF to
                            continue to re-examine the pros and cons, to endeavor to identify an
                            individual whose acceptability to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> might enhance the prospects for any such

                            inroads. Mobutu would also be asked to generate an

                            advance our aims, additional support can be considered. State believes
                            that any financial support for this more limited effort should be not

                            demonstrated by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s current
                            efforts to pressure African states to support Libyan policies which are

                            attain these objectives, and suggesting the funneling of funds through
                            him to influence other African states toward these objectives. Mobutu
                            has been discreet in the past and we forsee no security risks in this

                            Libya</p>
                        <p>We have up to now maintained our policy of not acceding to Libyan demands
                            that our passports contain official translations of their basic
                            information into Arabic. We have been concerned by the travel document
                            precedent which acceptance of the Libyan demand could set. We have also
                            been unwilling to appear to yield to Libyan pressures.</p>
                        <p>In recent weeks, <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> businessmen and their
                            families have been generally admitted into the country without major
                            problems, although their passports have not been in Arabic. However, the
                            Libyan Government will not allow any <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Government employees to enter Libya because of the passport language
                            requirement. If any of our personnel leave the country presumably they
                            will not be readmitted. Other diplomatic personnel—British, Swiss,
                            German and Venezuelan—have experienced the same problem on attempting to
                            enter or re-enter Libya. Thus, for all practical purposes we cannot
                            transfer our Embassy personnel unless we are prepared to accept a
                            further erosion of the already-reduced mission staff.</p>
                        <p>Despite the problems posed for our mission and the potential problem for
                            our business community and dependents, we have decided to continue to
                            oppose Libyan demands on passport issue, even though reports indicate
                            that European governments (most recently the British and Italian,
                            following the French) are prepared to insert Arabic into their passports
                            in certain instances. In holding out against the Libyans we risk greater
                            problems for our American citizens, private and official, but we think
                            the issue is an important one and that we <pb n="41" facs="0068"
                                xml:id="pg_41"/>should not change our stance at this time. If and
                            when it is clear that the Libyans will accept simple rubber stamps in
                            Arabic in passports and not demand that Arabic appear as one of the
                            printed languages we must, of course, reexamine our position in the
                            light of all factors. Another reason for not changing our position now
                            is that we also believe Libya will admit to its territory foreigners,
                            including Americans, it is willing to receive or whom it needs, e.g.,
                            petroleum engineers. On the other hand, it will exclude—or expel—those
                            it does not want regardless of their passports.</p>
                        <p>We expect this problem with Libya will remain at least until September 1
                            when Libya is scheduled to merge with Egypt. Even though that merger may
                            be limited in scope, it may permit issuance of a single visa for both
                            the Libyan and Egyptian regions. If it does, our problem will have been
                            solved and we will not have handed Libya a victory it obviously is
                            seeking. However, we must expect to receive pressure between now and
                            then from the American business community concerned for its operations
                            in Libya. We are therefore continuing to follow the situation closely
                            and have indicated that we are prepared to listen to any specific cases
                            of hardship for our citizens resulting from our refusal to yield on the
                            language problem.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this paper is to review <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            relations with Libya, the prospects for their improvement, and the
                            options available to the United States to protect its interests in that
                            country and in the region.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations with Libya have been
                            severely strained since the overthrow of the Libyan Monarchy on
                            September 1, 1969. Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>) Chairman <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> and the rest of the Libyan leadership identify
                            the United States with Israel, Libya’s paramount foreign enemy. He also
                            seems to genuinely fear an Israeli attack on Libya with <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> assistance. Our relations with Libya are
                            currently at a low ebb as a result of Libya’s militant rejection of a
                            peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli problem, the Libyan regime’s
                            attempt to shoot down an American reconnaissance plane on March 21, the
                            nationalization on June 11 of an American oil company (Bunker Hunt), and
                            continuing high-level Libyan denunciations of American “arrogance” and
                            “imperialism” in the Arab world and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concern with Libya stems basically
                            from the importance of Libyan oil, primarily to Western Europe, the size
                            of the American investment in the Libyan oil industry, and the
                            contribution which that investment makes to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> balance of payments, the continued presence in Libya of
                            approximately 2,800 American citizens and the political disruptive
                            capability of Libya in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere because of
                            its vast financial reserves. Our freedom to take actions counter to the
                            Libyan regime are inhibited by Europe’s need for Libyan oil and the
                            large remaining private <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> stake in the
                            Libyan oil industry. The effectiveness of actions by us against Libya
                            would be limited also by European moves to protect and pursue their own
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Libya’s geographical position in the central and eastern Mediterranean
                            endow it with a strategic significance in the event of an outbreak of
                            hostilities in the Middle East that might require the deployment of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military resources in the
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Although some of the problems indicated above might be attenuated in the
                            event of some form of merger between Libya and Egypt on September 1,
                            this is by no means certain, given Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"

                        <p>The Libyan regime which came to power in September 1969 is shaped by the
                            views of <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Mu’ammar Qadhafi</persName>, which are generally
                            shared by other Libyan <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members and
                            policy makers. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was born
                            in a tent in 1941 and brought up in desert surroundings. From this
                            background he developed a strict puritanical morality, personal
                            aceticism, plus conservative Islamic religious fervor which places the
                            highest value on Arab and Islamic historical accomplishments and
                            traditions. This was combined in his formative years with a strong sense
                            of Arab and Islamic humiliation resulting from foreign, chiefly western,
                            influence in Libya and the Arab world. The establishment of Israel and
                            the continued existence of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and UK
                            military bases in Libya and elsewhere were seen by <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> as symbols of that humiliation.
                            Nasser’s efforts to unite other Arab states as a necessary step towards
                            asserting Arab power and overthrowing the foreign-sponsored state of
                            Israel inevitably made the Egyptian leader <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s hero and model. This outlook was reinforced by
                            the shock of the 1967 war, the loss of more Arab territories to Israel,
                            the lack of involvement by Libya then in the Arab cause, and the
                            widespread corruption in Libya during the last years of the
                            Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, after seizing power in 1969, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> immediately and successfully brought about
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and UK withdrawal from Libyan
                            bases. Since then he has vigorously pursued longer-term objectives of
                            ridding Libya and the Arab Middle East of other forms of foreign
                            influence. His objectives include the elimination of foreign oil
                            concessions and even of non-Arabs from Libya; ridding the Arab world of
                            foreign bases and alliances; the overthrow of Arab governments, such as
                            Morocco and <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>, which
                            countenance foreign influence; promoting international recognition of
                            Arabic; and supporting Muslim co-religionists around the world with
                            money and arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> sees his role as the
                            successor of Nasser to redeem and unite the Arabs, under his own
                            leadership if possible. He regards the planned Libyan merger with Egypt
                            this year as the necessary first step.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> seems prepared to
                            sacrifice a measure of Libyan independence to achieve these goals, while
                            retaining control over certain key areas, such as Libyan finances.
                            Libya’s weak national tradition may facilitate his task, although
                            Libyans generally are suspicious of foreigners, including Egyptians, and
                            they are resentful of any foreign effort to remind them of their
                            cultural inferiority or to detach them from their newly acquired
                            wealth.</p>
                        <p>Libya’s primary objective under <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s leadership has been the mobilization of the
                            Arabs to bring about the elimination of Israel as an independent Jewish
                            state and the restoration of their homeland to the Palestinian Arabs. He
                            judges the leadership of his brother Arabs, as he <pb n="45" facs="0072"
                                xml:id="pg_45"/>does that of the United States, chiefly in terms of
                            their attitude toward Israel. Inasmuch as the United States is seen as
                            the chief guarantor of Israel’s existence, normal <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan government relations in any field
                            becomes virtually impossible, including technical cooperation.
                            Indicative of his depth of feeling regarding Arab rights and past Arab
                            humiliations, are <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            pronouncements that the United States and United Kingdom and their oil
                            companies must be punished for their exploitation of the Arab world.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> INTERESTS AND
                            OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Interests</p>
                        <p>The principal <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economic interest in
                            Libya is the American-dominated oil industry which represents about 80
                            percent of Libya’s production of 2.3 million barrels daily. The American
                            investment in the industry has a net book value in excess of one billion
                            dollars and a market value of well over four billion. The annual
                            repatriated profits of the eleven American companies producing oil in
                            Libya in recent years have averaged between $400–500 million, a
                            significant positive element in the deteriorating American balance of
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>Libya has also become an important source of low-sulphur crude oil for
                            Western Europe, particularly Germany, Italy and France whose suppliers
                            are principally the American producers in Libya. Libyan oil exports to
                            the United States are relatively modest. However, they could become more
                            important because of the low-sulphur quality of Libyan crude and our
                            pollution regulations.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in terms of oil the United States is deeply interested in Libya
                            because of the size and earnings of the American petroleum investment in
                            that country, the volume of Libya’s production during a period of
                            world-wide shortages, the quality of the oil, and the dependence of
                            Western Europe on Libya as a nearby source of energy. In addition to
                            these economic-commercial interests, the United States is also concerned
                            with the physical security of some 2,800 Americans resident in Libya,
                            most of whom are associated with the oil industry.</p>
                        <p>Libya’s substantial earnings from the industry—about $2 billion
                            annually—help to finance an ambitious economic development program. This
                            program provides a significant market for American exports of equipment,
                            technology and managerial skills. Libya could become a much larger
                            market for the United States if the political relations between the two
                            countries were to improve.</p>
                        <p>The United States has an interest in the political stability and peace of
                            the Middle East and Africa. Libya’s vast financial resources endow it
                            with the capability of disruptive political and military activities in
                            those areas.</p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="0073" xml:id="pg_46"/>
                        <p>Finally, because of its lengthy coastline and position athwart the
                            central and eastern Mediterranean, Libya could have a strategic
                            significance to the United States in the event of hostilities in the
                            area. Because of its geography, Libyan territory could be used to
                            interdict <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> air and sea traffic in the
                            region.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">2.</hi> Objectives</p>

                        <p>The primary <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> political objective is to
                            counter Libya’s disruptive political activism in the Middle East, Africa
                            and in the Mediterranean and elsewhere to encourage any possible
                            constructive role it could play given its financial resources.</p>
                        <p>(1) With respect to the Middle East, Libya pursues an extremist policy.
                            Libya opposes the existence of Israel, argues for its liquidation by
                            military means, and seeks to counter a negotiated settlement in any
                            form. Its policy has been one of strong support of the Palestinian
                            guerrillas and terrorists by arms, money and training. No solution to
                            the Arab-Israeli problem based on <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council resolution 242 would be acceptable to Libya under
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s leadership.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Libya supports subversion or insurgency</hi>
                            against Morocco, <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>,
                            Ethiopia, Chad, the Philippines, Northern Ireland and possibly Lebanon
                            and Sudan. Its primary motivation in each case is to undermine regimes
                            which in its view are not sufficiently militant on the Arab-Israeli
                            issue, are tolerant of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> or Soviet
                            influence, or are engaged in suppressing armed Palestinian or Muslim
                            movements within their territories.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in the
                                Mediterranean have recently clashed with Libya</hi> following
                            Libya’s declaration of a “restricted area” within a 100-mile radius of
                            Tripoli International Airport. Libya asserts the right to control the
                            entrance of aircraft or ships within this restricted area—a right which
                            the United States disputes. On 21 March Libyan fighter aircraft fired at
                            an unarmed <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> C–130 reconnaissance
                            plane flying within the restricted zone. On subsequent flights when a
                            similar <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> aircraft flew in
                            international airspace within the 100-mile zone, Libyan fighters limited
                            their patrol to within the 12 nautical mile sea frontier and did not
                            attack the <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> aircraft. Libya has,
                            however, publicly and repeatedly denounced such reconnaissance flights
                            as provocative incursions of Libyan airspace and territorial waters. The
                            United States has denied any hostile intentions toward Libya, but our
                            attempts to engage Libyan authorities in a meaningful dialogue on the
                            issue of airspace have been fruitless. Complicating the situation is
                            Libyan fear of attack by Israel supported by <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> intelligence or armed forces in the Mediterranean, as
                            evidenced by the laying of minefields off Tripoli harbor in June.</p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_47"/>
                        <p>Libya plans to establish a Libyan Flight Information Region (FIR) over
                            the Mediterranean adjacent to Libya, and may eventually seek to
                            interfere with similar reconnaissance flights or other flights by
                            exercising a right to control and restrict aircraft movements within
                            this region. Libyan attempts to enforce unilateral extensions of control
                            over international waters and air space, particularly in the confined
                            area between Libya and the southern coast of Crete, could possibly pose
                            recurring problems for planned <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>

                        <p>A major <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> objective, therefore, is to
                            prevent Libya from unilaterally restricting <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            transferred to Egypt in the event of a new war would provide Egypt with

                            oil concessions was also set off in part by the fear of Persian Gulf
                            countries of appearing too accommodating towards the oil companies in

                        <p>The Libyan Government generally enjoys the passive support of the dour,
                            inward-looking Libyan population which has had no meaningful experience
                            with participation in self-government. With the exception of the
                            demonstrations of June 1967 and February 1973, Libyans have shown little
                            inclination for risk-taking political activism. (The Libyan populace
                            played no significant role in the military coup of September 1969, which
                            was engineered entirely by a small group of army officers.) The regime’s
                            policies of reducing foreign influence, closing bases, taking over
                            foreign companies, and reducing foreign presence have been generally
                            popular. Its militant stance towards Israel finds popular acceptance as
                            long as it entails no self-sacrifice or personal threat to individuals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s personal honesty,
                            undoubted sincerity and incorruptibility, have won support for his
                            regime. Rising Libyan oil revenues have been distributed to broad social
                            groups through increases in wages, greater benefits for the army, and
                            ambitious public works projects such as housing.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the regime is not without its opponents. While there has
                            been no real challenge to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                            >Qadhafi</persName>’s leadership, the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss> and “Free” officers who came to power with <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, and elements of the broader
                            Libyan population have been divided over the planned merger with Egypt.
                            The opposition to union has been serious, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s determination in this matter
                            could prove to be a critical test of his leadership and to the continued
                            cohesion of the ruling military collegium. A military coup cannot be
                            ruled out, but there is no conclusive evidence of any conspiracies. Nor
                            is there any assurance that a successor military regime would adopt a
                            significantly less hostile attitude toward the United States.</p>
                        <p>Libyan news dispatches have mentioned the Ba’ath Party and “communist”
                            elements as engaging the anti-regime activities. Old regime exiles have
                            also attempted abortive actions against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>. None of these groups appears capable of

                        <p>Potentially, the most significant source of opposition to the regime
                            could stem from Libya’s relations with Egypt. The influx of as many as
                            200,000 Egyptians in Libya since 1969 has already led to numerous
                                inci<pb n="53" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_53"/>dents and violence
                            between the two nationalities. Should the influx of Egyptians increase
                            to the point where many Libyans felt their jobs or social structure
                            threatened, or should the planned merger with Egypt go forward in areas
                            which appeared to threaten vital interests of important groups—such as
                            the Army—a reaction could result which would pose a threat to the
                            regime. Opposition to political integration with Egypt is particularly
                            strong in Cyrenaica, which has a long history of dislike of Egyptians
                            and of governments based in Tripoli.</p>

                        <p>Whatever the form that the “union” initially takes, we believe both
                            countries will proceed at the outset in their own way as before, with
                            neither party able to dominate the other and with continued friction
                            between them. Initially, the chief effect may be in combining Egyptian
                            and Libyan diplomatic missions and the reduction of Embassies in Tripoli
                            to some lower status.</p>
                        <p>To the extent a union is a strong one, it will be dominated by Egypt.
                            Bolstered economically with Libyan oil wealth, Egypt would probably
                            continue to pursue its quest for a favorable political solution to the
                            Arab-Israeli dispute. Being in a stronger economic position, Egypt might
                            also be tempted to pursue more activist policies in inter-Arab affairs,
                            but we do not foresee <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            adopting the extremist Libyan approach to international politics.</p>
                        <p>Unless there were to be a significant rise in Arab-Israeli tensions, we
                            would expect that Egyptian moderation might temper Libyan extremism in
                            dealings with American and other foreign oil companies. At the same
                            time, we and the companies would be dealing with a relatively
                            cosmopolitan government in Cairo rather than trying to cope with a
                            head-strong, inexperienced and xenophobic junta in Tripoli. Having
                            acquired substantial oil resources, Egypt could be expected to play a
                            more active role in international oil affairs.</p>
                        <p>A merger with Egypt might also attenuate some of the more bizarre
                            policies espoused by the Libyans, such as the demand for the translation
                            of foreign passports into Arabic.</p>

                            out a merger with Egypt. The impunity with which he found he was able to
                            move F–5s to Pakistan in 1971, contrary to written agreements with the
                            United States, was followed in 1973 by the deployment of Mirages and
                            heavy artillery to Egypt, contrary to written agreement with France and
                            Italy. Agreements with oil companies in 1970 and 1971 which were to last
                            five years were followed in 1973 by even more extreme demands against

                            nationals (including their diplomats) into Libya.</p>
                        <p>At times when <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has met firm
                            resistance—in oil negotiations or initially on the issue of recognizing
                            only passports which include Arabic, he has backed down or not carried
                            through on his threats, only to raise the issue again or resume the
                            pressure from a slightly different angle. He has been willing to
                            improvise, but has adhered to his goals with remarkable tenacity.</p>
                        <p>In view of his successes thus far, it is reasonable to assume <persName

                            available to fill gaps until Libyan technicians can be trained.</p>
                        <p>As a specific sign of displeasure over the Libyan nationalization of

                        <p>Libya apparently genuinely fears that the United States and United
                            Kingdom may block Libyan funds in case of nationalization, just as
                            Egyptian funds in London were frozen after the Suez Canal
                            nationalization. If the United States wished to do so, it could possibly
                            block Libyan funds, perhaps by invoking the Trading with the Enemy Act.
                            (The applicability of this legislation to a nationalization case is not
                            certain.) The effect of such action on Libya would be relatively slight,
                            since most of Libya’s $2.8 billion in reserves is held in Europe. Libya
                            might retaliate against blockage of its funds by nationalizing all or
                            several of the remaining <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil
                            companies and by breaking diplomatic relations. Before taking such a
                            drastic step, the United States would wish to consider its
                            precedent-setting effects on international monetary transactions.</p>

                        <p>Independent oil companies in Libya without major alternate sources of
                            production in the Middle East are most vulnerable to Libyan threat to
                            expropriation. To bolster the smaller companies in their negotiations,
                            we expressed in 1971 a lack of intent to prosecute the companies at that
                            time under the anti-trust laws despite a Sharing Agreement concluded by
                            the oil companies operating in Libya. Under this agreement, if a company
                            is nationalized or has its oil production reduced by the Libyan
                            government as a pressure tactic against it in the course of oil
                            negotiations, the other companies will give that company crude oil at or
                            slightly above cost from their own production, either from their own
                            production in Libya or from crude production in the Persian Gulf. This
                            agreement expires at the end of 1973 with respect to reductions imposed
                            by the Libyan Government; it expires at the end of 1974 with respect to
                            total nationalization or a total shutdown of a company’s Libyan
                            production. (Bunker Hunt, nationalized in June 1973, will therefore
                            benefit under this agreement until the end of 1974.)</p>
                        <p>To bolster the companies’ negotiating position with Libya, we might urge
                            them to extend the Sharing Agreement for a longer period of time, and
                            indicate our continued intention not to prosecute under the anti-trust
                            laws as long as implementation of the agreement was required to help
                            those companies hurt during negotiations with Libya.</p>

                            endlessly. Our leverage in regard to further arms sales to Libya now is,
                            therefore, essentially negative—disapproval would show opposition to
                            Libyan policies and might risk Libyan retaliation of some kind, but
                            approval of arms sales is not likely to gain us any political

                        <p>Potentially, the most sensitive leverage we have against Libya is our

                            and Lockheed. Deliveries are scheduled to begin this fall and Lockheed
                            is expected to submit applications for export licenses late this
                            summer.</p>
                        <p>When the contract was signed in the spring of 1972 we informed the Libyan

                            Government would only decide on the licenses in the light of all the
                            existing circumstances at the time Lockheed applied for them. We have
                            since told Lockheed that it is unlikely the applications will be

                        <p>Lockheed’s contract with Libya called for advance payments totalling more
                            than $30 million; we know that payments totalling about $28.5 million
                            have been made. If we do not approve the licenses, Lockheed will return
                            Libya’s deposit without interest if it is able to sell the aircraft to
                            another customer within one year, minus any amount Lockheed receives

                        <p>In June 1969 the United States concluded a sales agreement with the
                            former Libyan regime covering eight F–5s. (Ten other F–5s were delivered
                            from the United States to Libya under an earlier contract, of which
                            eight are still flying.) No payments were made by the old or the new
                            regime on the 1969 order and none was requested by the United States.
                            From time to time, the Libyans, most recently during the <gloss

                            and relations between the United States and Libya have obviously changed
                            in the four years since the sales contract was signed. It is doubtful
                            that the Libyans any longer expect delivery of the planes (their fighter
                            aircraft needs would appear to have been abundantly met by the purchase

                            Most of these have been from Italy, including heavy artillery,

                        <p>The United States sells Libya spare parts for aircraft we have previously
                            sold. This includes spares for F–5s, sold through Foreign Military Sales
                            arrangements, and spares for C–130s which are sold by Lockheed with
                            licenses from the Office of Munitions Control. Libya has also used Greek
                            aircraft repair facilities. Libyan C–130s have made periodic trips to
                            Greece to deliver, and later pick up, repairable components for F–5
                            aircraft and J–85 engines. Libya may also be getting F–5 spares from
                            Greece. An embargo on the acquisition of such spares, both from the
                            United States and third countries, probably would deny Libya the use of
                            these F–5 and C–130 aircraft after a period of time. The F–5s are
                            important to Libya for training pilots for the more advanced French

                            supplies in support of governments friendly to Libya, such as Uganda, or
                            insurgents. They are also a significant logistic link between Libya and
                            Egypt and symbols of Libya’s activism abroad.</p>

                            would not be felt immediately since Libya is believed to have stockpiled
                            spares and to be searching for alternate sources of spares outside the

                                Nationals</hi></p>
                        <p>One of the most difficult problems in our relations with Libya stems from
                            Libya’s insistence that it will only recognize passports which contain
                            an official translation of passport information into Arabic. Although
                            some persons have been exempted, this requirement has been used to
                            exclude most diplomats, tourists, and others Libyan authorities deem
                            unnecessary to admit. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> employees,
                            diplomats accredited and resident in Tripoli, and diplomatic couriers
                            have been denied entry on grounds their passports were not in Arabic,
                            even when they possessed valid Libyan visas. American Embassy personnel
                            cannot leave Libya since replacement personnel cannot be sent. Libyan
                            authorities can exclude at will oil company dependents as well as school
                            teachers in the oil company school and medical personnel in the oil
                            company clinic. Such a change would undermine oil company morale and
                            impair the effectiveness of their operations.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all governments, including the French, British, Italian, German
                            and Spanish, have decided to insert an Arabic rubber stamp into the
                            passports of their nationals and thereby, hopefully, satisfy the Libyan
                            demand. However, there is no evidence to date whether Libya will be
                            satisfied with the rubber stamp procedure; certain of its officials have
                            indicated that this procedure will be acceptable only temporarily and
                            that the Libyan Government will still require that passports be printed
                            in Arabic.</p>
                        <p>The United States has not accepted the Libyan passport requirement,
                            contending that each government has the right to decide for itself the
                            nature of the travel documentation for its nationals. We are also
                            concerned over the precedent that would be set by agreeing to the Libyan
                            demand. (The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position has been to
                            adhere to the recommendation of a United Nations Commission in 1963 that
                            governments issue <pb n="60" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_60"/>their passports
                            in their own national language and either in French or English.) Also,
                            the printing of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> passports in Arabic
                            would pose serious administrative and budgetary problems for the United
                            States. Finally, a <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concession to
                            Libya on this point would be regarded as still another political triumph
                            by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We have responded to Libya’s passport policy by temporarily delaying the
                            issuance of visas to most categories of Libyans visiting the United
                            States. Exceptions have been made for Libyan officials going to the
                            United Nations, businessmen dealing with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> companies, and students. By far the largest category of
                            Libyans coming to this country are students, now numbering nearly 1,000.
                            It has been our belief that denying students entry into the United
                            States would have no meaningful effect on Libyan passport policies and
                            would jeopardize whatever longterm <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            interest there may be in developing a cadre of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-trained Libyans.</p>
                        <p>The one area where we have some leverage with the passport problem is
                            Libyan Government employees coming to this country for training. Libya
                            is anxious to obtain training for its personnel in areas such as air
                            controlling, electronic maintenance, agricultural training, and to a
                            lesser extent in business administration. When such training is with
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agencies, such as the Federal
                            Aviation Administration, no loss to private <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> firms would be involved if we held up visas to the
                            Libyan candidate. However, most of this training is with private <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> firms and is associated with contracts
                            for the sale to Libya of equipment and services. If we held up visas to
                            such trainees, <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> firms would suffer.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> displeasure over Libyan policies,
                            however, would be apparent.</p>

                            and Libya, the difficulty in developing any dialogue with the <gloss

                            Egypt, and the difficulties of operating the mission because of
                            limitations on staff and numbers of personnel resulting from Libyan
                            passport policy.</p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pro</hi> 1. The Mission makes possible intelligence
                            gathering and other reporting on the Libyan scene. Absence of an
                            official presence in Libya could significantly weaken our ability to
                            gather intelligence on Libya.</p>
                        <p>2. We still have a consular and protection function which diplomatic
                            presence can facilitate; our departure would be a psychological blow to
                            the resident <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> community and <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil companies. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> community relies on the Embassy for
                            emergency communications and coordination of E&amp;E planning.</p>
                        <p>3. Our presence would permit us to benefit from any change in the Libyan
                            regime from the outset; experience has shown that it is difficult to
                            re-establish diplomatic relations with Arab states once they are
                            broken.</p>
                        <p>4. Should we initiate a break, we would be handing <persName

                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>5. Libya might retaliate to a break with a gesture of defiance such as
                            seizure of one or more of the American oil companies or harassment of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> citizens.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Con</hi> 1. Initiating a break in relations ourselves
                            would signal our displeasure with Libyan policies, especially to other

                        <p>2. Communications on important matters with the Libyan regime could still
                            be made through an Interest Section or third parties.</p>
                        <p>3. Intelligence on Libya could still be gathered to some degree without
                            our official presence in Libya.</p>
                        <p>4. Our ability to gain consular access to protect American citizens is
                            already negligible; our departure would be little real loss to the

                        <p>This issue arises out of the impending application by Lockheed to export
                            eight C–130s to Libya, beginning in September 1973.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pro</hi> 1. We have never told either Lockheed or the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> specifically that we will
                            refuse to allow export of the aircraft;</p>
                        <p>2. Refusal to allow export of the planes would risk a major confrontation
                            with Libya; diplomatic ties may be broken, more <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> oil companies may be nationalized.</p>
                        <p>3. Denial of the C–130s will not inhibit Libya from purchasing aircraft
                            from other countries, possibly from France or the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>4. Such sales preserve some American contact with the Libyan armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_62"/>
                        <p>5. The United States benefits from the exports and the company benefits
                            from the business.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Con</hi> 1. Libya’s actions toward the <gloss

                            challenging; there is no national interest requiring us to strengthen
                            its armed forces.</p>
                        <p>2. Increased airlift augments Libya’s ability to move arms and other
                            material to the Palestinians and insurgent groups. It may also support
                            subversive activities in countries friendly to the United States, e.g.,
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>3. At some point, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government
                            should reply to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> with a
                            firm “no”; all the efforts to seek an improvement in our relations have
                            come from the American side.</p>
                        <p>4. We would not achieve any significant change in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Libyan relations by an affirmative response; our major

                        <p>5. We have told Lockheed that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Government approval of the deliveries is unlikely.</p>
                        <p>6. We can expect criticism from Israel and elements of <gloss

                            Substantially, the same arguments exist in this case for and against
                            delivery as in the case of the C–130s, except that the F–5s were covered

                        <p>This issue arises out of the requirement that <gloss target="#t_USG_1"

                            used to justify individual sales, e.g., by Italy, are of a long-term
                            nature and could be used for justifying future sales.</p>

                            briefing) When you talk about the status of our representation in Libya,
                            you’re hitting the State Department where it hurts.</p>

                        <p>I’d like to discuss first some general issues as we did in our meeting on
                            the Persian Gulf. Then I’d like to raise some issues concerning the oil
                            companies which we will discuss in more detail at the <gloss
                                target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> meeting on energy on Friday. These
                            will obviously have to be settled in terms larger than Libya. Third, I’d
                            like to talk about a number of concrete issues which have arisen. Let’s
                            raise the oil company situation first, then defer discussion to Friday.
                            The oil company incentives are just basically different from ours. I
                            have yet to meet an oil company executive who is not an idiot
                            politically. (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>) I
                            make an exception, of course, for drillers and producers. The oil
                            companies’ argument that their interests are identical to the national
                            interest should be examined. They don’t seem to be able to concert their
                            actions at all. They give in to the most outrageous demands and then
                            just pass along the increased costs to the consumer. Once this happens
                            in Libya, it will spread to the Persian Gulf. The companies should talk
                            to us before they get in trouble.</p>
                        <p>I know the mythology is that any attempt by the consumer countries to get
                            together will produce a confrontation with the producer countries.
                            That’s a shibboleth and we should consider whether it is really true.
                            What do we mean by confrontation? What is the price? This is a dangerous
                            process where year by year the oil companies are driven toward a
                            solution. Libya set the pattern for Saudi Arabia. We got involved in
                            Saudi Arabia, then the companies chickened out.</p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_69"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: I have a tangential
                            question in the matter of calling on the consumer nations to consult
                            with the producer nations and that is the Japanese bilateral
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll have a
                            discussion on the whole issue on Friday. I don’t know whether we would
                            want an across-the-board agreement among the consumer nations or
                            consider what the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> might do
                            unilaterally. I assume the Occidental issue is down the drain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Yes, and Libya cut
                            production 50% today. Amoseas will probably fold, then Oasis will. It’s
                            an ongoing process.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s discuss the
                            other two issues: our general strategy and how to apply it to some
                            concrete issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Our tactic has been
                            to hang in and see what happens when Libya merges with Egypt, if it
                            does. We did what we could for Bunker Hill, but it wasn’t much. Our
                            problem is that we have a lack of contact with any high-level Libyans.
                            We could send a high-level emissary over to try to get some assurances
                            concerning our interests. The reason why the consumer nations are
                            chicken is that the commodity is in relatively short supply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If Libya hadn’t
                            stopped production, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would
                            be a miserable little shiek running around in the desert. Who needs whom
                            more in this exercise?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: The consumers need
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> more than he needs
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As long as they
                            are not united.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: You can’t hope to get
                            anything resembling unanimity from the consumers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Also you must
                            remember that, when you are talking about the European market, this is
                            handled outside normal commercial interests. These dealings are all
                            government-to-government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Yes, Libya will have
                            no problem disposing of the stuff in Europe—and to our best allies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Right; Italy is one
                            of the worst offenders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: We have no specific
                            suggestions. We think the idea of the emissary is worth exploring. The
                            Libyans want some things that they might trade off. You should know that
                            there is not unanimity in State on the idea of an emissary. But we don’t
                            see how to proceed because we have no access.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We could try to
                            create a situation in which they would want access to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Interesting, but
                            how?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Their big market is
                            Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="0097" xml:id="pg_70"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: There is one
                            outside chance, based on my experience with and knowledge of the
                            Algerians. The Libyans are being well coached by the Algerians. Libya’s
                            technical and management capability is coming from the Algerians. I’ve
                            seen this thing orchestrated over the last couple of years as various
                            Algerians go in and out of Libya. I think you can track what’s happening
                            in Libya to the coaching they are receiving from these young Algerian
                            revolutionary types.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: But these Algerians
                            are doing business with us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Precisely. Our
                            business may not be with Libya. The Algerians need us and need us badly.
                            I’m talking about things like marketing and capacity—things that are
                            well beyond their capabilities. If we could talk to them, that’s the
                            only access I know of.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>) What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: I’m interested in the
                            comments on Algeria. I worked with the Algerians on the LNG deal. It
                            might be a possibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Are we on a good
                            enough basis with the Algerians?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: Some of us are with
                            some of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do we want
                            the Libyans to do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: We should aim at
                            stabilizing our interests in Libya. Our oil investment there is
                            important. They should let our people in and out—we’ve taken a lot from
                            them because we have an eye on our main interest—petroleum. I hope Bill
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> is right but I
                            don’t have the feeling that the Algerians are ready to oblige us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I didn’t say they
                            were. They won’t do anything unless there is something in it for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you want
                            the Libyans to do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Petroleum is the most
                            important element. We can reduce our presence if our major interests are
                            stabilized. But one by one we see our interests diminished, made
                            unprofitable or removed from our control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are they doing it
                            by inadvertance? We want Libya to stop subverting our oil. What’s in it
                            for them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: They want a major
                            change in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy in the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: The Algerians have
                            already done this with the French.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We tried to drag
                            our feet on letting El Paso in, but the oil companies were on our necks.
                            Now they’re getting the same thing done to them in Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: You’re right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Only two years ago
                            they were driving us crazy when we held up approval on El Paso to avoid
                            problems in the other Arab countries.</p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_71"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I suggest we staff
                            out a proposal on what an emissary might offer in return for what we
                            want.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s a policy
                            question whether the country which is most directly opposed to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests, which constantly harasses us,
                            rates an emissary, no matter what he says. Why not send an emissary to a
                            friend? We have two approaches: to try to isolate and punish Libya or to
                            buy them off. (Referring to Tripoli’s 1044) I never thought I’d see a
                            cable from our people in Tripoli that I’d agree with.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: We have three options:
                            1) to face up to Libya’s salami tactics by trying to work out a more
                            cooperative relationship, through an emissary and possibly a trade deal.
                            I think this is not the time and not the right country. I doubt if we
                            could get a trade-off worth our while.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: This is Joe’s view
                            but it isn’t Casey’s or mine.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: 2) We could temporize
                            and hold on by stringing it out; 3) we could really move in the
                            direction of the Tripoli telegram and begin to apply a policy of
                            loosening our relations with Libya, begin to take a position with regard
                            to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to reduce our
                            relations and contact. We could try to get the oil companies to take a
                            more unified, concerted posture and see what leverage we can develop to
                            demonstrate to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> that his
                            actions may be at the expense of his relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. This only makes sense if we concert
                            with the oil companies so that they enter into some sharing arrangement
                            between the majors and the independents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And some sharing
                            plan with the Europeans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: Yes; I don’t know how
                            feasible this is. But these are three broad options. I haven’t looked at
                            them in detail, and we haven’t really looked at the third possibility at
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: There’s a fourth
                            option: let the Europeans worry about the place and say to hell with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: I’d like to be tough,
                            but I just don’t see the chips. Only 3% of our imports come from Libya.
                            That’s inconsequential. But 25% of West Germany’s imports and 22% of
                            Italy’s imports come from there. The Libyans could hurt us by cutting
                            down exports to Europe which would mean a critical increase in
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: The Europeans have a
                            direct interest in this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: And time is on the
                            Libyan side. They could cut them off for six months during the heating
                            season.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would we be
                            doing that might provoke their cutting the Europeans off in the heating
                            season?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: If we took a tough
                            stand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You mean if we
                            said we won’t sell them military equipment? They might say give us 100
                            F–4s or we will cut off our exports to Europe.</p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_72"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: The biggest pain
                            would be if the oil companies yank their people out. The Libyans have no
                            replacement cadre of trained people. They’re not like the Algerians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Wouldn’t it be in
                            the Europeans interest to send people in?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: They don’t have a
                            large supply of that kind of technician.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: They have 2800 oil
                            company people there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: There’s nothing to
                            prevent them from getting technicians from somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: But it would hurt
                            them temporarily. I’m thinking of the Suez Canal situation. They could
                            pick up people in a year or so but, in the short term, it would hurt
                            hell out of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: Maybe we don’t have
                            the chips, but we haven’t examined the chips we have. I would hate to
                            have the Arab world see Libyan blackmail of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> pay off. I want to be sure we don’t have a few chips.
                            The very spectre of our playing a few chips would have an effect on
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and Faisal. Sadats
                            wants out of his close connection with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I don’t see the
                            chips. Libya has $3 billion in reserves. The Europeans can’t last.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let the Europeans
                            play with Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I’m trying to protect
                            our investment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So the most
                            militant Arab who has subverted regimes all over Africa and as far away
                            as Ireland and in every respect works counter to us, gets a senior
                            American emissary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I don’t say a senior
                            American emissary. We would have to approach it very carefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What level?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: I don’t know. We can

                                Rush</persName>, for example.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: For what end?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: To stabilize our
                            interests and protect the companies. We at least should be on the record
                            as trying.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Every time someone
                            starts using American money to subvert our interests, are you going to
                            send him an Under Secretary of State? You understand I don’t
                            underestimate the talents of Under Secretaries, or their charm.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It depends on their
                            success. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is not that
                            successful. The situation is not as dangerous as implied. But oil is
                            important and, if we can get the Europeans in too, all the better.</p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="0100" xml:id="pg_73"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If he isn’t
                            successful, why do it? Send the Europeans an emissary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: The Europeans will
                            fold; they will send him technicians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There must be an
                            alternate between pulling out the technicians and sending an Under
                            Secretary. You know he wouldn’t go empty-handed. Would he give them
                            military equipment?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: If it is the nature
                            of the beast, we will bargain. If we don’t get what we want, we won’t
                            play.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do we
                            want?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Some protection of
                            the companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: You’re talking
                            about tens of billions of barrels of oil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Most of which goes
                            to Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, but there is
                            the future. It’s $4 billion now but it will be $8 billion in a year or
                            two.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But is the way to
                            do it to give the most intransigent state the most conspicuous
                            attention? Let’s play with Faisal or <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and let the Libyans stew in their juice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: What do you
                            mean?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Follow our present
                            policy and our own time-table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: It doesn’t necessarily
                            follow that Libya will cut production. It is not in the interest of
                            Libya to get to the point where they are taking a cut in revenues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Simon</persName>: You can do it for a
                            short time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: They will go ahead on
                            their demand for 51% but that doesn’t mean automatically there will be
                            less oil for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> or for Europe. The
                            oil companies will pass the price increases along to the consumers. In
                            fact, they may want <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to
                            impose it on them—to be able to say they couldn’t help the price
                            increases. One piece of leverage is that Libya wants to keep their
                            outlets for their oil along present lines.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: The governments of
                            Europe are in on this deal. You’re not talking about independent
                            companies. It is the governments operating through their
                            chosen-instrument oil companies. They will just keep selling in the
                            European market.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Fine.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: I was in Germany
                            when they got the people who assassinated the Israeli athletes. A high
                            German official said then that if <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> said release them or he would cut off their oil,
                            they would have to go along. They couldn’t tolerate chopping off 23% of
                            their oil imports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That may be true.
                            You’re saying whatever <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            demands, they will give unless they can get together. That makes
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> ruler of 20 million
                            people. If they’re willing, there is nothing we <pb n="74" facs="0101"
                                xml:id="pg_74"/>can do. We could send six emissaries out and build
                            up their prestige, but so far we can’t even get stamps in passports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Can we get that out of
                            the way? Can’t we give them Arab passports? So what? Is it really a
                            point of principle?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It’s the precedent we
                            create for other nasty people. We can do it, of course, if we can get
                            the Congress to agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do I gather that
                            all the items on this shopping list should wait until we decide on an
                            emissary?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Joe Sisco</persName> do a paper?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: It’s not his
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: An <hi
                                rend="italic">Iliad</hi> won’t be written about America in the
                            1970s! Let whoever has the options in mind do a paper. Let Joe
                            contribute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: We’ll let him see
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let Joe write his
                            option in detail and let the other people write their options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: We’ll staff out the
                            three options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What the package
                            would be, what the emissary would say.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: And include the
                            fourth option.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: We might send the head
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> as the emissary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: He’s not in the right
                            mood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, if you
                            expect to rely on charm. . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: There’s always
                            embargo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We need
                            international cooperation for that. The trouble with the consumers’
                            getting together is that it would lead to an Arab boycott. If the
                            consumers could pick off one, and not multiply the outcome, but the
                            experts say it can’t be done. I would like to see the emissary option
                            fully staffed out—what he would say and what they would get over a
                            period of time. I’d also like to see the <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1"
                                >Sisco</persName> option.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: Options 1 and 3 are
                            not mutually exclusive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s do it—get
                            all the departments involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Also could we look at
                            the question of the reconnaissance flights. I’d like to avoid another
                                <hi rend="italic">Pueblo.</hi> These flights aren’t worth it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought we were
                            having a general review of recce flights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: There’s no
                            intelligence value in these. We’re just running them to make a
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: Yes. If we let every
                            country draw a circle. . . . .</p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_75"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I agree, but don’t use
                            an intelligence asset. Fly a regular plane.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: It’s not a <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> asset.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I know—it’s a <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> asset.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll include this
                            in the recce review—it will be one of the first, or the first, to be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We’re not doing it for
                            intelligence purposes.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>: They haven’t
                            reacted. If they do, they will get bagged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ_1">Porter</persName>: Let’s put the
                            emissary in one of those planes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will review it.
                            If it serves no useful purpose, we will consider the political
                            implications and might cut down on it.</p>

                            that official who receives note transmit it to his superiors
                            immediately.</p>

                            oil companies operating in Libya do not accept proposals of the
                            Government of the Libyan Arab Republic for sale of a proportion of their
                            interests to it, <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> will nationalize
                            the operations of these companies in Libya. The United States Government
                            wishes to urge the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> to continue

                                >MFA</gloss> Official. Ref: Tripoli 1101. Summary: <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> has decided to fill out its
                            passports in English as well as in Arabic, Chargé told today. Clear
                            implication of original presentation of this fact was that <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> hoped <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> could reciprocate by somehow using Arabic in its
                            passports. Chargé discouraged this idea and his <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> interlocutor later denied that he was proposing a deal.
                            Believe we are on right track and should continue to stand fast. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Chargé was called down August 30 by <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> Acting Director General for Treaties and Legal
                            Affaires, Suleiman Attiga, to discuss “passport problem”. <gloss
                                target="#t_EmbOff_1">EmbOff</gloss> accompanied Chargé.</p>
                        <p>2. Contrary to our expectations, Suleiman did not focus narrowly on the
                            current Libyan aspect of the problem, namely delays in visas for
                            dependents of students. Rather, he made a presentation as follows: He
                            had been asked to talk to Chargé about restrictions on travel of Amer<pb
                                n="77" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_77"/>icans and Libyans in general. The
                            Libyan Chargé in Washington Hussein Zaggar had indicated that the
                            Department seemed inclined to show some flexibility on the subject (he
                            did not explain precisely what was meant by this). In any case, the
                                <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> would be interested in knowing
                            what that flexibility might be, e.g. the insertion of a page printed in
                            Arabic, or whatever. The <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> had made
                            a decision to print its passports in English as well as Arabic and to
                            fill them out in both languages. All missions would receive a circular
                            note to this effect within a couple of days. Could Chargé state what the
                            position of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was on this
                            matter?</p>
                        <p>3. Chargé replied that the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s
                            decision to print and fill out passports in English as well as Arabic
                            was a new fact that, of course, would be reported. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position had remained essentially
                            unchanged since the submission of our aide mémoire of November 15, 1972,
                            which Chargé summarized. That position boiled down to the principle of
                            equal treatment. Just as the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            recognizes the right of <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> to issue
                            passports in any languages it chooses, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> expects the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> to
                            recognize U.S. passports printed in our national language.
                            Correspondingly, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> believed that
                            the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> did not have the right to
                            require the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to print its passports
                            in a language other than English. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> had himself stated this principle in his
                            interview that was published in <hi rend="italic">Al-Ahram</hi> on May
                            27. (Attiga simply nodded when he heard this.) Chargé also pointed out
                            the legal and practical difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> of following any other course. At the same time he
                            would point out that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> too hopes for
                            a resolution of passport problems on both sides, and that in fact there
                            had been no difficulties in this area prior to January one.</p>
                        <p>4. Attiga returned to the theme that <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> was now interested in “solving the passport issue”
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. This time he urged that
                            the U.S. adopt a rubber stamp like other countries. “I can guarantee
                            that if you do that there will be no more problems for Americans.”
                            Chargé immediately replied that this was “incredible” as <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> had made perfectly plain, even by
                            note, that rubber stamps were only a temporary solution and that the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s request was for printing
                            passports in Arabic. Accompanying <gloss target="#t_EmbOff_1"
                                >EmbOff</gloss> expressed same incredulity. Attiga then said “what
                            you are saying, then, is that there is no flexibility on your side.”
                            Chargé replied that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had always been
                            flexible enough if there was reciprocity, but that it was inconceivable
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would start printing passports
                            in any other language than English. Attiga expressed great
                            disappointment that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could not at
                            least accept a rubber stamp.</p>
                        <p>5. Since in his initial presentation Attiga had seemed to link the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> decision regarding printing
                            passports in English as well as Arabic with a hoped-for “flexibility” on
                            the U.S. side, Chargé summarized <pb n="78" facs="0105" xml:id="pg_78"
                            />Attiga’s position to him making the implication explicit. Attiga
                            denied that this implication was intended, however, and emphasized that
                            the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s decision was quite
                            independent and final. He also indicated that the Ministry had received
                            instructions from the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> on the whole
                            subject of passports within the last two days, and that his talk with
                            the Chargé was at the request of the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs.
                            He said he would report to him regretfully that the American position
                            had not changed. Chargé said that was correct.</p>
                        <p>6. In passing, Chargé briefed Attiga, who did not appear aware of the
                            facts, on the problem of contemporary visas for dependents of eligible
                            principals applying at the Libyan Embassy Washington, on the occasional
                            but serious problems of denials of entry to American dependents at the
                            airport, on the fact that the Embassy had only one consular officer, who
                            was overworked and had instructions to give priority to other work
                            besides visas, and on the fact that Chargé had not been granted an
                            interview at the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> or ministerial
                            level since January 1, except for one appointment with ForMin Kikhya.
                            Chargé also made clear that there was no split between the Dept and the
                            Embassy on passport policies, that the Department made policy and the
                            Embassy carried it out, and that if the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> was not happy with those policies one approach would
                            be for somebody at a high level in the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> to discuss the matter with the Chargé.</p>
                        <p>7. Chargé took opportunity to raise several other matters including a
                            strong demand for prompt payment of the Embassy’s Balfour Day claim
                            (septel). Also pointed out passports were a small matter compared to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/Libyan relations in the field of
                            petroleum. <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> had recently
                            nationalized one American company and forced other into partial
                            nationalization. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> urged continued
                            talks with the remaining companies until there is an amicable solution.
                            Instead of cooperation in this field there was constant harassment.
                            Latest event was two-weeks’ notice to president of Mobil to leave his
                            house despite a valid lease. Similar problems had been experienced
                            recently by other American companies with residences in that area
                            (former Gargour estate).</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: As best we can analyze it at this time, the motive for
                            today’s interview was as follows: <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>
                            decided for some reason, possibly an agreement with Egypt regarding
                            standardization of passports, to start issuing passports printed not
                            only in English as well as Arabic (as since January 1972) but filled out
                            in English too. This decision had nothing to do with our passport
                            policies, but at same time <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> is
                            under heavy pressure from many students regarding visas for their

                                target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> in its meeting on August 14. It
                            describes the three policy options available to the United States with
                            respect to Libya. These options are based on the following assumptions:
                            a) the United States still has significant, although sharply reduced,
                            financial interests in Libya which it should seek to preserve; b) an
                            uninterrupted flow of Libyan oil is essential primarily to Western
                            Europe and important to the United States; c) the <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> regime is the one with which
                            the United States will have to deal in at least the short-term
                            future.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Petroleum</hi></p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concern with Libya stems basically
                            from the importance of Libyan oil. In 1972, the net book value of the
                            American investment in the Libyan oil industry was approximately one
                            billion dollars, and this investment made a contribution of $400–$500
                            million to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> balance of payments.
                            In that year, Libyan oil accounted for 14 percent of OECD European oil
                            imports and about 4 percent of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil
                            imports. This oil is of particular importance because of its low sulphur
                            content and would be difficult to replace at this time.</p>
                        <p>In June, Libya nationalized Bunker Hunt over the opposition of the
                            company. In August, it forced Occidental and Oasis to yield 51 percent
                            of their concessions on the threat of total nationalization. On
                            September 1, it nationalized 51 percent of the remaining American oil
                            companies (with the possible exception of Murphy Oil, a partner in a
                            four-member consortium having only a small production). The book value
                            of American assets in Libya was estimated before the nationalizations to
                            be one billion dollars; since June, they have been cut therefore
                            approximately in half.</p>

                        <p>Libya pursues an extremist but carefully calculated foreign policy, one
                            in which its priorities are clearly defined and supported by Libyan <pb
                                n="81" facs="0108" xml:id="pg_81"/>economic resources and tough
                            negotiating stances. It opposes the existence of Israel, argues for its
                            liquidation by military means, and seeks to counter a negotiated
                            settlement in any form. This posture, bolstered by the regime’s vast
                            financial resources, leads Libya to exert a disruptive influence in the
                            Middle East, the Mediterranean and Africa. Libya supports subversion,
                            insurgency and terrorism in the Arab States and elsewhere, and advocates
                            the use of Arab oil resources as a political weapon to undermine western
                            and particularly <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> support of Israel.
                            It supports Palestinian terrorism as a legitimate weapon in the “Arab
                            battle” against Israel. Libya’s machinations have increasingly isolated
                            Israel diplomatically. (See Appendixes B and C to <gloss

                        <p>Under this option the United States would make no special effort to
                            improve relations with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>,
                            but at the same time would seek to avoid reactions which could inflame
                            the situation further. This would be fundamentally a waiting tactic on
                            the assumption that one of two developments may occur in our favor in
                            the next year or two: either that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s mercurial leadership will generate enough
                            indigenous opposition to cause his ouster; or that under an eventual
                            Egyptian-Libyan merger some of the more extreme aspects of <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s anti-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> policies will be submerged by a more moderate Egyptian
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>In effect, this would be a continuation of our present policy. Under it,
                            we would retain the flexibility to move to either a more punitive or
                            more forthcoming policy if circumstances warranted. Moreover, under this
                            option, while <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> undoubtedly
                            will go ahead on taking over more and more of the oil resources, it does
                            not necessarily follow that the oil will be denied to the American
                            market. Under this option the United States would make no special effort
                            to approach the Libyan regime with the objective of seeking a basis for
                            a less hostile relationship. Nor would the United States take actions
                            hostile to the Libyan regime such as the termination of military sales
                            and the supply of spare parts. In effect, our present policy would
                            continue unchanged.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we would:</p>
                        <p>—continue to allow the flow of spare parts and ammunition for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military equipment already in the Libyan
                            inventory.</p>
                        <p>—not formally turn down the Libyan request for eight C–130’s, but inform
                            Lockheed that it should tell the Libyan Government that the lack of a
                            positive decision by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government
                            forces Lockheed to seek another buyer for the aircraft in the event the
                            decision is negative. (Libya may regard this notification by Lockheed as
                            the equivalent of an official <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            turndown; if so, a confrontation between the United States <pb n="82"

                            unavoidable.)</p>
                        <p>—renew the Lockheed maintenance contract every six months on an interim
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>—not authorize sale of an air defense-radar system to Libya, but make no
                            effort to instruct the interested companies to cease their discussions
                            with the Libyan Government. Advise the companies, however, that sale of
                            equipment that would compromise equipment used by the United States and
                            its allies would not be authorized.</p>
                        <p>—work out a practical compromise on the Arabic-in-passports problem
                            should this prove necessary to keep a modest <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> official presence in Libya and enable the oil companies
                            to continue operations. If this can be worked out, we would continue to
                            issue visas for Libyan students to come to the United States.</p>
                        <p>—continue our present policy of support for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> oil companies, including any legal efforts by them to
                            block the sale of “hot” oil.</p>
                        <p>—continue to run periodic <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military
                            flights through Libya’s proclaimed “restricted” area if required for
                            intelligence purposes or in support of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> right to fly over international waters. We would avoid
                            to the maximum extent consistent with attainment of the foregoing
                            limited objectives flight tracks which could precipitate a confrontation
                            with Libya.</p>
                        <p>—seek to keep a small mission going in Tripoli, but do not accredit a new
                            ambassador.</p>
                        <p>—not seek the good offices of other Arabs.</p>

                        <p>This option would involve informing the Libyan Government that the United
                            States is prepared to send a high-level special emissary to explore with
                            Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and Prime

                            would be to find, if possible, a way of preserving the remaining <gloss

                            sharply reduced. As those interests continue to erode, the desirability
                            or practical usefulness of invoking this option correspondingly
                            declines.</p>
                        <p>Libya may refuse to receive a special <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            emissary or use his visit as an occasion on which to castigate the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government for its support of
                            Israel. Nevertheless, by offering to send one, the United States would
                            have demonstrated for the record, both at home and to other Arab
                            countries, that it had tried to reach an accommodation before taking the
                            negative decisions affecting Libya that now seem inevitable if the
                            present deterioration in Libyan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            relations continue. If Libya refused <pb n="83" facs="0110"
                                xml:id="pg_83"/>to receive the emissary or declined to engage in
                            serious discussion with him, the United States would proceed to other
                            options. If Libya did agree to receive him, he would state that:</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government is now considering a
                            number of matters of interest to Libya, including 1) approval for a
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> company to install a modern air
                            defense radar system for Libya (sell only air defense equipment that
                            would not compromise equipment used by the United States and its
                            allies), 2) sale of an additional eight C–130’s, 3) renewal of the C–130
                            maintenance and training agreement, and 4) continuation of the sale of
                            spare parts and ammunition for military quipment previously sold to
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>—At the same time, we are faced with Libyan actions in a number of fields
                            that make it difficult for us to respond positively to these requests.
                            These actions include 1) the nationalization of American oil interests
                            in Libya in violation of the Concession Agreements and generally
                            recognized principles of inernational law, 2) a Libyan visa policy that
                            makes normal Embassy operations impossible and imposes hardships on
                            American citizens working in Libya, 3) the recent attempt to shoot down
                            an unarmed <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> aircraft over
                            international waters off the Libyan coast, and 4) repeated high-level
                            Libyan attacks on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>—The purpose of his visit is to see if the Libyan Government is
                            interested in reaching an accomodation on these points.</p>

                        <p>—Open discussions, before the end of 1973, for the settlement of
                            outstanding <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> private claims against
                            Libya;</p>
                        <p>—Assure the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Goverment that:</p>
                        <p>—the remaining American oil assets in Libya would not be further
                            nationalized for at least five years.</p>
                        <p>—compensation agreeable to the Libyan Government and to the affected
                            companies would be paid promptly to the latter if further nationalized
                            after five years.</p>
                        <p>—accept American passports as valid travel documents qualifying otherwise
                            eligible American nationals for Libyan visas (we would do the same with
                            respect to Libyan Arabic-language passports).</p>
                        <p>To the extent that Libya indicated its willingness to take these actions,
                            the special emissary would indicate his willingness to recom<pb n="84"

                            interest to Libya listed above. He would not attempt to negotiate
                            specific agreements on these questions since the purpose of his visit
                            would be to ascertain whether a meaningful dialogue were possible, not

                            <hi rend="italic">Option 3: React</hi></p>
                        <p>Under this option the United States would begin a process of measured
                            overt retaliation against Libya for actions inimical to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests. The decision to invoke this
                            option could result from either of two situations: a) continued Libyan
                            actions adversely affecting <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests
                            in Libya or elsewhere, or b) a subtantial reduction in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in Libya which would minimize
                            the Libyan Government’s opportunity to retaliate against the United
                            States directly. Retaliatory bilateral actions are limited, but could
                            include the following:</p>
                        <p>—cancel outstanding munitions control licenses and halt the flow of spare
                            parts for American military equipment previously sold to Libya;</p>
                        <p>—inform Lockheed that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Givernment
                            will not authorize the export of the eight C–130’s which Libya hopes to
                            begin receiving in November 1973, and tell the company that the planes
                            should be sold to another buyer since the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> decision against Libya was final;</p>
                        <p>—refuse, as a matter of general policy, authorization for third-country
                            sales of military equipment or technology to Libya;</p>
                        <p>—refuse to authorize the sale of an air defense-radar system which Libya
                            is interested in purchasing from an American supplier; instruct the
                            interested companies to cease all discussions with the Libyans on this
                            subject;</p>
                        <p>—terminate Lockheed contract for C–130 maintenance and training;</p>
                        <p>—delay indefinitely the issuance of visas to Libyan students and to other
                            Libyan travelers to the United States, unless Libya issues visas to
                            Americans who wish to travel to Libya notwithstanding the absence of
                            Arabic from their passports;</p>
                        <p>—take steps to discourage the travel of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> citizens to Libya, thereby restricting Libyan access to
                            American petroleum expertise;</p>
                        <p>—vigorously support <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> companies in their
                            legal pursuit of “hot” oil in the United States and abroad;</p>
                        <p>—continue U.S. reconnaissance or operational flights through Libya’s
                            proclaimed “Restricted” area, HLR 22.</p>
                        <p>Under this option the United States would also begin a process through a
                            variety of channels to try to limit Libyan influence. In doing so, it
                            would seek the cooperation of friendly governments, including <pb n="85"
                                facs="0112" xml:id="pg_85"/>Arab governments, in intelligence
                            exchanges regarding Libyan activities and possibly in supporting
                            political, media and other elements opposed to Libyan extremism. Such
                            approaches would be based on the proposition that <persName

                        <p>Exercise of the foregoing option could result in the Libyan closure of

                        <p>187972. Subject: Libyan Passport Problem. Ref: Tripoli 1137.</p>
                        <p>1. Department believes reconsideration and decision on passport issue
                            timely since Sept. 1 has come and gone and it appears that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will have to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>/Jallud <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss> for the foreseeable future. Department particularly
                            concerned over prospect of erosion Embassy staff, especially in commo
                            and secretarial areas resulting from normal transfer and other
                            situations. Such erosion will inevitably detract from operating
                            effectiveness of post, thereby vitiating rationale behind continued
                            maintenance of Embassy (see para 2). Finally, now that every other major
                            country represented in Libya has agreed to put Arabic in its passports
                            in some form, we see no prospect that <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> will modify policy it has publicly announced to suit
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Since Department wishes to maintain and staff post in order to
                            preserve essential reporting, consular and protection services, some
                            adjustment in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> passport policy
                            applicable to Libya must be found. (Swiss note cited Tripoli 1143 is a
                            “beau geste” but as Embassy points out even Swiss have in fact used
                            Arabic stamp to preserve their Embassy in Tripoli.)</p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_86"/>
                        <p>3. Accordingly, we propose as a test case to seek a visa from Libyan
                            Embassy, Washington, for a communicator to replace Schauer, after
                            placing bilingual rubber stamp in his passport. If queried by Libyan
                            Embassy, Department would reply that this procedure will be used only
                            for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials traveling to Libya on
                            official business, in interest of preserving official relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>. If <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> announces that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            “has agreed to put Arabic in its passports,” Department in reply to any
                            queries here would state this procedure is not rpt not being generalized
                            and will be used only on case by case basis to staff Embassy Tripoli.
                            Simultaneously, Embassy Tripoli would be instructed to issue visas to
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> officials assigned
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>4. Department realizes there will be requests by <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> companies in Libya for Department to provide same
                            service for dependents of its employees, although perhaps less than
                            before nationalizations. We plan to reply exception to passport policy
                            for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> official purposes is based on
                            national, as distinct from private commercial, interests and that if
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> wants <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> personnel to operate its oil industry, we assume it will

                            Libya. Ref: State 187972.</p>
                        <p>1. For management reasons, have tried in half a dozen ways to get an
                            accurate reading on whether the continuance of this post was still a
                            U.S. objective and if so how much we willing to pay for it. For years
                            the post had listed its own continuation as an effective mission as the
                            top <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> objective in Libya, and this
                            had met with no objection from Dept. On other hand it obvious that, as
                            post squeezed down by a host govt that increasingly hostile in overt
                            ways, the effectiveness of this mission was becoming increasingly moot.
                            In wake of Khartoum, Dept itself indicated informally that rationale for
                            closing the post almost compelling—but not quite. Since then we have
                            lost two key officers, restrictions on normal life and operations are
                            even tighter, and the case for closing out is stronger than ever.
                            However, <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> states Dept wishes
                            to maintain post in order to preserve essential reporting and consular
                            and protection services—and for this is willing to pay a price in terms
                            of our passport policies. This is a political price, because the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> made Arabic-in-passports a political
                            issue and we accepted the challenge by not acquiescing.</p>
                        <p>2. So far as I am aware, there is no objective reason for us to hand the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> a political triumph at this
                            time. Altogether to the contrary. The only reason to acquiesce is to
                            keep this mission afloat. For how much longer? If for a period of six to
                            eight months, acquiescence is not necessary; we can manage somehow if
                            the objective is clear and the end is in sight for each of us here. If,
                            however, the idea is to keep the post open indefinitely, acquiescence
                            makes more sense, on the ground that national interests occasionally
                            dictate loss of face. Would underline that this is involved, not only in
                            accepting Arabic in our passports, but almost everywhere we turn
                                here—<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> property in Tripoli, U.S.
                            private interests nationalized without compensation, and the welfare and
                            protection of remaining Americans. Frankly our functions in these areas
                            are largely ineffective and mostly symbolic, and will remain so for the
                            foreseeable future unless this post is beefed up and the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> eventually moderates its hostility
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. There is little reason to
                            believe the latter will happen; rather we are the victims of salami <pb
                                n="88" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_88"/>tactics, aimed precisely at
                            keeping us preoccupied by defensive measures, hence inoffensive and
                            ineffective. Why, and how long, should we be willing to accept this
                            humiliating position for the sake of other national interests? American
                            oil interests in Libya? Their days are numbered, whether or not we
                            maintain the post.</p>
                        <p>3. Raise these questions not because I presume to have the authoritative
                            answers but because this is the time to ask such questions again. We are
                            at a watershed in Tripoli. If the decision is to keep the post open
                            temporarily, then at least we should fix some dates in order to make
                            plans and adjustments. If the decision is to try to keep the post open
                            indefinitely, and hopefully more effectively, then we must not only
                            accept Arabic in passports but move fast on new personnel assignments,
                            including additions to the staff. Has the Dept addressed the full range
                            of consequences to its wish to keep the post open?</p>
                        <p>4. Would appreciate a response to the above before going into detailed
                            recommendations on other matters raised <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1"

                        <p>1. Following are my best answers at this time, formulated after
                            discussion with my four officers.</p>
                        <p>A) No, Libyan actions to date do not suggest a <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> determination to force us out, either in the sense of
                            breaking relations or in terms of closing this Mission. Had <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> determined to achieve either of
                            those objectives, believe they would have seized several opportunities
                            to force the issue. (Suspect, without having proof, that <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> debated this point after Libyan
                            airliner shot down in Sinai on February 21, and that its decision was to
                            take full revenge against either U.S. or Israel <pb n="89" facs="0116"
                                xml:id="pg_89"/>whatever the consequences, i.e., to accept any
                            consequent <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> decision to close this
                            Mission, but not to force it to close by direct pressure. Reasons for
                            this last proviso, which might be called the plateglass aspect of the
                            post, would have been a fear of U.S. countermeasures against Libyan
                            security or economic interests. Doubt that Libyan diplomatic interests
                            in U.S. per se figured much—except possibly the thought that, so long as
                            Soviets represented in Tripoli, some U.S. presence here helps preserve
                            LAR’s non-aligned image. <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> is not
                            much interested in its Mission at Washington, partly because its Mission
                            at NY opens a barn door to our country anyway.)</p>
                        <p>B) Yes, agreeing to put Arabic in passports probably would allow us to
                            continue to operate this Embassy. To say “would assure us” is too
                            strong, as we are talking about both the future and someone else’s
                            intentions. My estimate is that we could continue to operate, barring
                            another disaster at Israeli hands like the LAA incident, or a
                            U.S./Libyan military confrontation involving loss of life, or of course
                            a new Arab/Israeli war. The effectiveness of our operations is another
                            matter, and for Dept to judge, but I doubt if they could be much
                            improved in quality, given the political environment here. The very fact
                            of our acceptance of Arabic, if it comes to that, will reveal the
                            hostage aspect of the post and not make its mission easier. For other
                            reasons too I would in fact expect increasing operating difficulties—but
                            not to the point, whatever it is, where we consider operations
                            impossible or completely ineffectual. <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> harassment is just that, and we can continue to
                            “operate” so long as we get fresh blood.</p>
                        <p>2. As <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> received today, have not
                            obtained latest reading from any DPL colleagues on their estimates of
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> intentions toward continued
                            presence of U.S. and other foreign missions. Can say from recent
                            conversations, however, that general estimate is that unity with Egypt
                            is off, so we are all stuck here, regrettably. On passport issue, our
                            closest allies, if they can be called that in this context, all tend to
                            think we have put up a magnificent but quixotic fight against the
                            inevitable. Their present worry is that rumors come true and the next
                            slice of the salami will be a deadline for printing foreign passports in
                            Arabic. Few doubt that this will happen before long, in which case the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will look less quixotic—but no
                            more than an example to be followed than before (unless we start

                        <p>The evolution of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan relations over
                            the past four years has left us with very little leverage in that
                            country. We have no aid programs of any kind and there are no diplomatic
                            actions which we could take which would have any significant effect on
                            Libyan policy. Some economic or military sanctions might hurt Libya but
                            they would be unlikely to change Libya’s basic attitude or actions
                            toward the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> or on the Middle
                            East.</p>

                        <p>The United States might break diplomatic relations with Libya and close
                            our Embassy in that country. This would be a clear sign of our
                            displeasure with Libyan policy but would have little effect on the
                            present Libyan leadership. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> sets little store by diplomatic relations. Libya
                            has been without a Foreign Minister for nearly a year. The Libyan
                            Embassy in Washington has been headed by a junior first secretary for
                            more than six months and high level diplomatic contacts with the Libyan
                            regime in Tripoli are rare.</p>

                        <p>There is considerable evidence that the majority of the Libyan population
                            and at least some members of the <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>
                            are opposed to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            extremist views on a number of matters. It might be possible to work
                            with these elements to attempt to replace him. However, there is no
                            identifiable focus of dissidence in Libya around which any political
                            action program could be developed. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s Middle East policy and his nationalist policy
                            at home enjoy substantial support among the generally apathetic Libyan
                            masses. A successor regime would find it difficult to change those
                            policies.</p>

                        <p>The Libyan government has been seeking to purchase significant quantities

                            licenses for such material we could weaken but not cripple Libya’s
                            military capability since Libya can acquire the same or comparable

                        <p>There are now approximately 2,000 American citizens in Libya, most of
                            them oil company employees and their dependents. The Libyan oil industry
                            is operated primarily by these American technicians. The <gloss

                            remaining in or going to Libya. However, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> lacks legal authority to prevent Americans from going

                        <p>Libya’s clout rests on the financial strength generated by its oil
                            industry. If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> were to ban the
                            export of spare parts and other equipment used by the Libyan oil
                            industry, the operating efficiency of the latter would be diminished but
                            not necessarily damaged to an excessive extent. To the extent that oil
                            output would be reduced by such <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            action, the consumers of Libyan oil—chiefly Western Europe—would be
                            affected adversely. A ban of this character could lead to complete
                            nationalization of the remaining <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil
                            company assets in Libya and would not necessarily diminish Libya’s
                            financial strength since the <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>
                            could charge more for its reduced—and hence more valuable—output per

                        <p>The Libyan government now sends a number of its employees to the <gloss

                            companies, such as United <pb n="92" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_92"
                            />Airlines, and with the Federal Aviation Administration. There are also
                            approximately seven hundred Libyan students in the United States doing
                            both graduate and undergraduate work. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> could take steps to prevent Libyans from attending
                            government-sponsored training courses and discourage private
                            universities from accepting Libyan students. Neither of these actions,
                            however, is likely to have much effect on the policy of the present

                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> once again the subject
                            of the pending sale by the American firm Northrop-Page of an air defense
                            system for Libya. As you know, we have been informed that the Libyan
                            Government has selected Page Communications, a branch of Northrop-Page
                            Corporation, to install a 150 million dols air defense system, provided
                            the company can obtain the required authorization from the U.S.
                            Government. The company has told us that there is the possibility that
                            the amounts involved will be significantly higher than this figure by
                            the time this project is completed—to our knowledge, this is a strictly
                            defensive and fixed system. The British and the French have also been
                            involved in the bidding for this contract and there have been
                            unconfirmed indications that the Libyans may have discussed an air
                            defense system with the Soviets recently.</p>

                        <p>Since this contract is basically a system of a defensive character, and
                            is a system which the Libyans can buy, in any event, from other sources,
                            we would like to consider going ahead on this matter and approving this
                            sale. However, I do not want to go ahead with this project without,

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                        <p>The deterioration in Libyan-Egyptian relations over the last month adds a
                            new and potentially dangerous element to the Middle East equation. While
                            the feud at this point is still confined to a bilateral arena, its
                            causes stem from fundamental differences between the two sides over how
                            to confront the Israeli enemy and in their perception of the role the
                            superpowers should play in Middle East politics. Should either Cairo or
                            Tripoli escalate the quarrel, events could be set in motion that would
                            affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in the area. An
                            Egypt heavily embroiled with its neighbor would be a less energetic and
                            convincing Arab leader in peace negotiations. More important, the Soviet
                            Union, frustrated by President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and seeking new footholds in the Middle East,
                            might see advantages in fostering the Libyan side. Under the worst
                            circumstances, a full-fledged vendetta could lead to the assassination
                            of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_95"/>
                        <p>We believe that practical economic and political considerations will help
                            to restrain both sides, but in such a highly charged atmosphere, the
                            possibility of a more serious confrontation cannot be ruled out. It is,
                            therefore, useful to explore various scenarios that could bear directly
                            on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Situation</p>
                        <p>Following a prolonged period of Libyan sniping and posturing, Tripoli now
                            finds itself on the defensive. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> has recently retaliated with a scathing public
                            attack on President <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, the
                            recall of the Egyptian ambassador, the withdrawal of the entire Egyptian
                            military mission in Libya, and an implied threat of more detrimental
                            actions. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s current strategy
                            of blaming <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> personally for
                            Libya’s transgression is intended to drive a wedge between the Libyan
                            leaders and the 10 other members of the ruling Revolutionary Command
                            Council. By distinguishing <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> from other “well-intentioned” Libyans, Cairo is
                            giving an implicit blessing to any who might consider a direct challenge
                            to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s power. The
                            withdrawal of Egyptian military support for <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s rule gives point to that signal and at the
                            same time is probably designed to foment uncertainty within the Libyan
                            armed forces, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s major
                            prop.</p>
                        <p>So far, the Libyan leadership has remained united in the face of Cairo’s
                            challenges, claiming that it will take no retaliatory measures. Indeed,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and his colleagues
                            are doing all they can to appear calm and reasonable, if only to prevent
                            a panicky exodus of indispensable Egyptian civilian workers. Libya’s
                            uncharacteristic restraint may not hold for long, however.</p>
                        <p>Both sides have made vague insinuations of superpower involvement in
                            their differences; Egypt opened with the suggestion that Libya has
                            become a Soviet pawn and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            countered with accusations that Cairo is acting on Washington’s behalf.
                            Each has charged the other with both petty harassment and blatant
                            subversion, charges that—although somewhat exaggerated—contain a strong
                            element of truth.</p>
                        <p>Very little was accomplished during the recent meeting between <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> in Alexandria. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> half-heartedly offered to send an emissary to
                            Tripoli to carry on with reconciliation talks and both sides reaffirmed
                            their agreement to stop propaganda attacks. Neither side, however, seems
                            prepared to compromise on areas of fundamental disagreement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Immediate Consequences for Both Sides</p>
                        <p>Libya has far more to lose than Egypt as a result of this quarrel.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s denunciation has
                            deepened <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s isolation from
                            the Arab mainstream and reinforced his image as a dangerous meddler in
                            international affairs. The rift probably also has brought closer to the
                            surface <pb n="96" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_96"/>private disagreements
                            between <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and his
                            colleagues, who have for some time questioned the wisdom of their
                            leader’s open antagonism toward Cairo’s policies. Although the Libyan
                            people are happy to see the hated Egyptians go, many of the
                            well-educated have a sober appreciation of Libya’s dependence on
                            Egyptian goodwill. Should Cairo pursue the dismantlement of its once
                            cooperative alliance with Tripoli, the Libyan government and economy
                            could be paralyzed—at least temporarily—by the withdrawal of tens of
                            thousands of Egyptian laborers and workers, who hold key posts
                            throughout every public institution. Under such circumstances, Libyans
                            would ultimately blame their own leaders for the chaos and stagnation
                            that would follow. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            regime would then be seriously vulnerable to divisiveness within its own
                            ranks and to challenges from abroad.</p>
                        <p>Cairo is also paying a price for the rift with its neighbor. Although the
                            return of its military men and equipment will reinforce defenses at
                            home, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> now has little choice
                            but to return a squadron of Libyan Mirages, integrated into the Egyptian
                            air force for over a year. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            may also feel obligated by appearances to relinquish other Libyan
                            contributions to its war machine.</p>
                        <p>Cairo would have difficulty reabsorbing returning workers and employing
                            Egyptians who normally would seek jobs in Libya. Although the absorption
                            could be more easily accomplished in the midst of Egypt’s current
                            reconstruction program, this problem could still be troublesome at a
                            time of domestic restlessness and high expectations. The amount of
                            repatriated income would also drop. Furthermore, Egypt would lose the
                            option of turning to Libya as an alternative to Saudi Arabia’s financial
                            help.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Two Angry Men</p>
                        <p>These practical issues may not be sufficient to dissuade either <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, both of whom can be emotional and
                            self-righteous about their respective grievances.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is an impetuous
                            brinksman spurred on by his belief that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s policy of negotiation spells the end of
                            pan-Arabism. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> wants first
                            and foremost a united Arab nation purged of Zionism and free from all
                            communist and Western political and cultural influences. For him, this
                            goal is a matter of religious conviction that brooks no compromise or
                            hesitation.</p>
                        <p>As Libya has discovered its inability to strike Israel directly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has become more
                            antagonistic toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> which he sees
                            as a hostile force totally aligned with Israel. His antipathy toward
                            Washington is matched by an equally contemptuous attitude toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, which he views as a
                            dangerous atheistic force with designs on the Arab world. These
                            suspicions are amplified by his fears that current <pb n="97"

                            by the superpowers to divide up the world at the expense of the Arabs
                            and other non-aligned nations. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> sees <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s desire for a settlement with Israel and Egypt’s
                            rapproachment with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> as evidence
                            that the Egyptian president has either been duped or is wittingly
                            cooperating in a dangerous scheme.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is willing to treat with
                            Washington or Moscow to obtain arms and technical help and he is
                            prepared to make some of the right gestures to get them. The conclusion
                            of a major arms deal with Moscow and several friendly overtures toward
                            Washington are recent examples of his willingness to bend if Libya’s
                            interests are served. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>,
                            nevertheless, is inflexible in his fundamental views. His fears and
                            antagonism are now focused on <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>, who by his recent challenges to Tripoli, has
                            provided <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> with final proof
                            of betrayal to the Arab cause.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, for his part, is fed up
                            with his reckless and uncompromising neighbor. For months, the long
                            suffering <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> ignored Libya’s
                            public condemnation of Egypt’s management of the war and its subsequent
                            effort to muster Arab support for negotiations. However, evidence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s meddlings in
                            Egypt’s domestic politics has frightened the Egyptian leadership, which
                            is keenly aware that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>—as
                            self-appointed successor to Nasir—has some following among Egyptian
                            students and military officers. Cairo is also worried that Tripoli’s
                            anti-Egyptian propaganda campaign—especially charges of siding too
                            closely with Washington—may play into the hands of other Arabs who would
                            like to challenge Cairo’s leadership of the Arab bloc.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, dealing with the young
                            and mercurial <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> sparks
                            strong emotions and sometimes over-reaction. Although <persName

                            capable of moderating the Libyan leader, his tolerance is now drained.
                            Against the advice of some of his key advisors, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> no longer intends to coax and
                            persuade a man he has come to view as a direct and dangerous
                            adversary.</p>

                            Tension</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have demonstrated an interest in recent months in improving
                            what have been very strained ties with Libya. The most significant
                            aspects of this development have been Jallud’s May visit to Moscow and
                            the conclusion of a major arms deal.</p>
                        <p>Moscow undoubtedly thinks <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            is a useful thorn in <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s
                            side. The Soviets probably take some satisfaction that the back-biting
                            between Libya and Egypt distracts <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and brings his leadership of the Arab world into
                            question. The Soviets appear to have entered into their arms deal with
                            Tripoli partly because they calculate it will have an unsettling impact
                            on <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s own military—who have
                            been cut off from Soviet arms for over four months. In addition, Moscow
                            would <pb n="98" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_98"/>welcome any increased
                            Libyan dependence on it for military aid and advisors.</p>
                        <p>Moscow, however, must be wary lest its support for Libya damage its long
                            term prospects with Egypt which it still views as the dominant Arab
                            country. The Soviets recognize Egypt’s importance at the Geneva peace
                            talks and still hope they can influence <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s policies. Egypt is too important for Moscow to
                            abandon completely, but the Soviets are in no hurry to make decision
                            regarding Egypt since they may think <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s position at home to be weakening. The Soviets
                            would not want to lose their port facilities in Alexandria which remain
                            very useful to them or to jeopardize their future use of the Suez Canal.
                            Furthermore, they do not want to damage their relations with other Arab
                            States by interfering openly in an intra-Arab dispute. The Soviets have
                            thus avoided direct criticism of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> in order to avoid an open break with Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets also have misgivings about <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, whom they regard as dangerously erratic. They
                            are deeply suspicious of his Muslim fanaticism and resentful of his
                            continuing criticism of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. They
                            would not want to commit themselves deeply in a situation over which
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would retain
                            control.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Developments</p>
                        <p>We see only faint signs that either side is serious about opening a new
                            dialogue, thus we anticipate that the situation will gradually worsen
                            along the following lines.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Scenario A:</hi> Both parties will probably break the
                            propaganda truce worked out in early August and a new acrimony will
                            creep into public exchanges. This may involve more direct charges of
                            superpower manipulation of the quarrel.</p>
                        <p>Cairo may actively encourage the return from Libya of key categories of
                            Egyptian civilians, who even on their own may feel compelled to go home.
                            Tripoli might, in turn, recall its military trainees and students in
                            Egypt. Harassment of individuals at border points would intensify,
                            frontier guards might be reinforced, and the possibility of an incident
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>Libya may react to Egypt’s lead and recall its ambassador in Cairo. Both
                            sides, however, may want to avoid a formal diplomatic break, if only for
                            appearances’ sake.</p>
                        <p>Both sides would probably step up efforts to foment trouble among tribes
                            that live astride their common border.</p>
                        <p>At this stage Cairo might also quietly encourage the defection of one or
                            more of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s colleagues.
                            Major <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Abd al-Munim al-Huni</persName> is
                            known to be one of Cairo’s favorites, although Prime Minister Salam
                            Jallud would be a more logical choice given Cairo’s ostensible rationale
                                <pb n="99" facs="0126" xml:id="pg_99"/>that an eclipse of <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> should be a “corrective action”
                            rather than a coup.</p>
                        <p>Tripoli, for its part, might use such assets as it may have among
                            conservative religious factions and the armed forces inside Egypt to
                            increase disruptive incidents.</p>
                        <p>Both sides would incur some risks and disadvantages were they to pursue
                            this course. Egypt would have to consider the possibility that its
                            actions might:</p>
                        <p>—cause Libya to turn to the Soviets for manpower to fill vacancies in the
                            Libyan air defense system and to seek Moscow’s moral and political
                            support.</p>
                        <p>—tarnish <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s image as a
                            statesman capable of maintaining Arab solidarity</p>
                        <p>—give radical fedayeen elements new incentives to strike at Egypt
                            directly</p>
                        <p>—cause those Egyptians already skeptical of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s policies to become more wary</p>
                        <p>—rally other Libyan leaders to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s side.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the Soviets would probably see advantage in
                            encouraging Libyan intransigence without appearing to challenge
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> directly. If Moscow
                            could overcome <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            opposition to a substantial Soviet presence, it could quickly dispatch
                            several hundred military advisors to fill the void left by the
                            Egyptians. Moscow would be willing to sell and quickly deliver even more
                            military equipment. The Soviets would also discreetly encourage the
                            Libyans and seek to stir up criticism of the Egyptians actions as
                            disruptive to Arab unity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> might calculate that these
                            disadvantages would be outweighed by the possibility that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> might be silenced and cast
                            again into isolation if Egypt were to take the measures outlined above.
                            We believe there is some possibility that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> under this type of pressure might adopt a more
                            conciliatory position—at least over the short run—in order to avoid
                            internal political and economic disruptions. On the other hand, if the
                            two sides were unable to arrive at some middle ground the situation
                            might mushroom along the following course.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Scenario B:</hi> A formal diplomatic break might be
                            initiated by either or both sides. Borders would be closed and all
                            cooperation, even at the lowest levels of administration, would stop.
                            Real or alleged violations of airspace and territorial waters would be
                            likely causes of serious incidents.</p>
                        <p>Each side would lobby for support among other Arab and non-Arab states.
                            Calls for emergency meetings of regional and international organizations
                            might be issued by either side. The situation would be considered cause
                            for an Arab summit—if not by the two ad<pb n="100" facs="0127"
                                xml:id="pg_100"/>versaries, perhaps by other concerned Arab
                            governments. Mediation attempts by other Arabs would undoubtedly be
                            undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Either party might try to drag the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> or
                            the Soviets more directly into the fray.</p>
                        <p>If—as Cairo charges—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has
                            assassination squads inside Egypt, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and other Libyan detractors could possibly become
                            targets. Cairo would perhaps retaliate with its own terrorist campaign
                            but would probably concentrate its efforts on convincing other Libyan
                            leaders or anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> elements
                            in exile to move against the Libyan leader.</p>
                        <p>Such actions would be extremely risky and difficult to control. We do not
                            believe either side wants to carry its grievances this far, but we do
                            not rule out the possibility that the momentum of events could
                            precipitate such a collision course. Egypt would have to weigh the
                            following possible consequences:</p>
                        <p>—a vigorous Soviet response to Tripoli’s plea for help that might include
                            posturing of its Mediterranean fleet and the dispatch of “advisors” and
                            weapons</p>
                        <p>—a negative reaction from other Arabs—particularly Egypt’s chief allies
                            in Saudi Arabia—who are traditionally fearful of Egyptian
                            interventionist policies</p>
                        <p>—polarization within Palestinian ranks among pro- and anti-Libyan
                            factions</p>
                        <p>—exploitation by Israel of Egypt’s preoccupation with Libya that might
                            include a major stall on negotiations</p>
                        <p>—a harmful impact on an international investment community wary of
                            instability in the area.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the Soviets would have to move carefully lest they
                            risk an open rupture of their relations with Egypt. They might take some
                            conspicious action such as flying in additional arms or dispatching
                            Mediterranean fleet units to Libyan ports to indicate political support
                            for Libya. Moscow would be willing to provide technical and economic
                            advisors although it could hardly replace the tens of thousands of
                            Egyptian civilians now in Libya. The Soviets probably would not dispatch
                            their own ground or air combat forces to Libya or engage in any blatant
                            show of naval force since this would appear to be direct intervention in
                            inter-Arab affairs and commit Moscow to the probable loser if war should
                            ensue. They might, however, hint at such actions in an attempt to deter
                            Cairo.</p>
                        <p>If the situation ever reached the point described above, we do not forsee
                            either side backing down easily. In fact, the regime in Tripoli might be
                            so badly shaken and divided that it could not effectively represent
                            itself in negotiations either in Cairo or before a mediation forum.
                            Should efforts to stabilize the situation fail, either side might
                            venture <pb n="101" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_101"/>along a dangerous and
                            foolhardy course that might involve the following actions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Scenario C:</hi> Egypt might openly attempt to mount a
                            coup against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. Cairo’s
                            ability to select an alternative to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> and to manipulate an evolving chain of events
                            has been greatly reduced by the withdrawal of its military units and
                            advisors, who were Egypt’s ears, eyes, and muscle in Libya. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is the force that binds the
                            ruling council together; he also enjoys personal loyalty from many key
                            elements in the military. Although he is not popular among middle class
                            Libyans, he has a charismatic hold on many Libyan people. Should Egypt
                            succeed in overthrowing <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>,
                            its selected successor would have serious difficulty controlling the
                            disparate elements in Libyan society. Public knowledge of Egypt’s hand
                            in a coup would trigger an outpouring of opposition to Cairo among
                            Libyans, who universally dislike the Egyptians. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would immediately become a
                            national martyr.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans might seriously attempt to assassinate <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>. Even if the attempt were
                            cleverly disguised, most Egyptians would reflexively suspect Tripoli.
                            Whether such an attempt succeeded or failed, the full force of the
                            Egyptian military and political establishments would probably undertake
                            a campaign against Tripoli as a task of national honor.</p>
                        <p>If either side tried such a move, a military clash would be a clear
                            danger. In any such confrontation—be it limited or full scale—Libya
                            would be completely overwhelmed.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, the Soviets would avoid any direct commitment to Libya
                            in order to avoid being pulled into a military conflict. Moscow would
                            encourage its Arab clients to press for a cease-fire and mediate the
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>To prevent a Libyan loss in such a conflict, Moscow would have to
                            introduce substantial air and ground combat units. Such an action would
                            put Soviet forces into direct combat with Egypt, damage seriously its
                            position with other Arabs and severely strain détente with the <gloss

                        <p>We consider this scenario to be only a very remote possibility. The
                            damage to both countries—both internally and internationally—would be
                            severe and long-lasting. Almost every Arab nation could be expected to
                            condemn an open confrontation.</p>

                            formative stage. The argument concluded that members of the
                            Revolutionary Command Council could be receptive to moderating
                            influences, and that covert action could convey such moderate influences
                            to the Libyan regime in such a way as to achieve the basic U.S.
                            objective of maintaining normal friendly diplomatic and commercial
                            relations with Libya, including the protection of U.S. oil

                        <p>2. The political evolution of the Libyan regime has been definitively

                        <p>221657. Subject: Libyan Minister of Treasury Calls on Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Libyan Treasury Minister <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1">Muhammad
                                Az-Zaruq Rajab</persName> took the initiative to call on Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> on October 4.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1">Rajab</persName>, in Washington as the
                            head of the Libyan delegation to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> conference, asked
                            for a high-level meeting to discuss U.S.-Libyan relations. He said he
                            was taking this initiative in order to begin a process which would quote
                            bridge the gap unquote between our two countries. He stressed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> not only desired better
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> but was also a
                            bulwark against communism in the Arab world. He said that his government
                            was puzzled by quote anti-Libyan unquote actions taken by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. As examples he mentioned the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> action in quote pulling out unquote
                            its Ambassador and the withholding of export permits for the eight
                            C–130’s.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> welcomed the
                            Minister’s initiative and his stated desire to improve relations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> said that we have a
                            continuing interest in finding ways to improve our bilateral relations.
                            He made it clear that we would like to consider the Minister’s visit as
                            a possible first step toward resumption of the dialogue between Libya
                            and the United States. It was, nevertheless, not clear that the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> really wanted a general improvement
                            in relations with the U.S. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1"
                                >Sisco</persName> stated that on the basis of past actions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>, it was too soon to talk
                            about specific issues. He stressed that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> refuses to be kicked around and mere anti-communism is
                            not a sufficient basis to establish a dialogue. Any framework for a
                            productive dialogue would have to be based on mutual understanding and
                            respect. Given the deterioration in our relations, starting with the
                            Libyan expulsion of the United States from Wheelus Air Base, we needed
                            to be convinced that the Libyans actually want to have good
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> told the Minister
                            that he would report his conversation to the Secretary and that he
                            assumed the Minister would report to his government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> suggested that both sides could
                            now consider <pb n="104" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_104"/>how to continue
                            this dialogue. The Minister sought a concrete gesture to show our quote
                            good faith unquote. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>
                            said there could be no preconditions and it was not appropriate to think
                            in terms of gestures at this stage. He said that a further exchange of
                            views would be necessary, one which would focus on the important
                            requirement of each side trying to understand the broad objectives and
                            thinking of the other side. Once such an understanding existed, it would
                            be possible to address more specific questions.</p>
                        <p>4. It is not clear to what extent <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1"
                                >Rajab</persName> represented views of <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss>. Request that Embassy provide any available information

                        <p>1. Believe Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1">Rajab</persName>
                            must have been acting on <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>
                            instructions, probably from PriMin Jallud, in calling on Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> and in raising points
                            he did. <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1">Rajab</persName> seems to have
                            confidence of regime leaders, but doubt that this civilian technician
                            minister would have acted on his own in this important matter outside
                            his field. In fact his talking points seemed to be limited and generally
                            similar to those raised by <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                            Political Director Shaybani with Chargé in May (Tripoli 518).</p>
                        <p>2. Inclined to believe main reason for approach was <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s great desire to obtain Dept’s
                            approval on export of their C–130’s. Also believe we should take at face
                            value their expressed interest in general improvement of bilateral
                            relations, and proceed on realistic basis stated <pb n="105" facs="0132"
                                xml:id="pg_105"/>by Under Secretary, para 3 <gloss
                                target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss>. We will have to learn if
                            Libyans agree to this basis or whether they will continue to maintain
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should first make gesture,
                            i.e. release C–130’s. <persName corresp="#p_RMA_1">Rajab</persName>
                            returned to Tripoli Oct 9, and we can assume Jallud will soon be briefed
                            on talk with Under Secretary.</p>
                        <p>3. Problem any foreign representative has in policy talks with <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> is that usually only <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members have authority to react,
                            compromise or decide on points of importance. Further, while individual
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members greet and talk with
                            visiting dignitaries, they are normally not available to resident
                            diplomats. Other officials, including civilian ministers, seem to
                            operate within scope of brief instructions from <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss>. Some improvement in this situation in foreign affairs
                            field could come about soon, however. Reorganization of Foreign Ministry
                            has been under consideration for months, and Ministry officials have
                            told me new set up, possibly with <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>
                            Major <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Abdul Muneim Al-Huni</persName> as
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>, might be announced
                            within coming week. If Al-Hune becomes a working <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>, there would be better channel
                            to <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> agrees to exchange of views
                            on broad objectives of each side, perhaps we could begin by working
                            together on identifying areas of discussion. Overriding issue separating
                            our two govts is, of course, settlement of Middle East crisis. Aspect
                            which concerns <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> most is
                            satisfaction of Palestinian claims, and full exchange of views on this
                            would seem to be central to idea of dialogue. Other major area of actual
                            and potential differences is oil policy which leads into Libya’s deep
                            interest in economic development and regime’s concerns and
                            misconceptions about U.S. superpower domination.</p>
                        <p>5. Embassy could take up with <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                            question of <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s agreement to
                            proceed on basis we envisage and then discuss specifics of a loose
                            agenda. Having reached that point, suggest AFN Director <persName

                            contacted Embassy duty officer and asked that Chargé come immediately to

                            asked to come in Chargé’s absence. Najib Shaybani Director of
                            International Affairs at Ministry, delivered following note, in sealed
                            envelope:</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text of Embassy translation of note: The Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs presents its compliments to the Embassy of the USA, and asks it
                            to inform its government of the following note: On Jan. 10, 1975 at 0810
                            hours (local time) American aircraft carrier was located at a distance
                            of 60 miles north of Misuratah, 60 degrees Tripoli latitude 15.5 east,
                            and 34.30 north. A number of aircraft belonging to the carrier in
                            question undertook three flights until they were only 10 miles distant
                            from dry land. The aircraft in question pursued an Algerian civilian
                            passenger aircraft which was passing through the area.</p>
                        <p>3. The violation of areas reserved for civilian aviation, and the
                            hindrance on its movement, and the threat to its security, and the
                            pursuit of civilian aircraft passing through it (i.e. the area), are all
                            considered complete air piracy. The operations of approaching (i.e. the
                            Algerian aircraft) by themselves are considered an aggressive action
                            which American forces have committed, and for which they bear the
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>4. The Government of the Libyan Arab Republic, which has undertaken on
                            its part several serious and positive initiatives, might have received
                            their counterpart, and like initiatives might have been taken on the
                            part of the United States. If the objective of the above mentioned
                            actions was threatening, we not the sort to accept it or to be cowed by
                            it. If the objective of the above mentioned activities was to prepare
                            for action of another kind, we are completely ready to face it. If the
                            action took place by mistake, then it is incumbent on the Government of
                            the United States to apologize and to determine who made the mistake. In
                            all cases, the Libyan Arab Republic reserves its right to formulate and
                            to take the actions which it deems appropriate in this regard to carry
                            out <pb n="107" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_107"/>its duty and its right to
                            protect its land and its air space and its waters. The Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs takes this occasion to express to the Embassy of the USA
                            its esteem.</p>
                        <p>5. While presenting note, which <gloss target="#t_PolOff_1"
                                >PolOff</gloss> did not open, Shaybani was at great pains to soften
                            its contents, which he summarized in moderate terms. He then elaborated
                            point that Libya had unilaterally taken several positive steps toward
                            U.S., of which he mentioned only the lifting of the oil embargo and “a
                            decision to buy a Triga III reactor from General Atomic”. Other positive
                            initiatives toward the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be
                            taken in the future, Shaybani said. He hoped that the United States and
                            Libya could put aside their differences on the “Palestine question”, and
                            work together in other areas for mutual benefit. This was in interest of
                            both countries. In reply, <gloss target="#t_PolOff_1">PolOff</gloss>
                            said he knew nothing of any aggressive actions by U.S. planes. <gloss
                                target="#t_PolOff_1">PolOff</gloss> said he was sure that any
                            “positive Libyan initiatives would be given careful consideration by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>”. He reminded Shaybani that
                            Chargé had asked for note on lifting of oil embargo. Shaybani said that
                            American desk officer Shaaban had informed Chargé officially that
                            embargo was lifted, but if it would be useful, he was prepared to ask
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1"
                                >Al-Huni</persName> whether a note could be prepared. The proof that
                            embargo had been lifted was in fact that oil shipments were now actually
                            going to U.S. <gloss target="#t_PolOff_1">PolOff</gloss> said he thought
                            note would be useful. Shaybani was cordial throughout interview, which
                            lasted about 20 minutes, and was conducted in Arabic.</p>

                        <p>1. Please deliver the following note at appropriate level of the Foreign
                            Ministry at earliest opportunity.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text. (After compliments) the Government of the United States
                            acknowledges receipt of the note of the Libyan Arab Republic of January
                            10, 1975 concerning the flights of United States military aircraft on
                            January 10 and wishes to inform the Libyan Arab Republic that these
                            aircraft at no time approached closer than 25 nautical miles of the
                            Libyan coast and remained at all times over international waters under
                            positive radar control. The flight personnel were aware of the presence
                            of civilian aircraft in the area and maintained appropriate distance
                            from these aircraft. There was no pursuit of civilian aircraft nor were
                            civilian aircraft in any way endangered by these flight operations. The
                            Government of the United States wishes to assure the Government of the
                            Libyan Arab Republic that the United States aircraft in question were on
                            a routine mission over international waters, in keeping with the
                            longstanding United States position on freedom of flight in such areas.
                            Such flights in no way constitute a threat against any sovereign nation.
                            The United States Government takes note of the reference to several
                            serious and positive initiatives by the Government of the Libyan Arab
                            Republic and would like to inform the Libyan Arab Republic that it is
                            prepared to continue the dialogue begun by these initiatives in the hope
                            of improving the state of relations between our two governments.

                            Personnel.</p>
                        <p>1. Deputy Undersecretary for Technical Affairs Ahmad al-Atrash called
                            Chargé to Foreign Ministry April 14 to inform him that Libyan Govt has
                            decided to remove the numerical ceiling on personnel of this Embassy
                            imposed in 1972. He referred to increased number of Libyan students in
                            U.S. (giving their number now as 1500) and economic relations as
                            business which could require increased Embassy staff. Al-Atrash was not
                            sure whether we had Consulate in Benghazi. When we told him it had been
                            closed in 1972 he suggested we might want to open it again. (This seemed
                            to be spur of the moment improvisation by Al-Atrash.)</p>
                        <p>2. In reply to Chargé’s question, he said that this was <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> decision. It would not be made public,
                            and we would not be informed in writing. Chargé asked whether British
                            and Soviet missions, whose staffs were limited at same time ours, were
                            included. Al-Atrash said that they probably would be, but stressed that
                            for moment decision only applied to U.S. Chargé agreed this was a
                            positive step, and he hoped it would be part of a trend. Al-Atrash said
                            he hoped for his part that “ball would be kept rolling”.</p>
                        <p>3. This gesture is intended to draw a reciprocal action from us. As Dept
                            aware, Libyans would like to increase staff of their Washington Embassy,
                            as they are doing at many of their other missions, but their intent is
                            probably also to show good faith. We have the feeling that senior
                            civilian officials in Foreign Ministry and elsewhere are anxious for
                            better relations with us, and this gesture may be result of their
                            urgings. Libyan initiative is not directly related to troublesome area
                            between us of military supply. It tends to emphasize more suitable area
                            of bilateral relations—growing student program, increased trade,
                            financial links and export of American technology. We believe it would
                            be appropriate for us to take reciprocal action. Our response will have
                            greater effect if it follows closely on Libyan gesture.</p>
                        <p>4. However, if we do respond in kind, by lifting ceiling on Libyan
                            Embassy personnel in Washington, as Foreign Ministry probably <pb
                                n="110" facs="0137" xml:id="pg_110"/>hopes, next Libyan move may be
                            to raise exchange of Ambassadors. In present state of relations,
                            allowing the prospect of an exchange of Ambassadors to arise could only
                            be embarrassing to us. We can see no sign that regime’s line on Mideast
                            is susceptible of [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>] modification, and believe
                            present level of mission is appropriate.</p>
                        <p>5. With these considerations in mind, Embassy suggests that Dept
                            authorize Chargé to reply to Al-Atrash orally along following lines: We
                            welcome Libyan gesture. In response we are lifting ceiling on Libyan
                            Embassy in Washington. At same time we have no present plans to increase
                            our staff in Tripoli, or to change nature of our representation. We are
                            able to conduct present business with our staff of seven officers, but
                            we are happy to know that it could be increased if need should
                            arise.</p>
                        <p>6. Dept may also wish to consider a visit by a ranking <gloss

                        <p>130498. Subject: <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan Relations. For
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. Libyan Government delivered a note to the State Department on April 14
                            requesting agrément for Mohamed Yunis Khalifa as Ambassador to the
                            United States. On April 15 the Libyan Government informed our Chargé in
                            Tripoli orally that the ceiling on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Embassy personnel in Libya had been lifted. The Secretary has approved a
                            recommendation that we accept Mr. Khalifa as Ambassador in Washington
                            and that we inform the Libyans of our willingness to increase the
                            ceiling on Libyan Embassy personnel in Washington on condition that both
                            of these steps first be discussed with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and that these moves not be
                            implemented until our Middle East reassessment is completed.</p>
                        <p>2. During your next conversation with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> you should advise him of our
                            inclination to accept Khalifa as Libyan Ambassador in Washington and of
                            our intention to negotiate a new and higher ceiling on Libyan Embassy
                            personnel in Washington with the Libyan Government. Both steps will take
                            place after the completion of our Middle East reassessment. We would
                            welcome any comments President may have.</p>
                        <p>3. If President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> questions
                            you on these moves you may wish to point out that the absence of a
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Ambassador in Tripoli and a
                            Libyan Ambassador in Washington was not the result of a decision by
                            either government to expel or not to accept an ambassador from the
                            other. The existing situation came about when the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> decided not to replace Ambassador
                            Palmer upon his departure at the end of his normal tour because
                            Ambassador Palmer had not been received at levels of the Libyan
                            Government appropriate for his rank and had been able to have very
                            little contact with any Libyan citizens. The Libyan decision not to
                            replace their Ambassador in Washington followed our decision not to
                            replace Palmer with another Ambassador. The acceptance of the Libyan
                            Ambassador therefore represents no significant change in <pb n="112"
                                facs="0139" xml:id="pg_112"/><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            policy and might be a step toward better communication between our
                            governments. The increased number of officers in the Libyan Embassy in
                            Washington are needed primarily to take care of the large number of
                            Libyan students studying in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. If asked, you may also tell President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> that we have no present intention of assigning an
                            Ambassador to Tripoli although we would be willing to do so if there is
                            some trend toward an improvement in relations between our two
                            governments and if we have an indication that he would be received at
                            appropriate levels by the Libyan Government.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: While we are asking you to
                            inform <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> of our plan, we will
                            want your judgment of his reaction before any step is taken. We do not
                            want to put him in a position of making a decision for which we must
                            assume responsibility, but we naturally want to take his reaction into
                            account before moving.</p>

                            State 130498.</p>
                        <p>1. Since President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is
                            scheduled proceed directly from Suez to Alexandria, where he will remain
                            for the summer, I discussed referenced subject with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>. I told him of our intention to
                            accept Khalifa as Libyan Ambassador to Washington and to negotiate a new
                            and higher ceiling on Libyan Embassy personnel in Washington with the
                            Libyan Govt. These steps, I pointed out, will not take place until after
                            completion of our Middle East policy reassessment. I asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> to advise the President of the
                            above, adding we would welcome any comments <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> might have.</p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_113"/>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> asked about the
                            background of this development. I therefore told him about the Libyan
                            note of April 14 requesting agrément for Khalifa as Ambassador to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the April 15 action by the
                            Libyan Govt lifting the ceiling on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Embassy personnel in Libya. I pointed out that the absence of
                            Ambassadors in the respective capitals was not the result of a decision
                            of either government to expell or not to accept an Ambassador from the
                            other, but came about as a result of our decision not to replace
                            Ambassador Palmer at the time of his departure at the end of his tour
                            because the Libyan Govt had not received him at appropriate levels and
                            there had been no meaningful contact. Libyans had reacted by not sending
                            an Ambassador of their own. The acceptance of a Libyan Ambassador
                            represents no significant change in <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            policy and might be a step toward a better dialogue between our two
                            governments. Lifting the ceiling of the Libyan Embassy in Washington
                            enables the latter to take care of the large number of Libyan students
                            in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>’s reaction was mixed. He
                            viewed the Libyan initiative as an effort to balance their recent arms
                            agreement with the Soviets. Even though the Libyan actions had taken
                            place in April, he believed Libyan-Soviet discussions were by then
                            already underway. While this is desirable in principle, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> expressed concern that such
                            action on our part, coming now, will be viewed in Arab world as <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> endorsement of Libya’s recent massive
                            arms deal with the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>
                            expressed concern that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> seems to
                            minimize the Libyan-Soviet arms deal and fails to see it as a direct
                            threat to Egypt. (I know that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> made same point to visiting Saudi MODA Prince
                            Sultan a few days ago.) Apart from this aspect, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> noted Qadhaafi’s recent attacks
                            on <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> for attending the
                            Salzburg Summit and reopening the Suez Canal have become shriller and
                            have forced <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> to respond.
                            Thus, the <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>-Qadhaafi battle
                            of words is again the public domain. Actions such as we contemplate, if
                            they come now, will be viewed in Egypt and in the Arab world as a slap
                            at <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> or at the very least
                            indifference to his position. They would scarcely seem to be consistent
                            with the frequently stated <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy of
                            considering <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> as the key Arab
                            leader and working to strengthen his position. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> stated his comments represented
                            his personal reaction and undertook to let us have any comments the
                            President might have.</p>
                        <p>4. Shortly after above conversation, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1"
                                >Fahmy</persName> called to say he had discussed the matter with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and President’s
                            reaction is distinctly negative. For <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            to take proposed action now would vitiate positive reaction of Salzburg
                            Summit. They would be viewed in Egypt and the Arab world as a slap at
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and a lack of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concern about Qadhaafi’s scurrilous
                            attacks against <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and his
                            subversive activities in</p>
                        <p><pb n="114" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_114"/>Egypt. While the decision must
                            be made by <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, <persName

                        <p>1. You will have seen Cairo 5640 in response to Department instructions
                            about <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan relations. I thought it
                            best to speak generally in that telegram, but you should know that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> feels very strongly on
                            the issue. On <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s express
                            instructions, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> asked that we
                            postpone for six months repeat six months receiving Khalifa or
                            increasing the two countries’ respective Embassies. By that time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> said we will have
                            gotten rid of him, meaning Qadhaafi. In the meantime, he urged that
                            American Embassy Tripoli be instructed “to be vigilant”, about
                            developments and that we employ necessary sensitive means to monitor
                            Libyan activities.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no question that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            is at the moment deeply concerned about Qadhaafi and any steps that seem
                            to imply acceptance of Qadhaafi will be badly viewed here. Egyptians
                            have hard evidence of a Qadhaafi-organized assassination plot against
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and relations between
                            the two countries are at the moment worse than at any time in the past
                            two years. I suspect they are likely to deteriorate even more. As a
                            result, Egyptians have apparently made a policy decision to work
                            actively to find ways of getting rid of Qadhaafi. In my judgment, unless
                            the benefits accruing to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> from a
                            better dialogue with the Libyans are likely to be of a substantial
                            nature, we will be well advised to postpone action on the Libyan
                            initiative, especially at this sensitive time when we want <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s understanding and cooperation
                            in furthering the peace process.</p>

                        <p>711. Subject: Annual Policy Assessment for Libya. Ref: 11 FAM 212.4.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary: In the Embassy’s view the principal U.S. interests in Libya
                            are that (a) Libya not become a site for Soviet bases and area of
                            exclusive Soviet influence, and (2) that Libya give up its opposition to
                            an Arab-Israeli settlement. It is a fact that our power to promote these
                            interests in present circumstances is limited. We should, however,
                            continue to use what leverage we have. We should tell the Libyans
                            clearly that their attitude on the Middle East is a bar to better
                            relations, and that arms sales will be considered in light of the
                            regime’s attitude toward the Arab-Israeli dispute. We cannot compete
                            with the Soviets as arms salesmen to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s regime, and we should not try. We should not
                            rely too much on the argument that Libya is a problem for the Egyptians
                            to solve. Several structural factors are working in our favor over the
                            long term. One bright spot in the picture is the continued eagerness of
                            young Libyans to go to the U.S. for higher education, and the regime’s
                            willingness to finance their studies in U.S. universities. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. I. U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>A. In the Embassy’s view, basic U.S. interests in Libya are:</p>
                        <p>(1) That Libya, with its long Mediterranean coastline, not become an area
                            of exclusive Soviet influence or a site for Soviet military bases.</p>
                        <p>(2) That Libya stop trying to undermine the settlement process in which
                            Egypt is engaged with Israel.</p>
                        <p>(3) That U.S.-Libyan relations improve to the point where the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has access to Libyan policymakers.</p>
                        <p>(4) That the U.S. maintain its share of the Libyan market for goods and
                            services.</p>
                        <p>B. In the absence of a Middle East settlement, or a change of heart by
                            the regime with regard to the existence of the Jewish State, it is a
                            fact that our power to promote these interests is limited, as our
                            bilateral relations with Libya must be subordinated to our larger
                            interests in the area.</p>
                        <p>(1) We should, nevertheless, use what leverage we have with the regime.
                            It should be brought home clearly to the Libyans that, while we <pb
                                n="116" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_116"/>will not threaten them with
                            subversion or invasion, they can expect no consideration from us as long
                            as they continue to take a line on the Middle East which is directly
                            opposed to our vital interest in peace and the continued existence of
                            Israel. The best way to do this is not to ignore Libyan approaches to
                            us, or to deal with them in a tentative and piecemeal way.</p>
                        <p>(2) We should not rely too much on the argument that Libya is basically a
                            problem for the Arabs or the Egyptians to solve for us. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has enough appeal throughout
                            the Arab world to make it hard for our Arab friends to keep him in
                            permanent quarantine. In the case of Egypt, it should be remembered that
                            Libyans resent the Egyptian presence here; to some extent Egyptians have
                            become the focus for persistent anti-foreign feeling which used to be
                            directed against the U.S. and Britain under the monarchy. An overly
                            pro-Egyptian regime would soon find itself in hot water, especially if
                            its installation occurred through an Egyptian-backed coup. For this
                            reason, it would probably not be wise to encourage any Egyptian attempt
                            to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. Although we
                            are obviously sympathetic to the Egyptian position, we should not be
                            associated with any action which could redound to our discredit in the
                            rest of the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>C. There follows a discussion of some of the outstanding issues between
                            the U.S. and Libya in the light of overall U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>3. II. U.S. Arms Sales to Libya</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s military regime is
                            inclined to evaluate its relations with industrialized states in terms
                            of the willingness of those states to sell Libya arms. U.S. policy in
                            this area is based on a desire to avoid doing anything which could
                            strengthen Libya’s offensive capability or which could be read in the
                            Arab world and elsewhere as implying approval or tolerance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s policies. We believe that
                            this should be made clearer to the Libyans than it has been in the past,
                            and that the regime should be told that future sales of military
                            matériel under U.S. license will be considered on a case by case basis
                            in the light of progress toward a peaceful settlement in the Middle
                            East. The Libyans must not be allowed to entertain the illusion that
                            they can make end runs around the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            with the help of various arms sellers and the indirect exertion of
                            commercial pressure.</p>
                        <p>In our view, little purpose is served now by keeping the Libyans on the
                            hook in such matters as the delivery of the eight C–130’s they have
                            bought and which are awaiting an export license in the U.S., and it
                            would be better to do away with this contentious issue once and for
                            all.</p>
                        <p>4. III. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and the
                            Soviets</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s relations with the
                            Soviet Union are based on the willingness of the Soviets to sell him
                            arms. They are essentially relations of expedience and convenience on
                            the Libyan and, we presume, on the <pb n="117" facs="0144"
                                xml:id="pg_117"/>Soviet side. We cannot compete with the Soviets in
                            selling Libya arms. Nor can we compete with the Soviets in the
                            acquisition of influence in Libya through covert and subversive means,
                            and we should not try.</p>
                        <p>In the long term several factors are working in our favor. One is that,
                            the closer the regime gets to the Soviets, the more it needs a balancing
                            U.S. presence. We should be alert to seize the opportunities this
                            situation may present us with in the future. Another is that the Libyans
                            are extremely jealous of their political independence, and will not sell
                            it cheap. The modern history of the region which is now called Libya is
                            one of resistance to foreign intruders. Although the Soviets are walking
                            on very soft feet at the moment, the history of their dealings with
                            other Arab states suggests that it will not be long before a reaction
                            against their presence will set in.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in the Embassy’s view, the principal danger for U.S. interests of a
                            Soviet military presence in Libya lies in the fact that it strengthens
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s hand in his efforts
                            to undermine movement toward a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli
                            dispute. We believe that the regime’s basic anti-communist orientation
                            has not changed, and that it is not likely to change as long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is in power.</p>
                        <p>5. IV. Economic and Cultural Relations</p>
                        <p>A. We should try to move our contacts with the Libyans away from the area
                            of military sales to that of economic and cultural relations, although
                            even here we face serious obstacles. During 1974 our sales of goods and
                            services to Libya remained at about the same level in terms of constant
                            dollars, but fell as a proportion of total Libyan spending which rose
                            dramatically as a result of increased oil revenues. In 1975–76 the
                            projected sale of Boeing of three 727’s and a VIP-equipped 707 should
                            improve the picture. Our business people should be aware, however, in
                            trading with Libya that the regime finds itself in a financial squeeze
                            at the moment which may mean that payment for goods and services will be
                            delayed.</p>
                        <p>B. A bright spot in the picture is the Libyan desire to educate large
                            numbers of their young men in the U.S. Over 1500 government-supported
                            students have already been sent, according to our latest reckoning, an
                            increase of 50 percent over last year’s total, and the flow shows no
                            sign of slowing down. We should not try to make political capital out of
                            this; the facts speak for themselves, and as a tactical matter we should
                            keep our satisfaction to ourselves. At the same time, we should work
                            hard to minimize any frictions the program may create, and do our best
                            to smooth over the problems which may arise. If necessary, we should be
                            ready to go out of our way to reassure the suspicious regime that its
                            students will not be discriminated against or propagandized in any way.
                            In particular, Libyan students should not be questioned by U.S. law
                            enforcement agencies unless there is good <pb n="118" facs="0145"
                                xml:id="pg_118"/>reason to believe that they are involved in illegal
                            activity. Under no circumstances should they be questioned about the
                            political situation in Libya.</p>

                        <p>There is increasing evidence that the unnatural alliance between the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Libya must be taken
                            seriously as a threat to the objectives of the United States in the
                            Middle East and to moderate Arab Governments. Although reports on
                            amounts appear to be exaggerated, the recent Soviet decision to give
                            Qhadafi its blessing and supply large additional quantities of advanced
                            weapons and a nuclear reactor appears clearly designed to increase the
                            pressure on Arab moderates to move away from the United States and back
                            toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. At the same time
                            Libya has stepped up its active support of extremist groups and
                            governments trying to undermine if not actually overthrow <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, Asad and the Saudi leadership in
                            order to increase Libya’s influence and derail efforts to bring about
                            peace in the Middle East. The long-term effectiveness of Qhadafi’s
                            efforts is difficult to judge but his determination has not slackened
                            and his disruptive actions appear to be better focussed and potentially
                            more dangerous than in the past. Cooperation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, on the one hand, and
                            battle-hardened “reactionists” like Habash, on the other, enhances
                            Libya’s ability to apply leverage to the more moderate Arab Governments
                            and the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Thus far, Qhadafi has apparently not created major internal problems for
                            the Egyptian, Syrian, Tunisian or Saudi regimes, yet all four
                            governments feel that their stability and security are threatened to
                            some degree by his unique mixture of religious and political fanaticism.
                            Their ability to pursue a reasonable policy toward a Middle East
                            settlement is also hampered, in varying degrees, by Libya’s hard line
                            propaganda and political agitation. This agitation has caused serious
                            complications for certain operations being undertaken by the moderates
                            in an intra-Arab context: most notably in Lebanon where Libyan-backed
                            radicals (Lebanese as well as Palestinian) with the aid of Libyan <pb
                                n="120" facs="0147" xml:id="pg_120"/>agents and of Libyan money were
                            primarily responsible for the fierceness of the armed opposition to
                            Lebanese, Egyptian, Saudi and Syrian efforts to restore calm and install
                            a new government; and in South Yemen where Libya has stepped up its
                            supply of arms and money to the Aden regime, thereby encouraging the

                            from Saudi Arabia and Egypt to cease such subversion, drop all Communist
                            ministers and adopt a moderate philosophy. Libya also continues to stir
                            up trouble on a lesser scale in a number of other places, stretching
                            from Northern Ireland to the Philippines, including support for Eritrean
                            rebels.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s anger at and fear of
                            Qhadafi has become so great that [<hi rend="italic">1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] We know that Saudi Arabia, Iran and even China
                            are also seriously worried by Libya’s unsettling impact on the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Recent events in Lebanon have revealed the strong bond which has been
                            forged between Libya and the Palestinian “rejectionist” groups (<gloss
                                target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss> of Habash, PDFLP of Hawatmeh, <gloss
                                target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss>/GD of Gibril) as well as the growing
                            strength of the latter relative to Arafat’s <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> which follows a less radical approach. The
                            “rejectionists” still enjoy Iraqi, as well as Libyan, support and are
                            determined to overthrow or otherwise eliminate Arafat and other <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> leaders who are considered too “soft”
                            toward Israel. Libya has cut off its funds to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> (it had previously supplied about 1/3
                            of the budget) and is channelling tens of millions of dollars to the
                            “rejectionists.” There are reports that the latter have been involved in
                            bombings and other actions against the Asad regime in Damascus, as well
                            as working against Syrian, Egyptian and Saudi interests in Lebanon and
                            elsewhere. Reacting to this, Egypt has warned them that it will
                            retaliate for “any terrorist action” against Egypt or Egyptian
                            personnel, wherever they may be.</p>
                        <p>At present the rejectionists can still be neutralized, although not
                            eliminated, by the combined efforts of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> and the three Arab Governments. However, should Syria
                            switch from a moderate to a radical mode, the combined strength of Saiqa
                            and the “rejectionists” would probably be enough to capture virtually
                            all of the Palestinians, including Arafat. (One should not underestimate
                            the intelligence, experience and determination of “rejectionist” leaders
                            like Habash, Hawatmah, and Gibril, nor of their potential allies within
                            the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> like Salah Khalaf, the head of
                            Black September.) Such a development could have serious negative effects
                            on our peace efforts, since it would open the way to intensive guerrilla
                            action against Israel from Lebanon, to an upsurge in international
                            terrorism, and to stepped-up subversive and other action against
                            moderate Arab regimes and leaders. The corrosive effects of combined
                            Libyan-rejectionist pressures are evident in the re<pb n="121"

                            as well as to Israeli intransigence on the Palestinian issue.</p>

                            Relations</p>
                        <p>The Soviet-Libyan relationship is a complex one, described in detail in
                            the attached study which the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            prepared at our request. The relationship is underpinned by several arms
                            agreements. The magnitude of the most recent agreement—although greatly
                            exaggerated in most accounts—raises the broader question of whether
                            Moscow will gain a new strategic foothold along the Mediterranean. Even
                            if the scope of deals is less [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] a major expansion of the military relationship
                            between Tripoli and Moscow appears to have taken place, involving later
                            model jet fighters and bombers, submarines, late-model tanks, and large
                            numbers of missiles. The total value is upwards of a billion
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>Political considerations—particularly Moscow’s deteriorating relationship
                            with Egypt—are almost certainly the main reason behind Kosygin’s recent
                            visit to Tripoli and Soviet willingness to provide more arms to Libya,
                            but the opportunity to earn substantial amounts of Libyan oil money
                            probably also plays a part. The Soviets want to sharpen President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s awareness that they
                            have alternatives to Egypt in the Middle East and they expect to gain an
                            element of leverage on him by dealing with his antagonists in Tripoli.
                            Libyan activities in Aden clearly serve Soviet interests—yet the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is not forced to take a position of
                            open opposition to Saudi Arabia. The same is true of the “rejectionists”
                            Palestinians, where Libya provides a conduit for Soviet arms and a
                            degree of Soviet influence in the extremist camp while enabling the
                            Soviets to claim that it continues to support the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, that it is not unhappy with Asad, and
                            that it still wants a peaceful settlement based on Security Council
                            Resolutions 242 and 338. The overall effect of this Soviet strategy is
                            to increase the pressures on the U.S. to abandon its present approach to
                            the Middle East in favor of joint action with the <gloss

                        <p>As part of the arms deals, the Soviets also appear to have won some
                            concessions from Tripoli regarding access to Libyan port facilities.
                            Tripoli apparently has decided to permit Moscow occasional port calls
                            for bunkering and replenishment under tight Libyan controls. The Libyans
                            also may be dangling the prospect of greater concessions, such as base
                            rights, to gain Soviet help in building up Libyan naval facilities at
                            Tobruk.</p>
                        <p>The reported Soviet decision to supply Libya with submarines as part of

                            Soviet control over the use and disposition of all types of armament
                            delivered to Libya. Thus far, there is no evidence of Soviet concern
                            over this problem.</p>
                        <p>Qhadafi also has an obsessive commitment to increase his power by the
                            acquisition of a nuclear weapon capability. Libya has over the past year
                            feverishly explored all possible sources (<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>, Soviet, Chinese, Western European, Indian and
                            Pakistani) and reportedly is negotiating at present with France for an
                            accelerator. It has already concluded in 1974 an agreement with Belgian
                            and Swedish firms for a nuclear research center and apparently made a
                            deal last month with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for an
                            experimental nuclear reactor. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            has made light of our concern over the danger of helping Libya acquire a
                            nuclear capability, stressing that its reactor would be under IEA
                            safeguards and that it has ratified the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                                >NPT</gloss>. Moreover, Libya is estimated to be technologically
                            7–10 years away from a nuclear capability, even with its foreign
                            technicians (mostly Pakistani). Nevertheless, the combination of nuclear
                            technology and Qhadafi’s fanaticism is disturbing for the future.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What to do about the Libyan Threat</p>
                        <p>Given the situation outlined above the obvious question is what can and
                            should the United States do about it. Our present approach to Libya is
                            essentially passive, withholding military equipment and nuclear
                            technology and holding diplomatic representation to the Chargé level. It
                            might be in our best interest to move to a more active approach.
                            However, such a decision should be based on a more precise evaluation of
                            the degree of threat Libya poses to our interests in the Middle East and
                            to the moderate Arab Governments with whom we are cooperating.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore recommend that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1"
                                >Colby</persName> be asked to conduct a high-priority intelligence
                            community study on the seriousness of the Libyan threat. It might also
                            be useful to have the appropriate body look into what actions would
                            theoretically be open to us should a decision be made, in light of the
                            study to move to a more active defensive approach toward Libya.</p>

                                >Eilts</persName> for your approval requesting him to discuss matter
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and inquire whether
                            GOE would object to our authorizing Northrop to proceed with project at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text: On June 26, 1974, after ascertaining that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had no objection, Department
                            approved request by Northrop-Page to enter into contract with <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> for sale of $200 million air defense
                            system. This would comprise fixed radar network and information handling
                            equipment without arms. At that time we gave Northrop letter stating
                            Department approved proposed contractual relationship and expressing
                            intention to issue licenses for export of items necessary to carry out
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>3. After year of negotiations between Northrop and <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>, during which Libyans unsuccessfully
                            tried to link signing of contract with Northrop to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s release of the eight <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>-owned C–130s, for which we are
                            withholding export licenses, <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>, on
                            June 24, 1975, concluded contract with firm for first phase of air
                            defense system in amount of $16 million. Northrop plans to bid on second
                            and third phases and believes <pb n="124" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_124"
                            />it has good chance to win larger contracts if Libyans satisfied with
                            its performance on first phase.</p>
                        <p>4. Since June 1974, there has been serious deterioration in
                            Libyan-Egyptian relations and intensification of <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss>’s militant opposition to Middle East
                            peace efforts. <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> also concluded
                            arms deal with Soviets about which GOE has expressed apprehension.</p>
                        <p>5. Under munitions control regulations, Department has firm legal grounds
                            to withhold approval of contract on basis overriding national interest.
                            However, this will bring complaints of bad faith from Northrop and
                            criticism from members of Congress whose constituents affected by loss
                            of profits and jobs. Northrop also may be liable to <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> for nonperformance.</p>
                        <p>6. Before deciding whether or not to withdraw authorization for Northrop
                            to proceed with project, I wish to solicit President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>7. Action requested: You should seek to ascertain <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s views, using following talking
                            points (if you are able to do so before you leave, we could discuss this
                            in Belgrade):</p>
                        <p>—Northrop-Page has informed Department that it signed contract with
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> on June 24 to furnish first
                            phase of air defense system to Libya.</p>
                        <p>—This is first portion of the same project on which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> sought your views in June
                            1974 and which you advised us at that time to go ahead on. If we approve
                            this contract, and if <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> is
                            satisfied with Northrop’s performance, firm has good chance of receiving
                            contracts for rest of system within next 12 to 18 months.</p>
                        <p>—System in question would be a fixed network of radar and information
                            handling equipment, would be strictly defensive and would include no rpt
                            no arms.</p>
                        <p>—Given Libyan behavior in recent months, we are inclined to withdraw our
                            approval of this sale, but before making decision on whether or not to
                            allow Northrop to furnish this system to Libya, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wanted me to discuss it with
                            you. We will welcome any comments you may have about the advisability of
                            allowing Northrop-Page to proceed with the sale in question at this
                            time. End text.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>. If <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> recommends approval, and we decide to approve
                            sale, this would lead <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> to
                            expect approval for similar proposal for Egypt. In latter connection,
                            you should know that ITT has formally requested munitions control
                            license to demonstrate a concept proposal for nonlethal components of
                            air defense system for Egypt.</p>
                        <p>9. Recommendation: That you approve the above.</p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                        <p>10. For Cairo: You should hold off action until Secretary’s approval
                            received.</p>
                        <p>11. For S/S: Please ensure a copy of response is sent to Cairo.</p>

                        <p>1. Upon receipt <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> A, I prepared
                            a message setting forth my view that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> might be expected to oppose sale of Northrop-Page

                            a sale. Circumstances of June, 1974 are different from those that now
                            obtain. Relations between <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> are currently so bad
                            that anything <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> does, directly or

                            and therefore dropped it.</p>
                        <p>2. I have been in touch with <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>

                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had approved sale in June, 1974,
                            but expressed concern that we should now go through with it. He hoped
                            there was some way of calling it off. He was sure this would also be
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s view, but undertook
                            to check. Gen <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> called back

                        <p>1. Chargé and <gloss target="#t_PolOff_1">PolOff</gloss> talked August 18
                            with Ambassador Shaaban, Director of North American Affairs at <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>, and conveyed U.S. position on

                                target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. In reply, Shaaban said it appeared that efforts to improve relations
                            were one-sided, and that the more Libya did to improve relations, the
                            more the U.S. rebuffed Libya’s advances. Shaaban said that when Country
                            Officer Jameson was here he had been treated with special consideration,
                            the Ministry had organized a program for his visit, and he had been
                            taken to meet the Ministry’s Acting Undersecretary at the time,
                            Al-Atrash. This was all evidence of Libya’s keen desire to improve
                            relations. Shaaban said he had hoped that there would be some positive
                            response to this from the U.S., but instead the opposite had happened,
                            and with the Northrop-Page reversal a new obstacle had been placed in
                            the path of an improvement in relations. Shaaban pointed out that there
                            had been no response to Libya’s nomination of an Ambassador to the U.S.,
                            and no reciprocal step to Libya’s removal of restrictions on the size of
                            Embassy Tripoli. It was beginning to appear to him that the U.S. did not
                            share Libya’s desire to improve relations. And what about the
                            C–130’s?</p>
                        <p>3. In response, Chargé reaffirmed our readiness to continue and expand
                            cultural and economic relations. It was only in the military sphere that
                            we felt we could not cooperate, as a result of Libya’s active opposition
                            to our Mideast peace efforts.</p>

                        <p>4. Shaaban replied that as the U.S. was always saying, our overall
                            relations were the important thing. Cultural and commercial relations
                            were very well, and Libya welcomed them, but they were not enough if
                            they were not accompanied by strong political ties. We surely knew what
                            importance Libya attached to its army. In the absence of an improvement
                            in official relations, commercial and cultural ties might suffer. The
                            world was a big place, Libya had good relations with France, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and other countries. Libyan
                            students could be educated elsewhere, and Libya could satisfy its
                            commercial requirements elsewhere if necessary. We must understand that
                            Libya’s desire to improve relations was sincere. It was not just talk.
                            Libya knew there were many problems, and that the road would be long,
                            but had hoped to see some concrete actions from the U.S. which would
                            make it possible to keep moving. If the U.S. were serious about
                            improving relations, the Dept would do well to reconsider its decision
                            on Northrop-Page. Had we not noticed that the press had been more
                            restrained in its treatment of the U.S. lately, and in particular that
                            there had been no reference to the Mideast negotiations for the last
                            week?</p>
                        <p>5. We asked whether we would be misleading our govt if we reported that
                            the halt of propaganda attacks on President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> during the last week had been connected with
                            Libya’s desire to improve relations with the U.S., emphasizing that this
                            point was of great importance. After some attempt to avoid a direct
                            answer, Shaaban admitted that he could not say for certain what the
                            cause of the stopping of the anti-<persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>/campaign had been. Perhaps the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> had given an unofficial directive to
                            this effect. Sometimes this happened when there were sensitive
                            diplomatic conversations taking place. In any case, we could be sure
                            that if Libyan-American relations improved, the press would not rpt not
                            be a problem. The press sometimes made mistakes, and said one thing when
                            it meant another, but it could be controlled, and it would naturally
                            reflect the level of relations in its commentaries.</p>

                            Cairo 5640 of 5 June 1975.</p>
                        <p>1. Department has decided to lift restrictions on size Libyan Mission in
                            Washington and will deliver following note to Embassy here on January 8:
                            Quote: The Department of State refers to the note of September 2, 1975
                            from the Embassy of the Libyan Arab Republic officially conveying the
                            decision of the Libyan Arab Republic to lift the restriction on the
                            number of U.S. diplomatic staff assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.
                            The Government of the United States, on the basis of reciprocity, has
                            decided to lift the restriction on the size of the diplomatic staff
                            working at the Embassy of the Libyan Arab Republic in Washington. This
                            information is also being conveyed through the United States Chargé
                            d’Affaires in Tripoli to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Unquote.</p>
                        <p>2. This responds to one of several Libyan démarches made in 1975 in name
                            of “improved” relations. Dept. does not plan to respond to other
                            outstanding requests (e.g., release of C–130s or agrément of Libyan
                            Ambassador) given continued active opposition of <gloss

                            negotiated settlement in Middle East. This decision to remove ceiling on
                            Libyan Mission personnel in Washington is based on <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> desire to improve working level
                            communications in such matters as consular and commercial services, and
                            is in reciprocity for earlier Libyan removal of ceiling on U.S.
                            diplomatic personnel in Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>3. Embassy Tripoli should inform <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss>
                            orally of Department decision conveyed by diplomatic note to its mission
                            here.</p>
                        <p>4. For Cairo: While you should not volunteer this information to GOE, if
                            asked you should assure Egyptians that action was simple reciprocal
                            gesture in response to similar action by Libyans, will help alleviate
                            Libyan Embassy’s consular workload (which is also in <gloss

                            significance. We have not granted agrément for a Libyan Ambassador and
                            have no intention of raising level of official U.S.—Libyan relations at

                        <p>The Embassy of the Libyan Arab Republic presents its compliments to the
                            Department of State and has the honor to request complete details
                            concerning commissions and bribes paid to Libyans and non-Libyans in
                            connection with the deal of C–130’s bought by the Libyan Arab Republic
                            from Lockheed, as detailed in the report prepared by the Congressional

                        <p>Also, requested, assurances that the C–130’s to be delivered to Egypt are
                            not from the Libyan C–130’s.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy of the Libyan Arab Republic considers this request as of
                            great urgency and importance, and thus would very much appreciate a
                            prompt reply.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy of the Libyan Arab Republic avails itself of this opportunity
                            to renew to the Department of State the assurances of its highest

                        <p>End text.</p>
                        <p>2. Dept replied that requests would be considered and official response
                            would be forthcoming. On the surface, however, it would appear that
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> need not fear that its

                        <p>3. DeptOff took opportunity to refer to series of speeches being made by
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> which contained
                            highly derogatory refer<pb n="130" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_130"/>ences to

                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: Dept has not yet decided how to

                            information. At Department’s request Justice is assisting responsible

                            to obtain information relevant to ongoing investigations in those
                            countries. In such cases, formal judicial assistance agreement has been
                            negotiated between Justice and its counterparts. One condition in
                            agreements is that any information supplied by Justice be kept
                            confidential until such time as recipient government concludes its
                            investigation and decides use of information essential to law
                            enforcement proceeding. Justice, however, has declined to screen raw

                            the Libyan Arab Republic in Washington which requested information and

                            Lockheed which are the subject of export license application numbers
                            94113 and 94114 (Lockheed contract numbers GLX–221 of September 13,
                            1972, and GLX–230 of November 27, 1972) belong solely to the Libyan Arab

                            but that it actively opposes and seeks to undermine our efforts towards

                            give support and refuge to terrorists. In absence of conducive
                            atmosphere we cannot take certain measures. Should we see significant

                            other states <pb n="135" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_135"/>friendly to Egypt,
                            and his use of terrorism inside Egypt have now convinced <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> is not a “harmless clown” but a dangerous
                            “lunatic” and that he must be eliminated. The most striking public
                            indicators of this change in <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s attitude are the massing of some 10,000 troops
                            on Libya’s border and an unrestrained anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> (but not anti-Libyan) media campaign. An
                            examination of Egyptian options leads us to believe that some direct GOE
                            action may take place when a propitious moment presents itself. The most
                            effective option would be to engineer <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s assassination or an <gloss target="#t_RCC_1"
                                >RCC</gloss> coup since, in GOE view, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> enjoys little military or popular support. If
                            GOE’s intelligence assets inside Libya do not make this possible, we
                            think direct military action would be considered, in response to next
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> outrage, real or
                            manufactured. This would be an agonizing decision for <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and he would have to be assured
                            that Soviets would not react militarily and that he had full backing of
                            his officer corps. If he decided to move militarily, we think he would
                            do so massively in order to avoid getting entrapped in a prolonged
                            conflict a la Yemen or Lebanon. Other possible options probably being
                            considered that could be employed alone or in conjunction with direct
                            military attack or subversion probably include setting up of Libyan
                            Government-in-exile and an even more strident propaganda campaign. Saudi
                            support for direct action has been or would be sought before <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> decides on a course of action. He
                            might also wish <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> assurance that it
                            would act to counter possible Soviet reaction. On other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> probably believes elimination of
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would be widely
                            approved both in West and among most states in region. End Summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Progressive deterioration of GOE-Libyan relations since about January
                            1976 has reached point where GOE policy makers may be contemplating
                            action to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. In
                            this cable, we examine reasons for this change in GOE’s heretofore
                            relatively tolerant policy toward <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>; review Egyptian capabilities and options; and
                            attempt to assess GOE intentions.</p>
                        <p>2. Change in GOE thinking, since the October War, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> has written off <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> as irrevocably hostile to any
                            constructive approach to <gloss target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss> peace
                            settlement. When assassination squads targeted on GOE notables were
                            first dispatched from Tripoli last summer, GOE concluded <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had also become an irrevocable
                            and potentially dangerous enemy of the <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> regime. Nevertheless, until early 1976, we do not
                            believe there was any GOE plan to oust him. If there was, it proceeded
                            at a leisurely pace. The reasons for this relatively relaxed GOE
                            attitude were, we believe, as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was not perceived as a
                            potent threat either to Egypt’s foreign policy or domestic security. He
                            was a “clown.”</p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="0163" xml:id="pg_136"/>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> valued his reputation as
                            a non-interferer in Arab domestic affairs, a reputation he has
                            painstakingly fostered and which he believes made the October War Arab
                            alliance possible. Nasser’s interventionist tactics, now proudly
                            inherited by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, are,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> believed, strategically
                            counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>C. Egyptian intelligence until recently (Tripoli 992) assessed <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s situation internally and
                            externally as bad, but believed civilian opposition powerless and
                            military dissidents closely and effectively surveilled. Probability of a
                            genuine internal coup was consequently remote.</p>
                        <p>3. In last few months, however, we have been told at high levels that
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> must go, and that GOE
                            “will get him.” There are supporting indications that Egyptian planning
                            to speed his ouster are being accelerated. Several reasons for this
                            change in GOE thinking can be adduced:</p>
                        <p>A. Bolder Libyan Subversion. While August 8 bomb attack in Cairo was only
                            latest in series of Libyan terrorist actions and assassination plots,
                            fact that it took place in central Cairo and was clearly directed at
                            Egyptians rather than Libyan exiles have caused outpouring of public and
                            official indignation (<persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            expressed his personal anger in no uncertain terms to Ambassador August
                            10). Suddenly, GOE is faced with apparently bolder Libyan terrorism of a
                            kind which is notoriously difficult to prevent. <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> is now seen to be concrete threat to
                            Egyptian national security. The “clown” is now seen as a dangerous
                            “lunatic.”</p>
                        <p>B. Subversion in Sudan. GOE officials, including <persName

                            is not capable of having mounted such a well-organized and logistically
                            complicated coup attempt. They strongly suspect Soviet involvement, at
                            minimum in the planning, and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> said as much in Egypt’s August 11 message to Arab
                            League members (Cairo 10844). Furthermore, in Egyptian eyes, coup
                            attempt was directed as much at Egypt as Sudan, given <persName

                            entente, reflect seriousness of GOE concern. Egyptians have stressed to

                            troubled GOE and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> has said
                            publicly that rumored $12 billion worth of Soviet arms for Libya far

                            has stated privately that the one condition that would prompt Egypt to
                            move militarily against Libya would be establishment of Soviet base
                            there (Cairo 6411). Continuing arms deliveries, belief that Soviets were
                            involved in Sudan coup attempt, and, most importantly, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s conviction that Soviets’
                            ultimate objective is to oust him have given greater immediacy to GOE
                            concern as evidenced by Egyptian military concentrations on the western
                            border over past six weeks.</p>
                        <p>E. The time is right—the GOE has for some time been in touch with <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members inside and outside of Libya.
                            Two of them, Muhayshi and <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1"
                                >Al-Huni</persName>, have, in fact, been given asylum in Cairo.
                            Utilizing their assets in Libya, mainly the large number of Egyptian
                            nationals employed there, GOE has tried to keep close tabs on <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s popularity. It has sought,
                            through its propaganda machine and broadcasts by former <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> member Muhayshi, further to discredit
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. Rightly or wrongly,
                            it is persuaded that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            position has been seriously eroded and that most of his significant
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> colleagues (except Jallud)
                            oppose him. If something is to be done about <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, the GOE may well have concluded that this is
                            the time to do so.</p>
                        <p>4. GOE has detailed evidence of Libyan hand in Sudan affair and Cairo
                            bomb attack and has exploited these incidents to stir up public
                            indignation to new pitch. Editorial writers, acting under high-level
                            guidance, have for first time said that Egyptian patience is exhausted
                            and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> must go. Only note of
                            restraint in press campaign is that Egypt will not resort to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s methods in order to spare
                            Libyan people (Cairo 10651). All writers have made clear distinction
                            between “lunatic ruler” and Libyan people. Anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> campaign has reached stage
                            where public now expects some counter action, and majority of Egyptians
                            almost certainly feel it justified and even necessary in Egypt’s own
                            interest. In fact, if GOE fails to take some action to curtail <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, it risks a lessening of
                            confidence and respect among its own people, as well as others in Arab
                            world (an Arab “paper tiger”).</p>
                        <p>5. Egyptian Capabilities.</p>
                        <p>A. Military. Senior Egyptian officials scoff at indigenous Libyan
                            military capabilities, but are aware of Soviet, Yugoslav, Bulgarian and
                            Pakistani advisors. Egypt has recently established a western area
                            command at Mursa Matruh. Forces under this command are 2–3 brigades of
                            armor and mechanized forces, some commando forces, air defense forces
                            including SAM–2, SAM–3, and SAM–6 air defense units, two squadrons of
                            MIG–21s, MI–8 helo detachment and an engineer group. The total force now
                            located in the Egyptian western desert is probably in excess of 10,000
                            troops. This force is much stronger than required to defend against any
                            type of military action from Libya. It is clearly strong enough to make
                            a demonstration in force or execute a limited type of attack into Libya.
                            However, with reinforcement from the armor <pb n="138" facs="0165"
                                xml:id="pg_138"/>divisions of additional tanks and APCs and the
                            necessary logistical train, we estimate the force could cross the desert
                            to Tripoli in five days, provided Libya obtains no significant outside
                            support and Egyptians don’t stop to engage in major battles. The most
                            serious opposition would probably be from the air force attacking the
                            Egyptian columns; and near Tripoli it might be expected that the Libyans
                            would establish a series of defensive positions. Presumably the
                            Egyptians, should they elect to attack Tripoli, would start the attack
                            with a major air strike thereby knocking out much of the Libyan Air
                            Force. Under optimum conditions, we believe a military victory could be
                            achieved in about seven days by a determined armor attack to the west
                            supported by airborne commando and/or amphibious forces landing in
                            Tripoli area.</p>
                        <p>B. Subversive. Egyptian civilian security officials claim to have few
                            assets inside Libya to use against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> personally, given tight security and loyal
                            troops with which he surrounds himself. However, GOE military
                            intelligence must have extensive information on Libyan officers, many of
                            whom they trained, and presumably maintained contact with some of them.
                            Nature of GOE contact with Libyan military is not known by us, but if it
                            is sufficient to mount an assassination attempt or an internal military
                            coup against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, this would
                            appear to be most attractive option with least risk. While there are
                            still an estimated 250,000 Egyptians in Libya, they are mainly workers
                            and at best can be used for some intelligence gathering. Egypt has the
                            capability to mount commando-type raids on Libyan installations or to
                            engage in bomb attacks, but since these would not get at <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> personally—and would risk
                            strengthening him with Libyan people—they are unlikely to be effective.
                            Furthermore, any such subversive actions would require a reversal of a
                            major tenet of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s Arab
                            policy, which has been based on achievement of Arab unity against Israel
                            through persuasion and non-interference in other’s internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>C. Political. Libyan exiles in Egypt, notably former <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members Umar Muhayshi and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Abdul Munim al-Huni</persName>, provide
                            potential leaders for an anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> political movement around which a
                            government-in-exile could be created to operate either from Egypt or put
                            into place quickly in Libya. GOE is convinced there are many
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> military and
                            civilian elements in Libya that would rally around such an
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> movement if it
                            had a chance of success. GOE could also step up full scale
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> propaganda
                            campaign in the media and open one in international organizations.
                            However, such Egyptian campaigns (e.g., Lebanon) have been markedly
                            unsuccessful by themselves. We would, however, expect such a campaign to
                            precede more substantial actions that may be contemplated. We could
                            already be witnessing the beginning of this campaign.</p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_139"/>
                        <p>6. Options.</p>
                        <p>A. Military. Even with current forces in the western desert, Egypt has a
                            valid military option. Barring outside intervention, it could, with
                            reinforcements, successfully mount a full scale attack as far as Tripoli
                            under favorable conditions. Favorable conditions would include minimal
                            Libyan Army resistance, which might result if Libyans convinced sole
                            purpose of invasion would be to replace <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> with a new Libyan Government. However, unless
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> supplies GOE with
                            plausible justification for massive military action (which Egyptians
                            might try to provoke), it is difficult to envisage Egypt undertaking
                            overt aggression. A factor favoring the military option is that the
                            military forces of likely <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            supporters are fully engaged elsewhere (Algeria with Morocco, Syria with
                            Iraq in Lebanon and with each other). Libya, it would appear, could
                            count on little concrete military support from radical Arabs who
                            perceive that their own regimes would be endangered by <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s disappearance. There are at
                            least two major factors which argue against the strictly military
                            option: reaction of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            attitude of Egyptian military.</p>
                        <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. With its dwindling assets in
                            the Arab world, Soviets have attempted to exploit relationship with
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> for their own designs
                            and we assume they would do everything feasible to assist <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> in international forums and
                            with propaganda. Egyptians, however, seem to believe Soviets would not
                            react militarily. The presence of approximately 500 Soviet military
                            technicians in Libya who could be caught up in fighting is something GOE
                            must consider. At minimum, we would expect GOE to feel out <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> about our reaction before taking direct
                            military action that risks a Soviet military reaction.</p>
                        <p>(2) Attitude of Egyptian Military. Given the suspected degradation of
                            Egypt’s military preparedness and unanimous belief that Egypt’s
                            principal enemy is Israel, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            would want to be very certain that any military action had full backing
                            of his officer corps. We have already received one report of a few
                            officers grumbling over being stationed on western as opposed to eastern
                            front. Current anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> press
                            campaign could well be aimed at convincing military (as well as public)
                            that adequate justification already exists. The stridency of GOE
                            reaction to future <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            actions should be an important indicator of GOE intentions. Until very
                            recently, GOE has maintained that its troop concentrations in the west
                            are strictly for defensive purposes in response to confirmed Libyan
                            build up near border. However, lead story in Cairo’s major daily August
                            13, reporting reinforcement of Egyptian forces on the western and
                            northwestern border, goes further. Troops are there “to protect Egypt’s
                            border and prevent saboteurs from infiltrating,” but military spokesman
                            warned Egypt will prepare for whatever measures necessary to protect

                                facs="0167" xml:id="pg_140"/>Libyan people.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was alleged to be recruiting
                            and training saboteurs in number of bases near the border. “Experts from
                            a big power” (read Soviets) have been planning these operations and
                            providing arms. Number of Libyan leaders allegedly “reject” <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> policy. This is first public
                            hint that Egyptian forces have a responsibility to protect Libyans from
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> (and by implication
                            from Soviets). <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> interview
                            with Kuwaiti <hi rend="italic">Al-Siyasa</hi> published August 14 quotes
                            him as saying “<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> will not
                            escape from my hand.” (Septel)</p>
                        <p>B. Limited Military Action. In reaction to a Libyan border incursion,
                            real or manufactured, GOE could undertake limited military action by
                            seizing a part of eastern Libya. This would enable it to test the
                            reaction of the Libyan Army and people, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, and its own forces. If, as GOE would hope, it led to
                            weakening of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> through army
                            desertions or popular demonstrations, and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> could somehow be checked, then stage would be set for
                            examination of further options. This option entails limited military
                            risk, but danger of long drawn out involvement without decisive result
                            during which radical Arab and international opinion would be brought to
                            bear on Egypt. Given result of Syria’s partial intervention in Lebanon,
                            it unlikely to be attractive to GOE.</p>
                        <p>Another possibility is an airborne raid on Tripoli of brigade size
                            designed to destroy <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and
                            his government and avoiding possible large scale battle on the border.
                            This would, however, probably require neutralization of air defenses
                            along the route and assumes relatively light opposition in Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>C. Political Option. GOE could set up government-in-exile headed by
                            Muhayshi and <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Al-Huni</persName> and launch
                            full scale propaganda campaign, combined with flow of Saudi funds to
                            potential dissidents inside Libya, to encourage Libyan Army to move.
                            There is reason to believe that formation of government-in-exile was
                            contemplated by Egypt last May but was rejected (Cairo 7652), probably
                            because it was thought premature and would alert <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to take draconian action
                            against potential dissidents. Now, however, GOE may believe time is ripe
                            for government-in-exile. This option would entail least risk of all, but
                            alone we think it unlikely to be effective against a regime such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s and GOE has
                            probably come to same conclusion.</p>
                        <p>D. Combined Military-Political Option. GOE could seize a portion of
                            Libyan territory in reaction to next <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> outrage and remain in territory long enough to
                            test reaction inside Libya. At same time it could move
                            government-in-exile to Libyan territory and set it up as rallying point
                            for anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> forces. While
                            such a move contains greater risk of failure and accusations from
                            numerous quarters of direct interference in Libya’s internal affairs, it
                            has the attraction of encouraging a Libyan movement with military force
                            to demonstrate its seriousness. <pb n="141" facs="0168" xml:id="pg_141"
                            />Unless it succeeds in toppling <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> in first few days, however, it carries same
                            danger of long involvement without decisive results.</p>
                        <p>E. Subversion. Since GOE’s target is <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> and not Libyan people, nor even the army or
                            security forces, subversive activities such as bombings and harassment
                            could risk strengthening <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            more than weakening him. Furthermore, they would undercut GOE line that
                            clearly separates Libyan people from their “lunatic” ruler. While extent
                            of GOE assets inside Libyan military are questionable, encouragement of
                            assassination or military coup by <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss>
                            members would, if sufficient GOE capability exists, certainly be most
                            painless ways to oust <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. If
                            GOE has such a capability, the question is why hasn’t it made use of it
                            earlier. A coup attempt, coupled with Egyptian military action to give
                            courage and protection to perpetrators, would be an attractive
                            option.</p>
                        <p>7. GOE Intentions. GOE has [for] some time been preparing contingency
                            plans for actions against Libya, but until recently there were few
                            indications that a decision to take direct action was near. Now some of
                            those indications are present, notably the press campaign violently
                            attacking <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and implicating
                            Soviets and the angry reacton of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and senior security officials to the August 8
                            bombings, we believe some GOE move is likely. Although GOE has publicly
                            ignored <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s threat to sever
                            diplomatic relations on September 1, [it] is sending its new Ambassador
                            to Tripoli in the next few days, and People’s Assembly Speaker Sayid
                            Mar’i received new head of Libyan Relations Office Ambassador Aboul
                            Qadir Ghoka August 12. All of these moves could be a ruse to reassure
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> of continuing
                            Egyptian passivity.</p>
                        <p>8. In all options outlined above, we think a key to Egyptian thinking
                            must logically be the removal of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> either by arrest or assassination, preferably by
                            a Libyan with revolutionary credentials. If this were to materialize,
                            GOE thinks <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> would crumble.
                            However, GOE capacity to mount either assassination or military coup is
                            believed to be limited, and, even if it were to happen, it would
                            probably have to be accompanied by Egyptian military-political action.
                            Ideally, Egyptian armed forces would be invited to move in not just by
                            Muhayshi and <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Al-Huni</persName>, but also
                            by dissident <gloss target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> members and army
                            officers now in place in Libya. Alternatively, Egyptians could move
                            quickly to set up Al-Huni-Muhayshi “government” on Libyan territory from
                            which they could appeal for massive Egyptian intervention. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was quickly disposed of, or is
                            outside of Libya, GOE believes that it would face little opposition and
                            a march to Tripoli would be unnecessary. If, however, coup failed, an
                            all out military campaign as far as Tripoli would be required. In any
                            case, we believe that if GOE decides on direct military action (and this
                            is still a big if), it will do so on a massive scale with intention of
                            finishing <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> off within
                            shortest possible time and enabling troops to withdraw quickly to
                            eastern front. Libya will not be<pb n="142" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_142"
                            />come <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s Yemen or Lebanon.
                            A major consideration for any serious anti-Libyan action will be the
                            support of Saudi Arabia. While we know <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> threat has been discussed at highest levels of
                            two governments, we are not privy to their content.</p>
                        <p>9. Ideal timing for Egyptian move would be when <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is abroad since, in GOE view,
                            there would then be little opposition to his removal. However, to best
                            of our knowledge <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> not
                            attending NAC in Colombo and he rarely leaves Libya these days.</p>
                        <p>10. Other options open to GOE are considerably less attractive, because
                            they are unlikely to succeed in the sole objective of Egyptian strategy
                            which is to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>.
                            Formation of a government-in-exile and propaganda campaigns are unlikely
                            alone or together to be effective and limited military action risks
                            international opprobrium and a drawn out involvement on, for the
                            Egyptian military, the wrong front.</p>
                        <p>11. Implications for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. As in past,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is likely to make his
                            decision on the basis of Egypt’s strategic interests. The attraction of
                            a friendly government in Libya and the elimination of Soviet presence
                            there (given <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s perception
                            that it is a threat to him), as well as access to Libyan oil wealth, are
                            powerful incentives pushing <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            toward decisive action. If these goals could be achieved, it would be
                            very much in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests as well as
                            those of Western Europe. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            surely knows this and probably hopes he can count on <gloss

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The evidence of Libyan involvement in several areas of the Middle East
                            and Africa—especially Lebanon, Sudan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Uganda—has
                            increased markedly in recent months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s activities demonstrate a
                            new capability to go beyond isolated subversive or terrorist acts. The
                            scope of Libyan support for Palestinian/leftist forces in Lebanon and
                            the preparation of the coup attempt against <persName corresp="#p_NGM_1"
                                >Numayri</persName> suggest that the Libyan leader is no longer a
                            fringe actor. With considerable wealth and military supplies at his
                            disposal, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is now in a

                            has deteriorated sharply within the past year. He is weak among the

                            Cyrenaica region, the major city of which is Benghazi. In the army there
                            is general agreement that the Libyan patrimony is being spent lavishly
                            in foolish foreign adventures.</p>

                            has given high priority to extending Tripoli’s influence in Africa,
                            propagating the Islamic faith, and promoting revolutionary programs and
                            regimes among Third World countries.</p>

                            agreements with Israel. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            evidently decided in late 1973-early 1974 to build up Libya’s
                            independent subversive and interventionist capabilities. After

                            in the spring of 1974. This equipment, which far exceeds Libya’s needs
                            or capability to maintain or operate, is for use in continuing
                            hostilities with Israel and in support of such “progressive” causes as
                            the Polisario Front and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman. In

                            >Qadhafi</persName>’s leverage in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
                        <p>Since late 1975, Libyan-sponsored operations—long in the works— have
                            demonstrated the seriousness of Libya’s capability to use its large <pb

                            and Africa in fundamental ways. This spring, there was a spate of
                            subversive activity designed against each of Libya’s neighbors (except
                            for Algeria and Mali). In February and March, <persName

                            Egypt, which had been harboring his opponents and broadcasting
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> propaganda. In

                            Tunisian Prime Minister. Also in March and April, the Presidents of
                            Niger and Chad accused <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> of

                        <p>In the past four months, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            has been active in the following areas:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Lebanon</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has supported elements of both Lebanese leftists
                            (Jumblatt and newer groups like the Lebanese Arab Army) and Palestinian
                            groups in Lebanon. He has subsidized those groups whose current
                            activities coincided with his views, and withheld supplies when he was
                            displeased. Libya probably has contributed at least $50 million–$100
                            million to leftist and Palestinian Rejectionist forces in Lebanon in the
                            past year. Until a few months ago, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> funneled the bulk of these supplies through
                            Syria and Asad.</p>
                        <p>During April and May, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was
                            busy trying to build a rejectionist front of Algeria, Libya, Syria, and
                            Iraq (plus the Palestinians), and his Prime Minister, Major Jalloud, was
                            dispatched to whip together the necessary support for opening a “new
                            front” on Israel’s northern border. This dream collapsed when Syria, at
                            odds with Iraq and in the midst of increased fighting against the
                            Palestinians, effectively declined to join the new rejectionist
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Jalloud was once again sent to the area, this time in an attempt to keep
                            the Syrians from emasculating the Palestinian forces and to develop a
                            “cease-fire.” Approximately 200 Libyans were sent to Lebanon as part of
                            the Arab League peacekeeping force. While the evidence is not
                            conclusive, it appears that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> is critical of the role played by Jalloud,
                            claiming that he failed to be firm with the Syrians and needed to push
                            the Palestinian demands harder.</p>
                        <p>Libya has clearly exacerbated the Lebanese crisis by providing money and
                            arms to the leftists/Palestinians, thereby increasing their ability to
                            continue fighting the Syrian/Christian forces. Following the change in
                            Syria’s position, that country could no longer be used to deliver Soviet
                            equipment going to the leftists/Palestinians. In addition to its own
                            support, Libya may have become the conduit for transshipping Moscow’s
                            arms into Lebanon. Since the leftists/Palestinians have other sources of
                            financial and material support, the Libyan input may not <pb n="146"
                                facs="0173" xml:id="pg_146"/>have been a decisive factor in
                            prolonging the war. On the other hand, Libya is the party least likely
                            to abandon the leftists/Palestinians or to put pressure on them to
                            compromise on vital issues, and Libyan support must have played a major
                            role in stiffening their will to resist an accommodation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Sudan</hi>. In early July, a major Libyan-backed coup

                                >Numayri</persName> regime. The Libyans provided arms, money, and
                            coordination to disparate groups totalling several hundred Sudanese
                            exiles and others, who gathered in Libya and Eritrea to prepare for the
                            attack. The effort probably took a year or more to prepare and was an
                            uncharacteristically smooth operation.</p>

                            claims that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has never

                            rallied to the regime. A major factor seems to have been the coup’s

                            Egyptian security found that the saboteur who planted the two bombs was

                            persons and injuring 51. While lacking positive proof, Egyptian
                            officials assume from the type of explosive used that it was a

                            special forces. Egypt insists that the attempt was plotted by Libya and
                            identified the three hijackers as two Palestinians and an Egyptian, all

                            Tunisians being expelled from Libya, as many as 100 who had been
                            recruited and trained by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            in his commando camps. The Libyans were reported to have made contact
                            this spring with the Italian Mafia to assist in anti-Tunisian efforts.
                            In the aftermath of the Sudan coup attempt, the Tunisians’ anxiety rose.
                            Intelligence reports of Libyan plans for a coup attempt against
                            Bourguiba and/or sabotage plans for late July–early August led the
                            Tunisians to seek and receive demonstrations of military support from
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, France, and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>It is doubtful that Libya would mount a military attack on Tunisia while
                            its attention is focused on its border with Egypt. Although a coup
                            attempt cannot be ruled out, it is more likely (and certainly easier)
                            that Libyan efforts will continue to be in the nature of sabotage or
                            terrorism.</p>

                            agreed to supply Uganda with oil, though it would have great difficulty
                            in airlifting even 10 percent of Uganda’s needs—and that over

                            capability, he may have allocated $100 million to Black September and
                            $40 million to other Palestinian groups involved in terrorism, such as
                            the <gloss target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss>. There has been a past
                            pattern of Libyan support for terrorist operations directed at Israeli
                            aircraft and passengers, including the attacks at Athens in August 1973
                            and Rome in December 1973. Although the reports of direct Libyan
                            involvement in the Uganda hijacking in July are not fully confirmed, the

                            networks, as well as the plane’s landing in Libya, strongly indicate
                            that there was Libyan involvement. More recently, the Libyans were
                            apparently involved in the August 11 attempted hijacking of an El Al

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has probably taken

                            operations, such as those the Tunisians have complained of. His use of
                            Libyan commandos in his three kidnap/assassination attempts in March
                            backfired and exposed him to ridicule. Future terrorist
                            missions—especially the hijackings—will probably use the group of
                            international professional terrorists who carried out the operation

                            camps and terrorist/subversive links, he is now able to pull off more
                            ambitious and dangerous operations. His activities during the past

                            cracked down on a conspiracy to unseat him. Only four <gloss

                            desperate foreign adventures. In Lebanon, for example, if the

                            request of President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> that
                            we undertake an aerial photographic mission over Libya to ascertain
                            location of any Soviet naval ships off the Libyan coast, Libyan troop
                            and equipment dispositions in the area of the Libyan/Egyptian and
                            Libyan/Sudanese frontiers and roads leading up to the borders. The
                            President is particularly anxious to have any information on
                            concentrations of tanks, heavy weapons and rockets. If we are able to
                            set up such a mission, the President asks that we provide him with the
                            results as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>3. I recall we once spoke of running an SR–71 mission over the area.
                            Please let me know if we can lay on such a mission and, if so, when, so
                            that I can respond to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s

                            interpreter?</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: No, we can do it in English. I think I can manage. You know we
                            Libyans have a problem with languages. We were colonized by the
                            Italians. I only started English under the British administration.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you speak
                            Italian?</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: I understand it very well. I also speak French—and Arabic, of
                            course.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How were the Italians
                            as colonists?</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Very bad, especially under Mussolini.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Very bad, you say? I
                            did not realize . . .</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Yes, it was a racist regime. They discriminated heavily against
                            Arabs. There were laws that said no Arab could marry an Italian, and so
                            on. There were two classes of citizens—national and the indigenous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And the indigenous
                            were the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Yes, and all the laws were written in terms of indigenous and
                            national people. It is for that reason that we joined the 8th Army and
                            fought against the Italians. We were not so eager to fight against the
                            Germans. We did not believe the stories about them. But the Italians
                            were very bad. They exterminated 40 percent of our people. It was
                            continuous guerrilla warfare. But now our relations with the Italians
                            are good. After all, they are one of our neighbors.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And you just bought a
                            big part of Fiat.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Yes. But, in general, people do not understand our Muslim
                            background and how we feel. We did not have a chance for education under
                            the Italians. When independence came, there were only five people in
                            Libya who had University education. I was number four. But <pb n="154"
                                facs="0181" xml:id="pg_154"/>now we have students everywhere. We
                            have 2,500 students in the United States.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Really! Then why are
                            our relations so complicated?</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: That is it! That is something many people do not understand.
                            There are 5,000 Americans in Libya. There is the oil business and there
                            are other businesses. There really are only two problems between us. The
                            first is our Ambassadors. Last year we gave you a name but you have
                            never accepted it. You have never responded to us. But we really need an
                            Ambassador in Washington in order to talk.</p>
                        <p>The second problem, of course, is military equipment. You know the Libyan
                            Air Force was created by the United States. After the revolution, we
                            tried to keep the F–5 Squadrons. All our personnel were trained in the
                            United States, but then the American supplies stopped so we had to
                            liquidate it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are also buying
                            massively from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: No, not really. We have Mirages. But I am really talking about
                            the cargo airplane.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The C–130.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Yes, the C–130. We tried for many years to accomplish this
                            purchase. We decided not to give up and to get you to execute the
                            contract. Last month I was told to lead a delegation to Washington to
                            talk about this. We were told by the woman who manages your Libya Desk
                            that there was no use in coming.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Were you authorized
                            only to talk about the planes, or about general relations?</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: About the planes and about general relations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to tell you in
                            all honesty that there are several problems. In the first place your
                            Government uses procedures we are not used to. I was told that you would
                            be sending a delegation to Lockheed and wanted to stop off in
                            Washington. I never understood the purpose of that mission. It was never
                            clear to me that it was a serious effort.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: But . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. I just want to
                            tell you how it appeared to me. And then, sometime ago, someone from the
                            Revolutionary Council wanted to talk. He wanted me to come to New York.
                            I said I could not, but <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>
                            could come to New York. Then he said o.k., I will come to Washington. We
                            waited for him but he never came. The next thing we knew he had left. We
                            never know why he asked for the appointment, or why he left.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: That was Captain Muhaishi. He had some difficulty with the regime
                            and now he is in Cairo. He is in charge of contacting Arab students to
                            get them to work in Arab countries after they graduate. He <pb n="155"
                                facs="0182" xml:id="pg_155"/>was here in that connection and at the
                            same time maybe he wanted to try to do some other business.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I just have to tell
                            you that this is the history—that this is the way it appears to us.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, throughout the world, Libya has very actively and in some
                            cases violently opposed the United States. Also in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> you are very hostile to what we are
                            trying to do. We could not avoid forming an opinion that many terrorists
                            activities are financed and supported by Libya. But I am personally
                            proud that during my period in office we have improved relations with
                            the Arabs and I would like to improve relations with Libya.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Maybe these things are sometimes exaggerated in the mass media.
                            We have a liberation movement in Libya. We cannot deny that but our role
                            is exaggerated. Sometimes we have to act in self-defense. You know we
                            read so much that was said against us. Even during the election
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Especially during the
                            campaign! (laughter)</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: There was Mondale who said that Libya must not be in the Security
                            Council. And Javits has made a campaign against us. These things happen
                            and you say this is only your free society. But now Mondale is the Vice
                            President. You know that our leaders do not want to be intimidated by a
                            big power. This you can understand. But if there is any effort toward
                            peace we will try to help. And we hope the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> will go one more important step and recognize the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. The United States wants to be the
                            arbitrator between the two sides but it is very difficult for the Arabs
                            to believe that America can change its commitment to Israel.</p>
                        <p>I think it would be a good thing in your relations with the Arabs if you
                            would recognize the Palestinians. There is no solution without them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All we want from them
                            is that they recognize Israel’s right to exist. If they do that, then
                            there would be a new situation. We have always said that we were
                            committed to the existence of Israel but we also say that we will do
                            everything we can to help find a just peace in the Middle East. But a
                            just peace does not mean the destruction of Israel.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we have brought about Israeli retreats in Syria and in
                            Egypt, and next year we may be able to take another step. The
                            Palestinian issue has a chance of resolution if they recognize Israel.
                            After all, we have never supported the Israeli occupation of Arab
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: You Americans are a big power. If you recognize the Palestinians
                            you can talk to them and exert pressure on them. We, as Arabs, cannot
                            betray the Palestinian cause.</p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="0183" xml:id="pg_156"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are not asking you
                            to betray the Palestinian cause. We would never do that.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: But in our bilateral relations we do not know what you expect
                            from us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t want you to
                            give up supporting the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. That is
                            given and we understand but those terrorists who killed 80 people in
                            Rome came from Libya, and that is not necessary, to say the least. We
                            want you to stop supporting these terrorists. Then we can have easier
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: We have relations with many Arabs. Arabs from the left, and Arabs
                            from the right. We cannot be responsible for the actions of all those
                            Arabs we are supporting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But we do not see why
                            you have to support those who are known to be terrorists.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: We support the Palestinians, of course. We know there are some
                            inside the Palestinians who do these things and we have condemned them.
                            In fact <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was very cruel.
                            He wanted to apply the old Arab rules and cut the hands off of those who
                            were in Rome. But we are a small country and it is sometimes difficult
                            for us to defend ourselves. We have only a few aircraft ourselves and
                            they are easily hijacked.</p>
                        <p>The other day Senator Javits said Libya was financing terrorists, and I
                            say does he have proof? If we were doing that he should have proof.
                            After all, you have over 5,000 Americans in Libya. You must know
                            something of what we think and what we are doing. To accuse us of
                            supporting terrorism is unfair.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You know, you should
                            get together with <persName corresp="#p_SWW_1">Scranton</persName> in
                            New York. He is a good friend and I have total confidence in him. You
                            could review relations with him. You could get fresh instructions from
                            Tripoli and then if you could present some concrete ideas, and we could
                            come up with some concrete suggestions too.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Can I tell Tripoli that the problem of planes will be resolved in
                            the context of our general relations?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can certainly tell
                            them that the problem of the Ambassadors will be handled in the context
                            of our general relations, but I must tell you it is not sensible for the
                            outgoing Administration to deal with the airplane question. But I would
                            think that the new Administration could look into it on an early
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Kikhia: Yes. I will see <persName corresp="#p_SWW_1"
                            >Scranton</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why don’t you meet
                            with him the middle of next week. By that time I will have talked to him
                            myself.</p>

                        <p>Following the meeting of the Senior Review Group on Policy Toward Morocco
                            November 30, 1972, the President has decided that the following views
                            should guide our course of action in the coming months:</p>
                        <p>—Our ties with Morocco are of sufficient importance that we should be
                            responsive to Moroccan requests that we reduce our presence at the
                            communications facilities if this is needed to preserve our overall
                            relationship. To this end, we should engage in negotiations with the
                            Moroccan government at an early date concerning our continued use of
                            communications and base facilities.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to deal with the King as the focal point of authority
                            and should take some steps to reassure him of continued U.S.
                            support.</p>
                        <p>—In addition to reducing our presence and profile at the communications
                            facilities we should make contingency preparations for transferring some
                            communications activities outside of Morocco as early as possible.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The reply to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>–160 on Morocco noted
                            that in the months since his escape from assassination last August, King
                            Hassan has remained shakily in power but has been unable to recover his
                            former poise and authority. Preoccupied with continued internal and
                            external threats to the monarchy, he has felt increasingly isolated at
                            home and internationally. His present position has also produced two
                            immediate problems which require our attention because of our continuing
                            political and strategic interest in a moderate regime in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>First, the King fears that the United States may have lost confidence in
                            him and be considering abandoning him. He harbors suspicions that we
                            were somehow involved in, or had prior knowledge of, the August
                            assassination attempt.</p>
                        <p>Second, in order to ease his domestic political problem, he has asked for
                            a re-examination of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military
                            presence in Morocco. This is the Kenitra naval communications complex,
                            which currently handles the bulk of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            naval communications to the Mediterranean and South Atlantic areas. He
                            apparently is not insisting on our withdrawal, but does want a
                            substantial revision of our presence to ease his internal problems and
                            public evidence of clearer benefits to Morocco from it. He may also be
                            raising the issue now in order to test our intentions toward him
                            personally.</p>
                        <p>We have recently received through intelligence channels indications that
                            the King continues to be seriously concerned about these two problems
                            and that he desires to receive a special envoy, who could speak on
                            behalf of the President, to discuss them. He would also like to send a
                            special representative of his own to Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_159"/>
                        <p>There is no doubt that the King’s position in Morocco is, at the moment,
                            shaky. There is, however, no immediate threat apparent to his rule. The
                            traditional political leaders are in disarray. The army, although
                            sullen, is apparently under control. From our standpoint, there seems no
                            visible alternative that could protect our own interests as well. The
                            King, now, as in the past, has shown himself impervious to advice
                            regarding his method of rule. We must accept him as he is. While
                            weighing the disadvantages of being identified with a monarchical regime
                            whose days could well be numbered, we have concluded that it is in our
                            interests to take this risk and to take those feasible steps which can
                            demonstrate our support for the King.</p>
                        <p>Following the review of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>–160 and
                            prior to receiving this latest indication of the King’s desires, we had
                            been considering the possible advantages to us of sending a special
                            envoy to the King. Alex Johnson had explored the matter with Robert
                            Murphy, who indicated he would be willing to go to Morocco in
                            mid-January in a private capacity to convey assurances of our continued
                            interest and support to King Hassan. Thus, a mid-January visit by Mr.
                            Murphy would coincide with our own desires and the King’s.</p>
                        <p>In conveying assurances of our continued friendship and support to the
                            King, Mr. Murphy could also express our willingness to explore with his
                            government ways in which our military presence could be adjusted to ease
                            his political problems. I enclose suggested instructions to Mr. Murphy
                            to meet these objectives, and also a draft suggested letter from you to
                            King Hassan, delivery of which would constitute an essential part of Mr.
                            Murphy’s mission.</p>
                        <p>This proposed action has been coordinated with the Department of
                            Defense.</p>

                        <p>1. That Robert Murphy be asked to undertake a special mission to King

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Agreeable to your instructions I visited Rabat, Morocco, on January 28
                            and 29, 1973, and enjoyed the hospitality of Ambassador and Mrs. Stuart
                            Rockwell at the Embassy Residence. The Ambassador and his staff provided
                            accommodation and access to the relevant Embassy files, together with
                            their advice and comments regarding the political, economic, military
                            and other aspects of the local situation. The events of 1971 and 1972
                            incident to the attempts on the life of King Hassan were fully
                            explained. Information regarding the purpose of my mission was
                            restricted to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Rockwell, on January 29, easily arranged an appointment for an
                            informal private meeting with the King and myself as the only ones
                            present. It was agreed that that type of tete-a-tete meeting would best
                            lend itself to freer communication by the King. Moroccan protocol
                            representatives called for me at the Embassy Chancery and conducted me
                            to the Palace in Rabat where the King immediately received me at the
                            entrance to the courtyard and conducted me to a reception room where no
                            one else was present. He was effusively friendly and seemed eager for
                            the meeting.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of amenities and delivery to him of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s letter, accompanied by a
                            French translation, there was a pleasant exchange of souvenirs of the
                            days of World War II, the Anfa Conference and about his Father Mohammed
                            V for whom I happened to have a high regard at the time. We dwelt quite
                            a bit on a small dinner President Roosevelt at Anfa gave for the then
                            Sultan very much to the annoyance of the French Resident General Nogues,
                            and at which the President made it quite clear that he considered the
                            day of the French Empire as ending and the independence of Morocco
                            inevitable. Mr. Churchill who also attended the dinner did not seem to
                            relish that aspect.</p>
                        <p>We talked, too, about the King’s health because at this time of year he
                            suffers from sinus infection or irritation with what seemed to me a
                            cigarette cough as he is a chain smoker. I assumed the role of father
                                <pb n="161" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_161"/>confessor, telling him I
                            stopped smoking in Algiers during World War II, with benefit to my
                            health, and all one needed to do was to take a decision. He said he
                            would think it over.</p>
                        <p>Then the King launched into a ten minute monologue on American-Moroccan
                            relations interlarded with many expressions of admiration for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, admiration for the
                            latter’s success in the Vietnamese question and the importance the King
                            attached to a close Moroccan-American relationship. He asserted that at
                            the present juncture a definition of the relationship is of urgent
                            mutual importance, and that there is a choice of three types of
                            relationship: (1) a system of exchange of information and points of
                            view; (2) a situation where Morocco and the United States are close
                            friends and allies; or (3) some form of agreed association.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the hope that after his Foreign Minister’s return from his
                            current visit to Moscow, the Minister could visit Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> for a discussion of the
                            problem. I said that I felt sure Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> would be most cooperative but that I was ignorant
                            of his immediate schedule during the coming weeks. I would inform him of
                            the King’s thought and suggestion.</p>
                        <p>This led to an opportunity to inquire whether on the King’s part,
                            incident to the two attempts on his life, he entertained any suspicion
                            or doubt concerning American involvement in <hi rend="italic"
                                >whatever</hi> form that might be. The King vehemently and
                            categorically denied he had ever entertained any suspicion that
                            Americans were involved or responsible; in fact, he is confident there
                            was none.</p>
                        <p>At this point the King said he had decided, however, to cancel the
                            sending of “stagiaires” (Moroccan military personnel for training and
                            study) to the U.S. This in no sense, the King emphasized, represents any
                            doubt regarding the American attitude; it simply means that in sending
                            young Moroccan military personnel the majority of whom come from modest,
                            even primitive peasant background, with very little if any knowledge of
                            the world, they are exposed to a free society with a much higher
                            standard of living, even opulence, which they enjoy—from the drugstore
                            type of availability, to the home life of America with automobiles,
                            television and the lot. After that, with stars in their eyes, they
                            return to the often primitive condition of their parents in the Moroccan
                            countryside. Their reactions range all the way from numb dissatisfaction
                            to outrage and a readiness to rebel. The King said he had no doubt this
                            feature played a role but that it is not to be construed as any witting
                            official American attitude, and he has no suspicion whatsoever of
                            subversion on our part.</p>
                        <p>The King said also that his feeling about the French is different. We had
                            been talking about the former French Resident General Nogues, <pb
                                n="162" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_162"/>and the frustration the French
                            suffered in the postwar period, their loss of status, and the
                            development of a rejected mistress complex. The King said there is a
                            growing tendency on their part to influence and even dominate certain
                            aspects, as in the educational field. Of course their investment in
                            Morocco is about three billion dollars equivalent, and the French colony
                            has grown again to its present ninety thousand. (The American
                            investment, is a modest $50 million.) While the King did not in any way
                            specifically blame French influence for the incidents, there was a
                            rather subtle connection in the way the King brought it up. There was no
                            hint or suggestion of Russian involvement even though the U.S.S.R. now
                            has about 140 officials and technicians in Rabat, Casablanca and
                            scattered around among projects under construction, etc. Russian
                            interest in this gateway to the Western Mediterranean is obvious, and
                            they are no doubt fully cognizant of Moroccan venality.</p>
                        <p>After having received the King’s assurance that he in no way suspected
                            Americans, there was opportunity at three different times to inquire,
                            which I did, whether the King had any specific suggestion for
                            adjustments of the present situation at the U.S. Naval Communications
                            Center at Kenitra (Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel). Each time the King avoided
                            a direct reply and passed on to points he had in mind. For example, the
                            King deplored that our military personnel lived apart from the Moroccan
                            community at Kenitra, with their own Church, post office, PX and
                            Commissary, etc.,—a sort of sovereignty within a sovereignty as he
                            expressed it. Morocco is well off in foodstuffs, fruits and vegetables,
                            yet our people preferred canned American products. He thinks that
                            unfortunate. I mentioned we had had similar reactions in other
                            countries. But the King did not ask that anything be done about it, or
                            that there should be a reduction in official staff or dependents. He
                            said that Moroccan opposition from time to time criticized his tolerance
                            in this regard. This did not seem to disturb him.</p>
                        <p>The King made a reference to a retired American Marine Colonel (John
                            Canton) residing in Morocco as the type of American who understood
                            Moroccan ways and problems, and who inspired confidence. We should have
                            more Americans like that living here. In that same connection the King
                            made a complimentary reference to Ambassador Henry Tasca who, he said,
                            always gave him a direct answer.</p>
                        <p>The King, at this point, referred to an American intelligence report
                            relayed to him via an intelligence officer (Dlimi) in his household [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] The King said
                            that it consisted of several papers containing numerous inaccuracies and
                            distortions regarding his own household and the internal Moroccan
                            political situation. The King said that he was dismayed that the
                            American Government would disseminate such false and misleading
                            statements even though they were <pb n="163" facs="0190" xml:id="pg_163"
                            />made by others than Americans. I said that I was not aware of the
                            report but would make an immediate inquiry.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (28 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it is hasty to form a conclusion based on one conversation, but I
                            certainly left with the distinct impression that barring some unhappy
                            incident, we could continue quietly along at Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>About this time the King dwelt a little on the Maghreb and the good
                            fortune of having <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> of
                            Libya out of it. The King, with a contemptuous gesture, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is “<hi rend="italic">un
                                fou</hi>” who doesn’t know what to do with the large amounts of
                            money which have poured into his country; that he doubts <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s ability to hold power. The
                            King made no reference to the recent visit of his Foreign Minister to
                            Moscow, and I did not refer to it. I am sure this will be explained when
                            and if <persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName> meets with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation had continued for almost an hour and a half, I took
                            the initiative to thank the King for the warmth of his reception, and
                            renewed expression of our sympathetic interest in his many problems. At
                            departure he repeated expressions of his high regard for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>: While the King demonstrated confidence
                            and assurance, with no complaint whatever for the bad luck of the
                            attempts on his life, the problems of corruption in his entourage, or
                            his failure to attain a broad-based government, it is clear to me, I
                            believe, that there is a strong yearning on his part for restoration of
                            his prestige, and a desire to be treated by us on a level with countries
                            like Iran or Spain, for example. Perhaps he has more than an average
                            amount of personal pride, and we should act accordingly. While I touched
                            lightly on American policy resulting from our budgetary imbalance and
                            huge international obligations, the deficit in our balance of trade and
                            payments, we have a problem to stimulate adjustment of Moroccan thinking
                            to the present situation. We should exploit every opportunity, where
                            possible, without expenditure of funds, to reassure Hassan personally of
                            our high regard for Morocco, and associate ourselves with appropriate
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The question of the Spanish Sahara did not arise.</p>
                        <p>After this conversation, Ambassador Rockwell and I dined with the King’s
                            brother, Prince Moulay Abdullah, and a half dozen officials in a very
                            relaxed and friendly atmosphere of no especial political significance
                            except that the host could not have acted in a more pro-American
                            fashion. Ambassador Rockwell tells me that Moulay Abdullah, who was
                            painfully wounded by a bullet which hit his elbow in the Skhirat
                            assassination attempt, demonstrated at the time great <pb n="164"
                                facs="0191" xml:id="pg_164"/>bravery and poise. Again, Moulay
                            Abdullah also obviously entertains no suspicion of American
                            involvement.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>
                            expressed pleasure in the opportunity to meet with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the
                            President was very sorry that he had not been able to receive the
                            Foreign Minister. He had had to cancel all <pb n="165" facs="0192"
                                xml:id="pg_165"/>of his appointments the previous day to prepare for
                            his nation-wide speech marking the end of the Vietnam war and, because
                            of his departure for San Clemente this afternoon, had had to concentrate
                            a number of appointments in a very short period of time today.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he was grateful to the President for his
                            having asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to
                            receive him.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> continued that the
                            President had wanted him to see the Foreign Minister and to communicate
                            the extreme importance which we attach to our relations with
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that King Hassan appreciated those sentiments
                            which had also been expressed in the President’s most recent letter to
                            His Majesty. The King had also appreciated the President sending
                            Ambassador Robert Murphy to see him.</p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that in recent months <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Moroccan relations had “crossed” some points of
                            “reserve”, and direct contacts were valuable in providing opportunity
                            for explaining on both sides why the relationship has reached this
                            point. The President’s invitation for the Foreign Minister to come to
                            Washington and the Murphy visit to Rabat had given the King an
                            opportunity to explain his view of what had happened.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that the main point on the King’s mind is to find out
                            what will be <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in relation to
                            Moroccan policies in three areas—national policy, foreign relations and
                            economic progress.</p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="0193" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                        <p>On the question of national policy, the Foreign Minister explained that
                            the King had some time ago embarked on a policy of greater liberalism in
                            domestic politics than existed elsewhere in the North African area. This
                            experiment did not succeed. Some opposition leaders had used this
                            liberalization against the government, not to move toward greater
                            democracy as the King had intended. Referring to the two attempts on the
                            King’s life, he noted that the government had had “two bad experiences”
                            over the last two years and also had detected Libyan-trained guerrillas
                            infiltrating into Morocco through Spain and Algeria. The King had
                            decided that he had to reverse the trend toward greater liberalization
                            and concentrate on restoring authority.</p>
                        <p>Turning to foreign relations, the Foreign Minister expressed Moroccan
                            feeling that the Western Mediterranean is a key area. Its security is
                            important to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests as well as for
                            the defense of Morocco. The King would like to know how the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> views its interests there and what kind
                            of cooperation among the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, Morocco and
                            other partners in the area might be possible in maintaining its
                            security. Morocco feels that it can play a role, perhaps with Spain, not
                            only in the Western Mediterranean area but perhaps also in the Western
                            Sahara, Mauritania and Senegal.</p>
                        <p>On the question of domestic development—“prosperity,” as the Minister
                            calls it—the Minister pointed out that Morocco’s needs are so
                            significant that it is not easy to meet them with Morocco’s own
                            resources. At the same time, it is necessary to preserve armed forces
                            which can provide national security and the defense of Morocco’s
                            borders. Sometimes <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> credit conditions
                            make it difficult for Morocco to procure military equipment from the
                            United States. Morocco is getting some of its arms from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, but this is purely a “commercial
                            choice and not a political choice.” If the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> could look at this aspect of Moroccan security, it would
                            help because Morocco prefers <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that these are the main points
                            in the Moroccan view at this time. His Majesty is very interested in
                            taking the first possible opportunity to see the President. However, he
                            cannot move from the country at this point. He has assumed direct charge
                            over his programs there. However, if the President were to travel to the
                            area, the King would appreciate it very much if the President could stop
                            in Morocco for a day or two. In the meantime, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> would be most welcome to
                            come to Morocco under any conditions he might choose. The King believes
                            in direct contact.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the Minister said that Moroccans want to understand what
                            relationship they will have with the United States. They want to know
                            whether it will be an old friendship with relations “good but empty” or
                            whether Morocco and the United States will be associates in some new
                            venture.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that he also
                            believed in direct contact. The President would certainly give very
                            careful consideration to a visit to Morocco as his travel plans become
                            firmer. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                            he also would consider a visit to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that “we in
                            this building” agree that Morocco might play a role in the Western
                            Mediterranean such as Iran plays at the other end of the region. He
                            noted that he had personally not been able to become deeply involved in
                            the question of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Moroccan
                            relationships. He had held meetings on the question of the military
                            bases but he felt that that was not the central issue, for that issue
                            would fall into place.</p>
                        <p>As for his own travel, he said that he is trying at this point not to
                            move around as much as he had in the past. However, he may go to Europe
                            from time to time. He noted that he had always been fascinated with
                            Morocco and at one point had even attempted to arrange a vacation there.
                            He said that he would certainly keep very much in mind a visit to
                            Morocco. He said that in principle he would be happy to make such a stop
                            if he were in Europe at some point. “We can aim for this.”</p>
                        <p>On the question of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Moroccan
                            relationship, he said that he did not feel that the real issue is the
                            question of legal documents or alli<pb n="167" facs="0194"
                                xml:id="pg_167"/>ances. The real issue is what kind of relationship
                            we have. He said that he hoped the Moroccans would communicate any
                            precise ideas they might have.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked the Foreign
                            Minister to tell His Majesty that we greatly appreciate his sending the
                            Foreign Minister to Washington. He hoped that the Foreign Minister would
                            convey to His Majesty that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> finds it “inconceivable” that there could have
                            been any <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> connection with the coup
                            attempts in Morocco. We in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> have
                            always identified Moroccan stability with the King’s regime, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has a strong interest in Moroccan
                            stability. He assured the Minister that the King’s government will never
                            be under pressure from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to adopt
                            any particular domestic course of action, nor will he have to be
                            concerned about the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> consorting with
                            his opposition. To reiterate, he hoped that the Minister would let us
                            know whatever concrete ideas he might have on the question of our longer
                            term relationship.</p>
                        <p>In parting, the Foreign Minister again thanked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and the President for his
                            reception in the White House. He knew that King Hassan would be very
                            pleased.</p>

                        <p>2. On April 10 King Hassan received Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> and me for cordial meeting
                            which lasted an hour.</p>
                        <p>3. King began by expressing thanks for fine atmosphere surrounding
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>’s visit
                            to Washington. He particularly grateful for friendly attitude toward
                            himself personally which <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> had
                            reported.</p>
                        <p>4. King said he sought cooperation between <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> and Morocco such as existed between <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Iran and <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> and Saudi Arabia. He thought same kind of problems
                            existed in all three regions. Iran faced problem of subversion from Iraq
                            and Soviet pressure; Saudi Arabia had its problems with radical Arabs
                            and effects of Middle East conflict; Morocco faced subversion by Libya
                            and uncertainty concerning Algeria’s intentions. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> had “crossroads” in Tehran and Riyadh; he would like it
                            to have similar “crossroad” in Rabat.</p>
                        <p>5. He had told Ambassador Murphy that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            and Morocco could be casual acquaintances, friends, or associates and
                            that he greatly preferred latter. Murphy had said he had no authority
                            but was sure President preferred latter category as well.</p>
                        <p>6. Turning to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military facilities in
                            Morocco, King said he was not among those who say “go home” to
                            Americans. Nonetheless he had nothing to justify to Moroccan man in
                            street <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military presence, which did
                            not benefit Morocco directly. If this presence could be related to
                            meaningful global aid program, man in street might even say give
                            American more bases if they want. As it was, however, facilities were
                            “security risk” for King.</p>
                        <p>7. King went on to say he did not wish Morocco to remain in present
                            “narrow jacket.” Moslem countries of Black Africa had religious interest
                            in Morocco and in him personally. He would like to expand Moroccan
                            influence in those countries to counter colonialist French influence and
                            that of Algeria. He would like to send books, doctors and teachers. If
                            he had forty years of peace and the money that Algeria had, he could
                            transform Moslem Black Africa into area which would look toward Morocco,
                            a development which he believed would be in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> interest. However, he did not have resources for this
                            enterprise and wanted <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> help.</p>
                        <p>8. King said he realized Executive Branch had problems with Congressional
                            restrictions but believed President could divide total amount of funds
                            provided by Congress for foreign assistance as he saw fit.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said he grateful to
                            King for receiving him. Reception we had given <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName> in Washington and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>’s presence here revealed our
                            continuing support for King Hassan and our best wishes for his efforts
                            in promoting development and stability of Morocco. Our attitude toward
                            Morocco arose from past tradition of friendly relations, <pb n="169"
                                facs="0196" xml:id="pg_169"/>from Morocco’s strategic location, and
                            from our general accord with the policies of King Hassan.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had sought through recent
                            contacts, including Murphy Mission and <persName corresp="#p_BAT_1"
                                >Benhima</persName>’s visit Washington, to reinforce ties and to
                            clarify Moroccan views concerning relationship. We now understood King
                            wanted “global” approach rather than concentration on arrangements at
                            Kenitra. We accepted this, however we had limitations on our resources
                            and certain major priorities such as Viet-Nam and establishment of peace
                            in Southeast Asia. Despite this, President does not want to neglect our
                            other friends, especially those in such important part of world as North
                            Africa. In this context we wish to discuss how we can strengthen our
                            cooperation with Morocco. Military assistance is a real problem, but we
                            will do our best. We will hope to do more in context five year plan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> stressed to King that
                            Congress does make specific allocations of aid which cannot be
                            substantially altered by Executive Branch. Nonetheless he assured King
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest in his success, in
                            stability of Morocco, and of our understanding of his problems.</p>
                        <p>11. King said that Morocco approved of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            policy toward Algeria. “It would be easier to capitalize Algeria than to
                            socialize Morocco.” The more Algeria became concerned with economic
                            development, the less would be its interest in adventurism. Therefore El
                            Paso Agreement was fine, “but please don’t forget Morocco.”</p>
                        <p>12. King said he wished ask President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> to request “that madman” Qadafi of Libya to be
                            less crazy. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> should tell Qadafi it is
                            with its money he is working and not to work against friends of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. King asserted Libya training opposition
                            subversives for operations against Algeria, Tunisia, Senegal, Iran,
                            Sudan and Jordan. He has budgeted $40 million for this work. King was
                            certain Libya would not nationalize <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            oil interests since it could not operate oil industry by itself. He said
                            Libyans were employing Greek and French mercenaries. Libyan subversion
                            was cause for real concern.</p>
                        <p>13. Referring to Algeria, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                            said King helped start process of bettering <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Algerian relations three years ago when he facilitated
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’ meeting with
                            Algerian Ambassador in Rabat. We are seeking positive elements for
                            effective relationship with Algeria such as Gass Agreement but have many
                            more areas of understanding with Morocco than with Algeria. We would not
                            forget Morocco.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said Libya also causes
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> grave concern. Problem was as
                            King had described—returns from <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            private investment were being used to provide Qadafi with extraordinary
                            power. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> ability act extremely limited.
                            He asked King whether he thought Libyan policy was personal with Qadafi
                            or reflected sentiment of his collaborators. King said Qadafi only had
                            support of Jallud and Haweidi—all other members of <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC_1">RCC</gloss> wanted to return to Maghrebian
                            cooperation. King re<pb n="170" facs="0197" xml:id="pg_170"/>ferred to
                            agreement to resume normal relations with Morocco which had been reached
                            with Al <persName corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Huni</persName> via Moroccan
                            Ambassador to Rome, only to be reversed by Qadafi.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> asked if King thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was resisting
                            Libyan efforts to work against Morocco. King said <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> had refused several Libyan
                            requests to cooperate against Morocco but nonetheless arms had crossed
                            Algeria into Morocco. Either <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> knows or he doesn’t know. First instance
                            would be grave for Algeria and Morocco; second would be graver for
                            Algeria since arms for use against <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> might also be circulating. Future of
                            Morocco’s relations with Algeria uncertain. If Algeria proves sincere,
                            border agreement signed by King will be ratified by Moroccan parliament.
                            If Algeria proves hostile, King will sacrifice a dam and some economic
                            development and re-arm to defend his country.</p>

                            that your time is even shorter here than it used to be in Washington. I
                            appreciate being able to see you. I won’t keep you very long. I want to
                            convey the greetings of my Government, of His Majesty, and my own.</p>
                        <p>We know that your arrival at the Department of State is an important
                            event for the world, and we expect the same quality of work as we saw in
                            the post you already held.</p>

                            Bilateral Relations</p>
                        <p>As for relations between Morocco and the United States, since my useful
                            meetings with you and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> in March, relations have been satisfactory
                            between our two countries. Nevertheless, I understand there are certain
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Which? PL 480?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: It has to do with
                            economic assistance. We understand the problem on the part of Congress.
                            If Congress doesn’t permit an increase in aid through the normal
                            process, then we hope that the question of the leased bases on our soil
                            will be reassessed, perhaps favorably.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>:] Is that possible?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: It is possible. We have
                            already made use of that in sustaining the levels. We’re very conscious
                            of the link between the two, and so is the Congress.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: Morocco is now in the
                            process of a Five-Year Plan, a very ambitious one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: We have given the
                            Government of Morocco a figure on economic aid at the current level. The
                            Minister of Planning is coming here. Before going to the Congress, we
                            will be able to review the Minister’s plan and do what we can.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: I ought to indicate to
                            you that it is still possible to do other things.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We attach great
                            importance to our relations with Morocco, as I told you last time.
                            Whatever is humanly possible, we will do. We will look at it again when
                            your Minister comes here.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: One problem is PL 480. We
                            are short, and this is a problem for every country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: We have been seeking
                            grain on the open market but cannot get enough. We need about one

                        <p>On security, progress in our cooperation between Washington and Rabat is
                            very good. There have been some military missions. These have enabled
                            Morocco to consider its regional and domestic problems.</p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_172"/>
                        <p>There are two small particular problems. We have a very critical
                            situation with Algeria. We don’t want to bring the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> into a quarrel with our neighbor, but we
                            think you should be informed because of our friendship. We want to call
                            this to your attention. I will leave a detailed document with you. [Tab
                            A] In March we stopped a group of people passing into Morocco with arms,
                            Russian arms, from Libya carried through Algeria, to be given to
                            subversive elements. They were Russian arms from Egypt to Libya.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty had wanted to call the attention of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to this transit of arms.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> professed to
                            desire good relations with Morocco but we could not believe they were
                            unaware of this transit. We gave all our information to him. He promised
                            to make an investigation. But no reply or comment was ever received. We
                            then asked <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName> to come,
                            and told him the same information, but with the same result. The first
                            group was captured, tried and executed. Two weeks ago, we found the same
                            type of arms—the same bags, etc., and the same itinerary.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty wrote a letter to Algeria. He said that we had resolved the
                            border conflict in order to help avoid big-power involvement. We didn’t
                            want a big-power confrontation. This was our sacrifice, in the interests
                            of not making the Mediterranean a crisis area. But now the Russians are
                            at Mers el-Kebir. We had never allowed people to pass through Morocco
                            who were hostile to Algeria. We want to resolve problems locally, to
                            preserve stability in the region.</p>
                        <p>We don’t know what this means. Our relations had been satisfactory. But
                            Algeria is next to Libya. There seems to be a rapprochement between
                            Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia, without us, which may be a problem for us.
                            We don’t want you to solve it, but we want you to be informed. We don’t
                            understand why Algeria is doing this. It may be that they want to woo
                            Qaddafi away from Egypt. But I don’t see the point, because the
                            Egyptians don’t want him anyway.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What could we do if we
                            wanted?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: You could perhaps speak
                            to them. You could congratulate Morocco and Algeria for solving their
                            local problems, and signal to Algeria that you want the region to be a
                            region of peace. Although we don’t want to compromise our economic
                            development, we could be forced to turn to arms. If they seek arms from
                            the East, we will seek arms from the West, and then they will seek arms,
                            and so on, if an arms race starts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your impression is
                            that Algeria will pay any attention to what we think?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: They’ll at least pay
                            some attention to friendly advice.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You say <persName
                                corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName> is going to Morocco?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: No, but he is going to
                            Tunisia. If we have any influence it’s with Tunisia. And they’re very
                            active.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: Because their Foreign
                            Minister sees prospects of encouraging Maghreb unity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That has nothing to do
                            with arms shipments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: Right, but if we have
                            influence, it’s with them.</p>
                        <p>This last shipment was during the Algiers Non-Aligned Conference?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: No, after.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When did we get the
                            information?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: I spoke with <persName

                            impression that Algeria listens to us on economic matters but not on
                            political.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: We’d like to go straight

                        <p>Another point I want to raise: We have friendly relations with Spain, and
                            cooperation. Morocco and Spain have some problems now. We have hoped
                            that relations would develop in the interests of global and regional
                            security. But there are certain problems. We are preoccupied with the
                            [Spanish] Sahara. Spain seems to be thinking now of independence for it.
                            We ask, why should it be independent? It is a country of 45,000 people,
                            two-thirds uneducated. It controls the sea routes. I don’t want you to
                            think that Morocco wants it for itself. We asked Spain what its
                            intentions were. They were not clear.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why do they do it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: They are obliged to be
                            for decolonization—because they need the support of Africans against the
                            United Kingdom on Gibraltar. Spain is saying it should be independent.
                            We are against all liberation movements; we fear infiltration. We would
                            prefer the status quo, but Spain wants to act quickly. We won’t
                            participate in this liberation movement. We have told Spain that the
                            security of the Western Mediterranean is indivisible. Spain has said to
                            us that security in the northwest Mediterranean is separate from
                            security in the Atlantic. I think it’s in the middle of the question of
                            the security of the region.</p>
                        <p>It is a question of whether we can concentrate on economic problems or
                            the questions of arms. We don’t want to compromise our <pb n="174"
                                facs="0201" xml:id="pg_174"/>efforts by again placing priorities on
                            buying arms. We don’t want to be forced to change our policy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>: The problems are related.
                            Algeria, Mauritania and Libya are pressing for liberation of the
                            territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAT_1">Benhima</persName>: If this goes, it will be
                            the first place between Oslo and the Cape on the Atlantic that is not
                            pro-West. Algeria wants access to the Atlantic. Morocco doesn’t want to
                            be isolated or encircled, as the French did against Algeria.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is an interesting
                            point.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>(S) As a result of the re-assessment of the Africa Bureau and our
                            Ambassador to Morocco that our planned withdrawal from Kenitra by the
                            end of 1976 would have serious implications for our relations with King
                            Hassan, coupled with the uncertainty of next year’s base rights
                            negotiations with Spain, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Schlesinger</persName> has approved the following position:</p>
                        <p>—Plans for our withdrawal from Morocco and related upgrading of Rota
                            should be held in abeyance until after the Spanish negotiations and that
                            a re-evaluation of our position in both countries should be made at that
                            time. This delay, of course, would be contingent upon King Hassan’s
                            continued favorable disposition to our military presence.</p>
                        <p>(U) If this is agreeable with the Department of State, I recommend that
                            you inform the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff of our revised

                            against accepting alternatives to the M–60s, we plan to tell him that
                            our decision on tanks will be communicated separately.</p>

                            much longer lead-times and would necessitate modification of Morocco’s

                        <p>2565. Subj: Military Assistance to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary. Met with King today. He in somber mood over problem of
                            reaching agreement on military assistance package. Discussions regarding
                            which have been dragging on for some months. Moroccans concerned about
                            (1) availabilities and lead times for equipment they want, (2) credit
                            terms. Of the two, latter is most acute problem at present. Met with
                            Foreign Minister this evening to explain various credit packages being
                            offered. No decisions taken, but we have work cut out for us. We need
                            all the help we can get.</p>
                        <p>2. In compliance with my request, I was granted audience with King at
                            1015 June 6. Meeting took place at Skhirat Palace south of Rabat. I
                            began by explaining, along lines Presidential message, circumstances
                            which had made it necessary for President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> to cancel his trip to North Africa. I also
                            repeated the instructions to me, contained in the President’s message to
                            King, about resumption of discussion at an early moment regarding King’s
                            postponed State Visit to America. King <pb n="177" facs="0204"
                                xml:id="pg_177"/>replied that he had been very sorry about
                            President’s change in plans. He would have liked very much to welcome
                            him as President in contrast to his previous visits as Vice President
                            and private citizen.</p>
                        <p>3. He also had other reasons for regretting this change of plans. He had
                            been looking forward to a personal visit with the President in order to
                            bring to a head the negotiations over military supplies and their
                            financing which had been dragging over the last few months. In view of
                            the great <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest previously
                            expressed in Morocco, difficulties being experienced in reaching
                            agreement were hard to understand.</p>
                        <p>4. Morocco did not want gifts and was able to pay. But one had to bear in
                            mind that what they were buying was the country’s security, which <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has stated was of interest to it.
                            Military supplies unfortunately are not like investments which
                            eventually produce economic gain. In this light, demands for repayment
                            in seven years and interest rates as high as 14 percent were just too
                            much. The King did not wish to sound suspicious or be indelicate,
                            especially as he was certain I was doing my best, but he was beginning
                            to wonder what the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s real
                            intentions were. Slowness of response, small quantities offered, high
                            cost, and high interest rates were not evidence of great friendship.</p>
                        <p>5. King said country was denuded of defense and needed equipment fast.
                            Surely 80 to 100 tanks were not too much to ask of a country that gave
                            thousands to others. (King had figures on his desk to which he pointed
                            without specification. They were perhaps aid figures from Secretary’s
                            June 4 press conference.)</p>
                        <p>6. The King said further what he needed was M60 tanks and fast. He had to
                            work with officers who had just come back from Syria. These officers
                            knew very well that “others” had offered comparable equipment to be
                            delivered immediately and under better conditions. These officers, who
                            had worked with and seen the Soviet T64 (not clear whether King meant
                            T62 or T54) in operation, could not understand why the King clung to
                            hope for American equipment, and inferior equipment at that, such as the
                            M48A3.</p>
                        <p>7. I replied that I understood His Majesty’s concern, but that the delay
                            was caused not merely by <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> but also by
                            lack of Moroccan response to more favorable earlier offers made in
                            February, immediately after General Partain’s second visit. I further
                            expressed some surprise at King’s remarks about the M60’s. We had looked
                            into the M60 question and found that they would require a three year
                            delay before delivery. I thought that when his Majesty had received
                            General Partain and myself, he had expressed his acceptance of the
                            M48A3. We had of course noted the King’s categoric rejection of the
                            A1.</p>
                        <p>8. The King pulled back from that point saying the A3 was acceptable if
                            deliveries were fast and the price was right. But he has lost two <pb
                                n="178" facs="0205" xml:id="pg_178"/>hundred million dollars in the
                            intervention in Syria and Egypt and this imposed a burden.</p>
                        <p>9. I then gave explanation of current credit offers, separating the
                            question of $12 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit from
                            the rest and pointing out that we were in danger of losing even <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits with their more favorable
                            interest rate the guarantee provided if Moroccans did not respond
                            quickly.</p>
                        <p>10. The King, after hearing of the new offer by the Ivor Clark Group on
                            the $12 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit (9–1/4
                            percent fixed over 10 years) thought that this might be acceptable and
                            instructed the Foreign Minister, who was present, to meet with me,
                                <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss>. Sanders (Chief <gloss
                                target="#t_MUSLO_1">MUSLO</gloss>) and our Economic Counselor today
                            to go further into this matter.</p>
                        <p>11. I further explained our supply problem which in part was the result
                            of role which America now playing in Middle East settlement. Everybody
                            now wanted American equipment, while supply situation would eventually
                            improve, for time being I had to go by the lead times which my experts
                            gave me, although they were admittedly pessimistic. I gave it as my
                            purely personal view that greater demands on our supply lines were
                            creating difficulties now but would eventually result in shorter
                            delivery times as factories geared themselves to meet those demands.</p>
                        <p>12. Met with Minister of Foreign Affairs at 1800 local, accompanied by
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>, Economic Counselor and Chief
                                <gloss target="#t_MUSLO_1">MUSLO</gloss>. Foreign Minister had
                            Secretary of State for Finance, Secretary General of Ministry of Defense
                            (Achabar) and Director of Cabinet with him. Discussion lasting one hour
                            devoted entirely to technical details of credit offers. We successfully
                            separated question of $12 million in <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> guaranteed <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit
                            from purely commercial offers and believe we now have <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> adequately briefed. Tone of meeting
                            friendly, compared to somber mood of meeting with King this morning, but
                            it clear there are several things preoccupying Moroccans:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss>. Achabar obviously troubled by
                            change from direct to guaranteed <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credits being offered this year as opposed to last. Moroccans would be
                            much happier dealing with direct government credit than with private
                            credit, even if guaranteed by <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.
                            While we explained need to resort to private sector to expand credit
                            facilities we could offer in wake extensive commitments of last fall,
                            Achabar bemused by fact that type of credit changed just as Moroccans
                            came to us for more help. He obviously suspects sinister motive.</p>
                        <p>B. Ministry of Finance representative and Foreign Minister quite properly
                            concerned about rates of interest, grace periods and repayment periods.
                            Current terms seem very stiff to them. We suspect their reaction in part
                            due to fact they reportedly have offer on much easier <pb n="179"
                                facs="0206" xml:id="pg_179"/>terms (6.5 percent as opposed to
                            roughly 13.5 percent we offering) from French.</p>
                        <p>13. It was agreed that Chief <gloss target="#t_MUSLO_1">MUSLO</gloss>,
                            who returning to Washington on consultation this weekend, would gather
                            various offers and present them to Minister of Finance Abdelqadr
                            Binslimane, who will be in Washington next week. We will try to get
                            Moroccans pinned down by end of next week or beginning of following week
                            as to whether they accept our $12 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> offer. We are going to have hard time, however, for
                            several reasons:</p>
                        <p>A. We are not offering the equipment originally requested by Moroccans,
                            and, in order to meet their requirements for rapid delivery, will have
                            to provide (we understand informally) tanks which are not even
                            reconditioned but have been taken directly from reserve units.</p>
                        <p>B. Our credit terms will be considerably stiffer than they can get
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>C. Moroccans do not understand why we can be so generous in Middle East
                            and not give them more.</p>

                        <p>(C) After the amenities, <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss> Dlimi said
                            that King Hassan had sent him to discuss the problems created by the
                            long lead-times for the equipment requested for the Moroccan Armed
                            Forces. The <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> believed that the
                            lead-times should conform with those provided in the Partain Report and,
                            as a manifestation of our close relationship, hoped that this could be
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>(C) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said that the
                            U.S. shared Morocco’s desire for good relations and saw no reason that
                            they would not continue in the future. Morocco continues to give us what
                            we want, and likewise we want to be as responsive as we can to Morocco’s
                            request.</p>
                        <p>(C) Ambassador Boutaleb said that both sides seem to agree in principle
                            in the desire for our new expanded relationship, but there are some
                            specific problems to be solved. The <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            has money and is asking for equipment from Washington because of our
                            political ties. The <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> had not gone
                            elsewhere because only Washington could pro<pb n="181" facs="0208"
                                xml:id="pg_181"/>vide what the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            really wanted. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clements</persName>’ request for specific problems, <gloss
                                target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss> Dlimi said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> wanted all of the equipment delivered
                            within 36 months. The Letters of Offer that had been provided indicated
                            lead-times that were considerably beyond that period.</p>
                        <p>(C) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> suggested that we
                            would have some happy news on some items very soon. LTG Fish said we
                            were trying to make improvements on lead-times and was optimistic that
                            some items could be improved. For example, we hope to provide rebuilt
                            M–48A3s, as well as rebuilt and upgunned M–48A5s. <gloss
                                target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss> Dlimi noted that Morocco already has
                            26 M–48A3s and that it wanted to avoid that experience by getting new
                            equipment; consequently, they needed M60s. LTG Fish explained that M60s
                            have a much longer lead-time, up to five years. M–48A5s were considered
                            prime assets and interchangeable or on par with M60s. They would be
                            completely reworked and modernized.</p>
                        <p>(C) At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Schlesinger</persName> came in and said to <gloss target="#t_Col_1"
                                >Col</gloss> Dlimi that we will attempt to solve the supply problem
                            and hoped that his best wishes would be given to King Hassan. The
                            Secretary then left the room.</p>
                        <p>(S) In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>’
                            query on the threat, <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss> Dlimi said
                            that Morocco’s military equipment is obsolete. The Soviet attempt at
                            infiltration and influence is very great in North Africa today.
                            Countries such as Algeria and Libya cannot use all the equipment they
                            are obtaining from the Soviets. Morocco has problems with Spain over the
                            Sahara, and Algeria is not supporting the Moroccan position, apparently
                            more interested in its own aims for the Sahara. Morocco is concerned
                            that Algeria may take some initiative and wants to be ready. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> is concerned that Algeria wants its
                            own direct access to the Atlantic. The Soviets are also involved in
                            other countries in Africa, for example, Guinea. Moroccans are, after
                            all, Africans and want that part of the world free from Soviet
                            intimidation and penetration. As a demonstration of the Moroccan
                            awareness of the threat to the area and the Moroccan desire to have a
                            U.S. commitment, the King had authorized him to extend for subsequent
                            consideration the offer of <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> and
                            Navy bases in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>(S) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said that the
                            King’s offer was most pleasing. We could have problems with our
                            negotiations for our bases in Spain and the Moroccan offer was most
                            helpful. There might be circumstances where such an offer might be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>(C) <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col</gloss> Dlimi then presented to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> copies of a plan
                            for the phased acquisition of equipment calling for all deliveries to be
                            made within 36 months and designating annual increments for 1975, 1976,
                            and 1977. LTC Terhzaz said that the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            was also waiting for answers on tanks and <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="0209" xml:id="pg_182"/>
                        <p>(C) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said we were
                            optimistic that we would be able to improve some delivery times and
                            asked LTG Fish whether this information could be developed by the end of
                            the week. LTG Fish said the list was terribly long, but we would work
                            out what we could with LTC Terhzaz. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> agreed but said we would also
                            want to send a message to our Ambassador in Rabat for his follow-on
                            discussion, as well. LTG Fish noted that we have a new problem in that
                            we have to notify Congress for a 20-day period on such sales, but we
                            would be prepared to give tentative answers before then. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> then summarized the
                            understanding that we would provide answers by the end of the week.</p>

                        <p>After introductions and pleasantries the King stated that he was very
                            grateful for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>’ visit
                            and that he would be brief. He said that in the Middle East the conflict
                            between Israel and the Arabs was in part a conflict between Eastern and
                            Western civilizations. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clements</persName> that militarily Morocco, as well as he
                            personally, had chosen the West.</p>
                        <p>The King next commented that we don’t want to arm ourselves too much but
                            the armaments which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has delivered
                            so far has put Morocco in a delicate situation. Not enough parts and
                            ammunition were delivered. This placed the King in an embarrassing
                            situation with re<pb n="183" facs="0210" xml:id="pg_183"/>spect to his
                            own Army. He stated “very frankly the impression of the Moroccan
                            officers is that I made a bad choice in the source of supply.” The King
                            said he understood our problems in supply were due to the war in
                            Vietnam, the problems of the Army in Europe, and the Middle East supply
                            and that compared to all these Morocco was only a small drop.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> interrupted and
                            said, “but a very important drop.”</p>
                        <p>His Majesty said that on the basis of Morocco’s being the oldest country
                            which has never broken off relations with the United States, he wanted
                            to discuss the two nations’ friendship in utter frankness. He stated
                            that Morocco is a mirror in the Arab world in its relations with the
                            United States and that Morocco needed to be a better mirror.</p>
                        <p>At this point the King presented to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clements</persName> a document written in French listing military
                            equipment for which Morocco asked the shortest possible delivery
                            times.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> received the
                            document telling him we would give it all consideration.</p>
                        <p>The King went on to discuss his meeting with the Algerian Foreign
                            Minister which had taken place a few days before. He noted that they had
                            been together for 48 hours with over 5 hours of solid conversation. They
                            were two old friends who had known each other for a long time and had
                            been lieutenants together in a friendship going back to 1958. The
                            Minister came to tell the King that “if Spain leaves the Sahara, not one
                            Algerian soldier will cross the frontier.” The Minister stated that
                            never again would Algeria enter into a 1963-type situation between the
                            two countries. He said he came as a friend to deliver this message. The
                            King said that he thanked him and told him to thank President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The King said that the Algerian position was on one hand explainable by
                            virtue but on the other hand by the imperatives of the situation.
                            Algeria had always said they had no claim on the Sahara. Therefore,
                            there would be no motive for Algeria to take any action. He further said
                            that if Algeria went to war with Morocco the Arab world would have to
                            choose between the two countries. The King said the majority would
                            choose Morocco and that this would break the unity of the Arab world.
                            Algeria would never want that responsibility. He said Algeria for years
                            had sided with non-alligned countries. Also, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> is the President of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>. The King said that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> could not be an aggressor in such a
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The King asked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                            discreetly transmit to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> that the situation in Algeria was not stable. As
                            long as <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was in charge
                            the King considered that relations with Morocco would remain quiet. He
                            then stated that, although <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> is able, <pb n="184" facs="0211"
                                xml:id="pg_184"/>if he (the King) were an insurance agent he would
                            not issue a policy on the Algerian President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> questioned the King
                            as to the nature of the unrest in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>The King responded that the opposition was very active and thinking in
                            terms of a coup d’état which the King considered a distinct possibility.
                            He had come by this information from the opposition “through an
                            intermediary, of course.” He said that the question was also asked him
                            at that time, “what would be the attitude of the United States if a coup
                            d’état did occur in Algeria?” The King assured the questioner that he
                            could not speak for the United States but that it would not want to get
                            mixed up in Algerian affairs; that currently a balance exists; and if
                            the balance were broken, not only the United States but also the entire
                            Atlantic region would have problems.</p>
                        <p>The King then returned to the subject of Morocco’s military strength and
                            stated that while he does not have belligerent neighbors he must look
                            into the future. He stated that, as the Admiral well knew, the military
                            requires strength even though the civilian leaders are pushing for
                            détente. He stated that in his country he is both civilian leader and
                            military leader and for this reason must be concerned with both
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The King next turned to relationships with Spain. He pointed out that the
                            Spanish do not want to fight, nor does Morocco want to fight. He
                            emphasized that if Spain leaves the Sahara Morocco will not permit a
                            vacuum and would fight against any independence movement (which he
                            speculated might be even Chinese instigated) but not against Spain. He
                            smiled and said there were two reasons he would not fight against Spain,
                            the first one being that Spain was stronger and the second one that they
                            must live as neighbors. He said there would be some border actions, no
                            doubt, as there had been in the past, but he considered those as actions
                            of statecraft aimed at public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The King said even though he had 50 years experience practicing
                            subversion against France, he was not an aggressor and he hoped very
                            much for our continued assistance. He stated that he was a man of his
                            word, as everyone knows, and that in case of a conflict in the Middle
                            East he would be with America, although he could not take that position
                            publicly. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> provided arms would not be
                            used by Morocco in the Mid East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> then told the King
                            that he had spent many years in the Middle East countries and knew them
                            quite well. He stated that he personally expected an accommodation
                            shortly, which would stabilize the Middle East situation. He went on to
                            say that all parties now agreed that there was no military solution
                            possible, that it must be a political settlement. Because of this and
                            other factors, he anticipated a signifi<pb n="185" facs="0212"
                                xml:id="pg_185"/>cant accommodation in the next 60 to 90 days. Not a
                            settlement—but progress. He went on to say that there were very
                            disturbing elements in the general region. In Iraq there was significant
                            Russian presence. In Libya <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> was stirring the pot in every direction and
                            being very worrisome to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> told King Hassan
                            that he had discussed Algeria with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRG_1">Neumann</persName> that morning and had told him
                            of his own misgivings with respect to the current regime. He was
                            concerned with the significant Soviet presence there, both in a hardware
                            and political sense. He believes there is a spirit of revolution in
                            Algeria and is not sure at all about the direction that spirit might
                            lead. He suspected it could go further left which could create a very
                            bad situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> then observed that
                            when he reports to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> the King’s uneasiness and the possibility of a coup
                            in Algeria, the first question will be, “What direction will the coup
                            take?”</p>
                        <p>His Majesty replied, “You can be sure it will go to the right.
                            Definitely. American interests with respect to gas and energy will be
                            aided by this.” The King continued, “I know what I am talking
                            about.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> responded that he
                            respected the King’s judgment very much and was confident that he knew
                            whereof he spoke.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty then remarked that the United States should cultivate the
                            Vice President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti, more. He has a new
                            look and is not a classical Baathist. He settled the difficulties with
                            Iran and wants to reapproach the West. This must be done slowly and
                            carefully. Not everyone has the courage of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>. Iraq has for 15 years been against the United
                            States. One needs courage to try to change that policy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> on the other hand is a man of his
                            word. He is a gentleman’s agreement. You can try to get closer to Iraq
                            through Iran and others, “not directly.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> commented that
                            Prince Fahd could help.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty said that would be good, and continued that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was not mad. He was a boy who
                            needed to be taken in hand. He remarked that Egypt does not want him. He
                            is dangerous. However, he pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_JAA_1"
                                >Jalud</persName> was no less dangerous. The most intelligent man in
                            Libya he considered to be Minister of Foreign Affairs ‘<persName
                                corresp="#p_HAAA_1">Abd-al-Munim-al-Huni</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The King next reflected on the Mediterranean littoral and commented that
                            North Africa begins at the Suez. Egypt—he classes as neither red nor
                            green but in the process of changing. Libya—he said Soviet relations
                            were excellent with Libya; the Libyans had many Soviet technicians and
                            arms and wanted a nuclear manufacturing center. Libya—he termed as red
                            and becoming redder. Tunisia—he classed as green. Algeria—he termed red.
                            He remarked that Algeria was the last of the <pb n="186" facs="0213"
                                xml:id="pg_186"/>agrarian reform countries and that he was concerned
                            since there were many French consultants in Algeria planting a hard
                            Marxist doctrine. For this reason he thought the opposition had a good
                            chance in Algeria. Morocco—he classed as green. The King next stated
                            that it was important that the two red countries be kept from getting
                            together otherwise the green ones of Tunisia and Morocco would be
                            endangered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> at this time
                            returned to the discussion of the military and remarked that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> tanks had been rushed to Morocco at the
                            express request of the Moroccan government. The King interjected that he
                            knew we took those from our own Army, because of our desire to assist
                            them. The Moroccan Army does not know that they came from our own Army
                            however. It is a “staff secret”. It is better that the Moroccan Army
                            does not know they came from your Army. The King next went briefly over
                            the list which he had presented to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clements</persName>, emphasizing that in the future they wanted
                            tanks with new guns and the latest capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said that now that
                            we know what you want, “I promise that I will do what I can.”</p>
                        <p>His Majesty said, “That is sufficient. I will remain quiet.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said while he was
                            personally favorable he was but one voice, to which the King replied, “A
                            very important voice.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> said, he must talk
                            to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and he would do
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The King answered that he was “calm” because they were friends of his,
                            and then stated it would help if certain equipments could be expedited.
                            “I know you have many orders but we would appreciate it if you could
                            expedite this list”, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                                >Clements</persName> replied, “We will try.”</p>
                        <p>The King said you know this is not just a commercial affair, our prestige
                            and presence are riding on it. It may not seem important to the United
                            States, with the various countries in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> or even Latin America to think about.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> assured the King
                            that he wanted him to completely understand that the United States
                            thinks Morocco is important. No South American country could compare in
                            importance in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> view.</p>
                        <p>The King said when the Middle East problem was settled, nothing would
                            impede Morocco’s offering bases to the United States to cover problems
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> might be having with Portugal and
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>In an aside, he commented that he wanted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to come see him on the next trip even though
                            it were a “technical” stop.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> next brought up the
                            subject of nuclear powered ship visits to Morocco.</p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_187"/>
                        <p>His Majesty stated that public opinion was crazy; the public thinks
                            nuclear ships could explode at any moment. He suggested that, if a visit
                            were to occur, it should start with a civilian nuclear powered ship. (He
                            noted Morocco had forbidden German and Japanese nuclear powered ships to
                            visit when they asked for visits to Casablanca.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> replied that our
                            nuclear powered merchant ship the Savannah was no longer operating to
                            which His Majesty replied, “Ask the Germans to send theirs”. When it
                            called, he would have the Minister visit it and the rumors would be
                            wiped out. He did not want to start nuclear powered visits with
                            warships.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded with pleasantries and an exchange of gifts.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have delivered 28 M48A3 tanks to Morocco as part of the Moroccan force
                            modernization program. The tanks are currently located at Casablanca.
                            Recently the Moroccans, who do not have tank transporters, requested our
                            aid in moving the tanks to Oujda in the northeast of the country near
                            the Algerian border. State was about to agree when the Moroccans
                            suddenly changed the desired destination of the tanks to Ksah el-Souk,
                            200 km southeast of Casablanca.</p>
                        <p>In this location the tanks would not be available for use in Spanish
                            Sahara, but would be strategically located to prevent possible Algerian
                            incursion into Morocco. However, State feels that the strategic niceties
                            of the situation would be lost on international opinion, and if we
                            acceded to the Moroccan request to move the tanks south we would be <pb

                            encouragement to Moroccan plans to take the Spanish Sahara by force.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, State plans to refuse the Moroccan request, but to delay
                            refusal until after the visit of Assistant Secretary <persName

                        <p>1. We realize final curtain has not yet fallen on Spanish Sahara drama.
                            Nevertheless, enough of the act has already been played out to enable us
                            to accept King Hassan’s argument that Morocco’s relations with Spain are
                            on a sound footing and even to accept as plausible his insistence that
                            there is an affinity of interests between the two countries that will be
                            broadened and expanded in period to come. This emergence of a friendly
                            and cooperative relationship between two countries, both friendly to
                            U.S., that straddle the Straits of Gibraltar is incontestably very much
                            in the United States’ regional interests. Meanwhile, relief of earlier
                            action accompanying ongoing <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Spanish
                            base negotiations has also helped clear the air.</p>
                        <p>2. Embassy believes it is now time for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to set aside recent doubts and reservations and
                            proceed, steadily and firmly, to implement the Moroccan military
                            modernization program. We are not arguing for major new departures, but
                            rather for going ahead during planned time frame of next three–four
                            years with what we already <pb n="189" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_189"/>have
                            determined to do, as well as acting upon existing Moroccan requests that
                            are not yet approved. This program, it will be recalled, is designed not
                            to upset strategic balance with Algeria, but rather to help toward
                            restoring it. We firmly believe this program will contribute to regional
                            stability in the process. Any backing off or protracted delay on our
                            part, on the other hand, would contribute to Moroccan military weak-ness
                            and could only engender power vacuum here that would tempt not only
                            Algeria, but potentially also <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            (which has not been show-ing notable restraint elsewhere as regards
                            intervention in regional disputes).</p>
                        <p>3. One outstanding case in point at this time is the pending Moroccan
                            request for a letter of offer for F–5E/F aircraft (<gloss
                                target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> A). We strongly recommend moving
                            ahead on this item immediately.</p>
                        <p>4. We have taken note of Dept’s general concern, e.g., as expressed in
                            final paragraph of <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> B, that in
                            meeting Morocco’s perceived needs for modern military equipment within
                            envisioned limits, we may be encouraging Moroccans to undertake a strain
                            on their payment capabilities that their general resource outlook may
                            not justify. We plan a detailed submission on this issue in near future.
                            For the moment, wish note following key points:</p>
                        <p>A. Basic decision on priority Morocco should give arms purchases is
                            Moroccans’, not ours. We can rest assured that as long as they feel
                            menaced by hostile neighbor their own priorities will put guns ahead of
                            butter. Ergo, Moroccans are going to get arms somewhere, whatever the
                            impact on developmental and other priorities. In this aspect of military
                            supply relationship, we see our role as essentially that of advising
                            Moroccans as to how modernization program can be most prudently and
                            economically implemented in context of established U.S. and Moroccan
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>B. Foreign exchange position for Morocco over next couple of years is
                            admittedly tight (Rabat 4870, para 3). Longer term recovery of demand
                            for phosphates and solid borrowing prospects to bridge current market
                            softening bodes well for Moroccan solvency. We have, moreover, reason to
                            believe that Moroccans are justified in expectations that oil-rich
                            friendly Arab governments, notably Saudi Arabia, willing and able to
                            foot a good bit of the bill for Moroccan military modernization
                            program.</p>
                        <p>5. Recommendation: We therefore recommend that <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> without delay proceed with implementation of military
                            modernization program and, in particular, take immediate steps to
                            furnish letter of offer for F–5E/F aircraft. We have been hearing from
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> that Moroccan Air Force
                            perceives a need for these aircraft with shortest possible delivery
                            time. Positive sign from us would be especially welcome to <gloss

                        <p>278. For the Secretary from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NRG_1"
                                >Neumann</persName>. Subject: U.S. Arms Delivery to Morocco: Action
                            on Requested F–5 Aircraft. Ref: Rabat 122, Rabat 121, Rabat 123, Rabat

                        <p>1. However sound reasons may be for protracted holdup in Department’s
                            clearance, I fear any further delay may be interpreted by King as signal
                            that he had best look elsewhere for support in what he sees as
                            long-range, cold war type struggle against an Algerian rival backed by
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. I am convinced that for many
                            reasons, including your own efforts to bring peace in the Middle East,
                            this would have many consequences seriously adverse to long-range as
                            well as short-term U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>2. While I am most reluctant to personalize this policy issue, you should
                            know that I have received various signals from several good Moroccan
                            sources that King was surprised by decision to change Chiefs of Mission
                            here; and in typically oriental fashion may be construing it as possibly
                            signaling change in U.S. policy. Naturally I wish to do whatever I can
                            to help see that the turnover is accomplished in whatever way best
                            supports U.S. bilateral and regional interests. I would be most
                            distressed should the King take <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            failure to act on the F–5’s and pending ambassadorial change as mutually
                            reinforcing bits of evidence to confirm his concern that he cannot count
                            on U.S. support. While I wish to do what I can to avoid this, actions
                            speak louder than words and nothing I could possibly say at this end
                            would be as useful as affirmative action now on the F–5’s.</p>

                            Schaufele and <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> we

                                >GOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss> in light of
                            current developments in Sahara and concerns expressed by Amembassies

                        <p>3. Action on these requests has been delayed during <gloss

                            appeared there might be a conflict between Morocco and Spain. With
                            conclusion tripartite agreement and <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss>
                            withdrawal from Sahara, we are taking fresh look at <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> requests. Embassy Rabat argues we
                            should be forthcoming with <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> since it
                            is part of long range program conceived in 1973 for steady upgrading of
                            currently weak <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> military
                            capabilities and is not designed to reverse current heavy military
                            predominance of Algeria but to move Morocco toward something approaching
                            parity. Embassy believes our broader interests are better served by
                            supporting a friend than by demonstrating great concern for possible
                            reactions of consist<pb n="192" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_192"/>ent
                            adversary. It is also noted that initial deliveries of F–5’s and <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOWs</gloss> not possible before mid-1977 and
                            1981, respectively.</p>
                        <p>4. Embassy Algiers concerned that resumption of delayed arms sales to
                            Morocco (even if deliveries of some items not imminent) would be
                            interpreted by <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> as support for
                            Moroccan territorial expansion and abandonment of our proclaimed
                            neutrality on Sahara. It also fears it will heighten <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> confidence, thereby increasing chance
                            of armed conflict with Algeria, and may involve us in open ended
                            commitment to <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> if its ventures lead
                            it into difficulties. Embassy suggests that long-standing military
                            supply commitments to <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> be honored
                            but urges that we not take exceptional and highly visible measures to
                            accelerate <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> buildup until Sahara
                            situation clarifies.</p>
                        <p>5. Earlier <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> requests for the REDEYE
                            were refused on grounds that it no longer is in production and is in
                            short supply in our own forces. Moroccans are also aware of our concern
                            that weapons could fall into terrorist hands, but insist there is no
                            such threat in Morocco and that they would be satisfied with token
                            number. We have denied REDEYE to all Mideast countries except Israel,
                            Saudi Arabia, and <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName> as
                            matter of policy and feel no exception should be made for Morocco.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss> asked our Ambassador for <gloss

                        <p>7. We agreed that Algeria, already convinced that we back the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>, undoubtedly will be irritated by any
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms deliveries or sales
                            commitments to Morocco. However, we believe that we should follow a
                            deliberate policy of doing enough for Morocco to reassure the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> that we intend to proceed with our
                            long-term program, as conceived in late 1973, for gradually upgrading
                            its military capabilities. At the same time, reasonable care should be
                            taken with scheduling of deliveries to avoid intensifying Algerian
                            apprehension by giving impression we are engaging in major escalation of
                            pace and content of our military supplies to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>8. We seek your concurrence with following recommendations which we
                            believe will achieve these objectives:</p>
                        <p>A. Immediately approve submission to Congress of letter of offer
                            totalling $135 million for the purchase by the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> of 20 F–5E and 4F–5F aircraft (initial deliveries would
                            be in mid-1977).</p>
                        <p>B. Provide price and availability data on 12 <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss>-equipped Cobra helicopters (initial deliveries of
                            helicopters possible in slightly over one year from order with <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> deliveries projected in 1981).</p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_193"/>
                        <p>C. Since F–5A aircraft which <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> wishes
                            are not available, authorize <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> to
                            pursue with <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> discussions concerning
                            possibility of furnishing rebuilt Navy F–8s to Morocco (deliveries would
                            be possible in 12 months).</p>
                        <p>D. Refuse to sell REDEYE missile to the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>E. Do not make special effort to accelerate delivery schedules for items
                            intended for Morocco except for sample units which can be used as
                            training models prior to arrival of the remainder of the items.</p>
                        <p>F. We also seek your concurrence in our recommendation that an export
                            license be approved for a commercial sale of 200 heavy machine guns and
                            ammunition to the Mauritanian Government.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has prepared notification to Congress of two
                            pending sales to Morocco: the sale of 20 F–5E and four F–5F aircraft
                            valued at $135.0 million, and 8260 DRAGON missiles and launchers costing
                            $57.4 million. The State Department has asked for our decision before
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s meeting
                            with a personal emmissary from King Hassan on January 29.</p>
                        <p>Although delivery of the F–5s will not begin for 22 months, and DRAGON
                            delivery is even further in the future, these sales must be considered
                            in light of the ongoing Sahara dispute. Algeria can be ex<pb n="194"
                                facs="0221" xml:id="pg_194"/>pected to be irritated and may
                            interpret the sale—in spite of the long lead times—as a weakening of our
                            announced policy of evenhandedness in the Sahara. We do not believe,
                            however, that this Algerian reaction justifies imposing delays on major
                            weapon procurement for future delivery which is a constituent element of
                            our ongoing arms relationship with Morocco, as long as we take no
                            extraordinary steps to expedite deliveries. Moreover, we doubt there
                            will be substantial Congressional opposition to the sale when it is
                            explained that deliveries are two years off. Accordingly, we recommend
                            going ahead with notification to Congress; we would plan to ask State
                            not to send these cases to the Hill in the period immediately preceding
                            the February recess; this will satisfy Congressional desire for 20 days
                            outside of recess to consider this case, and will give us the option of
                            reconsidering notification if fighting flares in the Sahara
                            meanwhile.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has approved
                            the F–5 notification. We understand the DRAGON notification will be
                            decided at the Assistant Secretary level, with staff level recommending
                            notification.</p>

                        <p>1. Immediately following telegram contains message from King to Secretary
                            for delivery to President. King dictated message to me in his office
                            evening February 8, following his conversation with secret Moroccan
                            mission which arrived here this afternoon from Iran. Mission <pb n="195"
                                facs="0222" xml:id="pg_195"/>headed by Chief Moroccan Air Force.
                            Mission presented King with request for military aid and reported
                            results conversation with SAH.</p>
                        <p>2. King is impressed with urgent need for military support in Morocco and
                            says he believes Moroccan claims that Soviets and Libyans are pouring in
                            weapons. Crux of King’s request is to help him honor Moroccan plea for
                            25 F–5A’s and 36 106 mm recoilless rifles. King willing to provide
                            latter without seeking replacement. Shah says he will give 4 or 5 F–5A’s
                            on condition they appear to come from <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2"
                                >Jordan</persName> and that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> gives
                            its agreement to the transfer. King says he will cooperate. In addition
                            he says he is willing to transfer 20 of the F–5A given him recently by
                            the Shah to Morocco immediately. However he wants us to provide him as
                            soon as possible with replacements in kind or some equivalent number of
                            F–5E’s. He would not transfer of course unless we gave permission which
                            is required under the existing agreement with us concerning these
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>3. Moroccans have asked for additional items of equipment which are
                            included in a list which I will provide in a later para (para 7) of this
                            cable. Shah has said he will also provide munitions for the F–5A he
                            wishes to transfer “through” <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2"
                                >Jordan</persName>. Finally King asks for advise and assistance on
                            getting aircraft to Morocco expeditiously.</p>
                        <p>4. After King dictated his letter we talked for a few minutes. I told him
                            that my own personal reaction was that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> would not have funds or aircraft to replace the F–5A he
                            was considering sending to Morocco. Did the Moroccans indicate they
                            could pay for them? He said he thought that was possible they would do
                            so. King in that case would like some sort of high priority on the
                            delivery of additional F–5E’s. He was aware because I told him that one
                            for one replacement would not be very likely because of the differences
                            in cost. I believe he would be happy indeed to be able to convert the
                            F–5A’s into E’s at something less than a one for one trade off. He also
                            talked about seeing the Shah soon and trying to find out whether the
                            Shah could help finance the deal. This I very much doubt since the Shah
                            gave the aircraft to <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName> in
                            the first place. He is thus not very likely to turn around and pay for
                            the replacements for his gift. The King mentioned the Saudis as a
                            possible source of help and said he might consider going through Saudi
                            Arabia if he visits Iran. He also indicates in his letter to the
                            Secretary that he will be in touch with the Saudis.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, the King mentioned Syria. He said that that Asad told him
                            last month that he would like to stay out of the middle of the Saharan
                            problem if he could especially since he was trying to be a mediator. But
                            if it were necessary for him to declare himself he could not turn his
                            back on Morocco after what the Moroccans had done to help him in October

                            move the aircraft and that his friend Juan Carlos in Spain <pb n="196"
                                facs="0223" xml:id="pg_196"/>would also be counted upon similarly to
                            help Moroccans. King also asked whether there was anything we could do
                            from our assets in Europe to help quickly. I did not leave much
                            encouragement on that point.</p>
                        <p>6. Of the remaining items on the list King said he was either woefully
                            short or completely out of the items mentioned. While I was in the
                            office he called Chief of Staff Bin Shaker to check again that 106 mm
                            recoilless rifles could be spared. Moroccans he said had indicated they
                            had been in touch with <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and they were
                            trying to speed up our regular program of military aid.</p>

                            He reports that Moroccans shortly expect to be in an area where Algerian

                        <p>1. King called me to his office evening Feb 8 (<gloss
                                target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) and dictated following message
                            to Secretary.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text: Dear Mr. Secretary I hope, sir, that you will convey the
                            following message to the President with my respects and regards. I have
                            just received a special high-level emissary from His Majesty King Hassan
                            the Second of Morocco, accompanied by the Moroccan Air Force Commander.
                            They brought me the King’s assessment, with which I concur, regarding
                            the real threat which the Moroccans feel exists to their country and to
                            the Republic of Mauritania, surrounded as they are by radical regimes. I
                            can also appreciate the Moroccans’ concern that their Algerian neighbors
                            are playing for time during which they continue to receive military aid
                            and financial support from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            and others, including Libya. It seems all the more urgent, while
                            watching the Angolan tragedy, which is a living example of what may
                            happen elsewhere, to look at the list of military equipment Morocco
                            seeks to obtain “now” (King asked that this word be underlined) to
                            thwart a developing threat before it is too late. The Moroccan
                            delegation arrived from Tehran where his Imperial Majesty has provided
                            all available equipment on condition that Iranian contacts with your
                            government secure your permission for its release to Morocco and that
                            such equipment would have to go by way of <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2"
                                >Jordan</persName> to Morocco and not appear to be provided directly
                            by Iran. We do not mind this in the least. But I believe that Morocco
                            and Iran also expect us to furnish some 20 F–5A aircraft originally
                            given to us by Iran in order to make up the Moroccan requirement of 25
                            aircraft. In this regard, we would need a definite commitment from your
                            government to replace these aircraft with the same type and number, or
                            with F–5E’s which are preferable, in the nearest possible future, as
                            their loss would leave us with only one squadron of F–5A’s for training
                            while continuing the process of standardizing our Air Force on the F–5E
                            type. Beyond that, we seek your permission to supply the 36 106mm
                            recoilless rifles which Morocco requires. Unfortunately, there is little
                            else we can spare at this point, as most of the other required items on
                            the Moroccan list are either unavailable to us, or barely so. I shall be
                            in constant touch with His Imperial Majesty while awaiting your
                            response. And if it is favorable we will wish to determine with you the
                            best way of conveying all of these weapons to Morocco at the earliest
                            possible time. I intend also to advise our Saudi brethren on these
                            developments and I hope that your government can help us all in carrying
                            the load to meet the Moroccan requirements. With my respects, regards
                            and best wishes to the President and your good self, Sincerely, Hussein
                            I. End text.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>According to the Iranians and Jordanians, the Moroccan Government has
                            sent a special Mission to both countries seeking rapid supply of
                            military equipment. The types and quantities of equipment the Moroccans
                            seek are reasonable and include nothing except REDEYES that we should
                            have any doubts about supplying; the principal issue is the political
                            one of visibly accelerated delivery through third-country transfers.</p>
                        <p>Both the Iranian and Jordanian Governments have told us, and presumably
                            have told the Moroccans, that they would be prepared to transfer to
                            Morocco from their own inventories a considerable amount of
                            U.S.-supplied equipment. A U.S. decision is required on three aspects of
                            such an operation: (1) whether to authorize some or all of the
                            third-country transfers involved; (2) whether and when we could replace
                            these items in the Iranian and Jordanian inventories, as these
                            governments have requested; and (3) whether and how we could help move
                            the equipment to Morocco. Involved in the question of replacement is
                            also the complex problem of payment for any items furnished Jordan and
                            Iran as replacements.</p>
                        <p>You will want to consider these three issues in the context of more
                            fundamental questions: (1) on the one hand, to what extent do we want to
                            appear to be internationalizing the Sahara dispute through visible
                            emergency supply of U.S. equipment during the forthcoming period <pb

                            February 28; (2) on the other hand, how do we signal to King Hassan and
                            his supporters that we are not indifferent to the fact that Morocco is
                            under-armed while its adversaries (Algeria and Libya) are well-armed by
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Our interests in this situation are to see the Moroccan solution to the
                            Sahara dispute succeed, if possible while permitting Algeria to save
                            face if it wishes to and avoiding a confrontation with the Soviets which
                            would escalate the cost of success to us and risk another Angola-type
                            debate with Congress.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>King Hassan has sent a mission to Iran and <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2"
                                >Jordan</persName> requesting the transfer to Morocco of U.S.
                            equipment in their inventories. The Iranian and Jordanian Governments
                            have been sympathetic and have asked us whether we would give the
                            necessary authorization. Hassan has painted a picture of a growing
                            Algerian threat, backed by large-scale shipments of arms from the Soviet
                            Union and Libya. He has claimed that the Algerians are being assisted in
                            their Sahara operations by Cubans and North Vietnamese, and draws a
                            parallel between the Sahara and Angola. His aim appears clearly to
                            enlist support by presenting the Sahara problem as a U.S.-Soviet
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of all the information now available to us, we are skeptical
                            that the Sahara question has—as yet, at least—taken on this
                            international complexion. The Algerians are being supplied with
                            considerable quantities of military equipment by the Soviets, possibly
                            in the neighborhood of $400–500 million, as well as direct shipments of
                            Soviet arms from Libya. Some of this equipment is, in turn, being used
                            by the Algerians in backing the Polisario guerrilla forces in the
                            Sahara, but it is far from clear that the Soviets see themselves at this
                            point actively and specifically committed to the Algerian/Polisario
                            position in the Sahara dispute. There is evidence, in fact, that they
                            wish to avoid this, partly in order to maintain their modest
                            relationship with Morocco. It is nonetheless true that Algeria is much
                            better armed than Morocco, though its capacity to bring this superiority
                            to bear in the Sahara is apparently limited by distances and transport
                            problems. It is also true that the Soviets, if forced to choose, would
                            come down on the Algerian/Polisario side.</p>
                        <p>The most marked characteristic of the Sahara dispute at this time,
                            however, is the degree to which it is being dealt with as a regional
                            problem, in which King Hassan has so far outwitted his adversaries and
                            kept Arab opinion from crystallizing against him. <gloss

                            representatives, differing only in the way this was to be accomplished.
                            Under the Tripartite arrangement, the Saharan Assembly (Yamaa) created
                            by the Spanish colonial authorities, was to serve as the voice of

                            effect. (Amman 688—Attachment 1.) In particular, the King stated that he

                            recently given him by Iran. In return, the Jordanians would hope to
                            receive, on a one-for-one basis, the more expensive and sophisticated
                            F–5E’s that Morocco expects to receive from us (the Jordanians said
                            15–18 months from now, but the actual wait is closer to 20 months for
                            the first delivery). Receiving new F–5E’s for old F–5A’s is very
                            attractive to <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>—about a 15
                            to 1 return as an F–5E costs over $3 million and a used F–5A is worth
                            about $200,000. The Jordanians offered to provide Morocco with 106 mm.

                            states that the Jordanians are likely to ask whether we could provide an

                        <p>The Iranian Foreign Minister informed Ambassador <persName

                            requested our agreement. The Iranians did not want to do so directly, he
                            said, but desired to have <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>

                            if we could replace this equipment quickly in the Iranian inventory,
                            except for 4 or 5 F–5A’s for which the Shah would not request
                            replacements from the Moroccan order of F–5E’s.</p>
                        <p>We have subsequently ascertained that, of the equipment requested by the
                            Moroccans, the Iranians could supply all that the Jordanians have not
                            expressed a willingness to provide except REDEYES, and you have already
                            decided we should not further proliferate REDEYES by providing them to
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>In considering the following options, certain practical logistical and
                            financial considerations are relevant:</p>
                        <p>—Any transfers of U.S.-supplied equipment from Jordan and Iran to Morocco
                            must be notified to Congress. Such transfers will therefore be public
                            knowledge, and the speed with which they can be effected will depend not
                            only on availability, condition of equipment, and transport and
                            financing arrangements, but also on the speed with which the
                            legislatively-required assurances and notifications can be moved through
                            the Moroccan, Jordanian, Iranian and U.S. bureaucracies.</p>
                        <p>—One reason for Morocco’s seeking these items of equipment from Jordan
                            and Iran is that, due to our own force requirements, other commitments
                            and production lead-times, we cannot provide them as quickly as Morocco
                            wishes. We therefore cannot provide rapid replacements to Jordan and
                            Iran; their role would be precisely to absorb the delays Morocco faces
                            in getting these items directly from us—although there are corollary
                            political benefits in Morocco’s being able to demonstrate in this way
                            the support it has from Hussein and the Shah.</p>
                        <p>—Replacement costs will exceed the original costs to Iran and Jordan of
                            any items transferred to Morocco, and we have no funds to absorb
                            them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Options</p>
                        <p>There are three obvious general options:</p>
                        <p>Option 1 – Agree to the transfer of as much equipment as can be made
                            available as quickly as feasible.</p>
                        <p>Option 2 – Not agree to any transfer.</p>
                        <p>Option 3 – Agree to a selective transfer operation, perhaps staged over a
                            period of several months.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are choices with respect to U.S. assistance in
                            transporting any equipment being moved and with respect to replacement
                            of transferred items.</p>

                            and Mauritania will take over the former colony, dividing it between
                            them. We thus have an interest in seeing that Morocco is militarily
                            capable of carrying out this operation against Algerian-supported
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>—If Algeria were to succeed in frustrating Moroccan plans, it would be
                            seen to some degree at least as a success for Soviet-backed forces over
                            the side supported by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>—It is at least possible that Algeria would be restrained from becoming
                            more deeply involved if it saw active support for Morocco by the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>—Hassan obviously feels exposed in the face of potential Algerian power,
                            and any substantial assistance of this kind would have an important
                            psychological effect for him, as well as military consequences. Not to
                            provide any assistance, in the face of his determined efforts to acquire
                            it, would be very discouraging to him and would lead him to question the
                            value of his relationship with the U.S. Since the Iranians and
                            Jordanians are also deeply involved, they would be led as well to wonder
                            how reliable the U.S. was in this sense. The same might also be said of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and Asad, both of whom
                            lean toward Morocco on the Sahara issue and would oppose any Algerian
                            military initiative.</p>

                        <p>—It does not appear, as yet at least, that the Soviet Union wishes to
                            become deeply involved in supporting an Algerian operation in the
                            Sahara, although the Soviets have continued to provide large amounts of
                            modern equipment to Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—Visible support from the U.S., in the form of our agreement to the
                            transfer from our friends of substantial quantities of arms, could put
                            the Soviets in a position where they would be obliged to be politically
                            more partisan and more active.</p>
                        <p>—There is at least as much chance that Algeria would see our action as a
                            provocation as there is that they would be deterred by it. Our
                            relationship with Algeria would certainly suffer, and the Algerians
                            might well consider it necessary to respond by making their support for
                            the Polisario more visible and more effective.</p>
                        <p>—We very much hope that regional efforts, and the activity of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> representative, will damp down the
                            dispute, if not actually resolve it. For us to be involved, at this
                            juncture, with a highly visible arms supply operation that Hassan would
                            almost certainly publicize, could seriously embarrass both the regional
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> efforts. It could lead the
                            Moroccans to be much less conciliatory and could lead the Algerians to
                            refuse cooperation.</p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_204"/>
                        <p>—The official date for Spanish withdrawal and administrative turnover of
                            the territory to Morocco and Mauritania is February 28. Particularly
                            since the Moroccans have not complied with the provision of both <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions calling for some
                            determination of the wishes of the Saharan population, this date could
                            be a focus of considerable political tension. Even the announcement of
                            large supplies of military equipment to be provided in the near future,
                            as distinct from actual shipment, could heighten this tension.</p>
                        <p>—In general, regardless of the military merits and of what specific
                            reactions it might bring, a highly visible and rapid supply of American
                            equipment would tend to emphasize the big-power, international aspects
                            of the dispute and would work against any hope of keeping it largely
                            regional in scope.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option 2: Do not agree to any arms transfers.</p>
                        <p>The Pros and Cons are essentially those of Option 1, reversed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option 3: Agree to transfer of selective
                            quantities and types of arms, perhaps stretching out the transfers over
                            a period of time.</p>

                        <p>—This would provide some evidence of support for Hassan and would
                            increase his actual capacity to conduct his operation in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—If the quantities were limited enough, or stretched out enough in time,
                            the initial impact would not be as disruptive on regional efforts or as
                            likely to give a big-power cast to the Sahara problem.</p>
                        <p>—In actual fact, such a transfer operation would probably require
                            considerable time and it would be better to make this clear in the very
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>—We would have time to assess the progress of regional and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> attempts at solution, to see whether the
                            Soviets become more directly involved, and to observe the extent to
                            which the Algerians intend to prosecute the conflict in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">CONS:</hi></p>
                        <p>—Hassan would be somewhat let down, since it would be difficult to
                            prevent his knowing that it was the U.S. that restrained the Iranians
                            and Jordanians.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. hesitancy could be interpreted in some quarters as an indication of
                            the lack of U.S. resolve and might encourage the Algerians, with Soviet
                            backing, to risk further military confrontations with the Moroccans.</p>

                        <p>Whether or not there is a real issue here depends on how much equipment
                            we authorize for transfer, and how quickly we would like it transferred.
                            If we want a substantial amount of matériel moved rapidly, we probably
                            have little alternative but to provide some air lift in addition to
                            whatever the Jordanians can provide. Otherwise the two Jordanian C–130s
                            might suffice, particularly if any F–5A’s to be transferred are
                            themselves flown to Morocco. Other Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi
                            Arabia or Iraq might also assist with an airlift.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Financing</p>
                        <p>Further study will be needed, depending on how much and what kind of
                            equipment we permit to be transferred. Any replacement equipment we
                            provide will certainly cost more. The difference will be particularly
                            marked with respect to the F–5E’s, if the Moroccans agree to use them to
                            replace the F–5A’s on a one-for-one basis, and if we authorize the
                            transfer of the F–5A’s. In this case, the least complicated method would
                            seem to be to continue with the supply of the F–5E’s to Morocco, with
                            Morocco to pay as planned, and to authorize Morocco to transfer them to
                                <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>The Defense Department is examining the practical problems of
                            availability and cost on an urgent basis, particularly with regard to
                            aircraft. Meanwhile, there are too many unknowns and variables to permit
                            a hard and fast decision to permit transfer of a specific number of
                            items in a specific time period. In principle, however, while I believe
                            that we will want to support Hassan by authorizing some early transfers,
                            it would seem prudent to have the transfer of any substantial amounts
                            spread out over a reasonable period of time (e.g., 30–90 days) to reduce
                            the visibility and hence the political disadvantages. This is
                            particularly true of the aircraft—the most dramatic and visible of the
                            equipment. We believe, on the basis of initial <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> estimates, that the aircraft would take some time to
                            put in shape for the trip, so that would be a natural delaying factor.
                            If we did not agree to a U.S. airlift—and I would recommend against it
                            as constituting too dramatic a U.S. involvement in the Sahara
                            problem—that would also necessitate spaced-out delivery. I suggest,
                            therefore, that we authorize immediate transfer of some equipment, such
                            as the howitzers and 106 mm. recoilless rifles and ammunition, and say
                            that we are studying the other requests urgently. Given the process for
                            such transfers, we could probably not complete the authorization in less
                            than three to four weeks. (Under existing legislation, we cannot approve
                            third party transfers of <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> origin U.S. military equipment until
                            Congress has been informed and transfer assurances obtained from the
                            proposed recipient.) We <pb n="206" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_206"/>could
                            then discuss with the Jordanians how long it would take to move the
                            aircraft, how this should be done, and how the replacement would be
                            handled (we would need to talk to the Moroccans directly about that). By
                            that time, we should have a clearer picture of the developing Sahara
                            problem, and would be able to decide whether and under what conditions
                            to approve transfer of the planes.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Iran’s desire to have the equipment it provides pass
                            through Jordan, we can agree to that but should warn the Iranians that,
                            given our procedures for reporting all transfers to Congress, the
                            operation will be quite transparent and the Iranian role will be
                            evident. We will have to warn the Iranians, furthermore, that early
                            replacement of the equipment will probably not be possible, given the
                            long lead-times involved (just as it has not been possible for us to
                            further accelerate deliveries to Morocco directly). Finally, we will
                            want to warn both Iran and Jordan that the transfers will certainly
                            become public and might well attract considerable attention.</p>
                        <p>If you agree with the following recommendations, we shall draft replies
                            to the Jordanians and Iranians for your approval.</p>

                        <p>2. That we inquire of the Jordanians about the practical problems

                            equipment be replaced in their inventory and are studying the

                            replace Jordanian F–5A’s with the more costly F–5E’s.</p>
                        <p>7. That, if the Jordanians raise the subject, we say we do not believe we
                            can make available the aircraft to transport the equipment to
                            Morocco.</p>

                                >Sisco</persName>. Subject: Action Memorandum—Visit to Morocco of
                            U.S. Nuclear-Powered Submarine (S/S 7603250).</p>
                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>A visit by U.S. nuclear-powered submarine, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bergall,</hi> to south central Moroccan port of Safi is scheduled
                            for February 27 to March 1. This would be first visit by a U.S.
                            Nuclear-Powered Warship (<gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss>) to a
                            Moroccan port and could attract unusual attention as it would coincide
                            with February 28 transfer of Spanish juridical authority in Sahara, a
                            time when Morocco will be the focus of considerable diplomatic and press
                            activity. We need to weigh pros and cons of allowing visit to proceed on
                            schedule and, if visit goes forward, we need also to consider advance
                            notification of those Arab nations, particularly Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
                            Syria, which have been attempting to bring about solution to Sahara
                            problem, and Algeria in order to defuse <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s adverse reaction to the extent
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>1. After several months of <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            indecision, and following direct request by Deputy Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> to Moroccan
                            Ambassador Boutaleb on December 18, <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                            >GOM</gloss>, on December 20, granted permission for U.S. nuclear
                            warships to call, at our convenience, in Moroccan ports. Moroccans, most
                            recently in January 28 meeting which I had with Ambassador Boutaleb,
                            urged we send nuclear vessel as soon as possible as demonstration of
                            U.S. support.</p>
                        <p>2. With approval of <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> Navy has made
                            arrangements for call February 27–March 1. Question is whether we should
                            allow visit to proceed or postpone it for foreign policy reasons. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> feels <pb n="208"
                                facs="0235" xml:id="pg_208"/>strongly that visit should go forward
                            as planned. He concerned that brief postponement might be indefinitely
                            prolonged, and that environment for visit is much better today than it
                            might be a month or six weeks away.</p>
                        <p>The Options</p>
                        <p>1. That you decide to postpone <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> visit for
                            brief period.</p>
                        <p>Pros</p>
                        <p>—If <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> visit should coincide with final
                            departure of Madrid’s authority from Spanish Sahara, ship’s presence
                            could be widely construed and possibly publicized by both Morocco and
                            Algeria as evidence of U.S. military support for Rabat’s policies in
                            Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—We do not want to internationalize Sahara issue, and if we send <gloss
                                target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> in now this might counter our policy
                            of keeping it regional issue and avoiding outside interference. It might
                            also leave us open to later accusations that we took first steps toward
                            internationalization of problem.</p>
                        <p>—Although there has been no move thus far for such action, Algeria or
                            another country might call for meeting of Security Council on Sahara
                            question to coincide with end of Spanish administration February 28. A
                            highly publicized U.S. Navy visit at that time would lend itself to
                            propaganda exploitation that we were seeking to influence <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> deliberations and injecting superpower
                            politics into regional dispute.</p>
                        <p>—Even if there is no SC meeting, <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                            other diplomatic efforts in train may still be underway in late
                            February. U.S. Naval visit might be seen as attempt to influence these
                            efforts. Visit might also adversely affect mediation efforts of
                            Egyptians and other moderate Arabs, or be perceived by them as
                            embarrassment to their endeavors.</p>
                        <p>—Recent events in Sahara appear to suggest that Algerians may have
                            acquiesced, at least temporarily, in the Moroccan occupation and are
                            looking for a face-saving way out of the corner they have painted
                            themselves into. Algiers could interpret U.S. <gloss target="#t_NPW_1"
                                >NPW</gloss> visit at such a sensitive time as public challenge, a
                            flaunting of U.S. support for Morocco which could not go unanswered.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is bitter about
                            our role in the Sahara dispute as he sees it, and a U.S. Naval visit to
                            Morocco could make it more difficult to maintain a U.S.-Algerian
                            dialogue, which remains important to our long run interests despite
                            Algeria’s opposition to us on a broad range of multilateral issues.</p>
                        <p>—More immediately, the <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> visit would
                            coincide with and possibly cast a shadow over Chuck Robinson’s visit to
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—We are not suggesting that the visit be cancelled but merely postponed
                            until the next date which the navy finds suitable for another nuclear
                            submarine.</p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="0236" xml:id="pg_209"/>
                        <p>Cons</p>
                        <p>—Use of Moroccan ports by U.S. <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss>’s is
                            of great important to our regional interests as at present only Italy,
                            and to lesser extent Tunisia, of all Mediterranean Basin countries, will
                            permit calls by U.S. atomic-powered warships, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>, in particular, feels
                            strongly that visit should not be postponed.</p>
                        <p>—As Moroccans have requested <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit
                            ASAP, postponement for whatever reason, and particularly after Morocco
                            has already agreed officially to proposed dates, would inevitably excite
                            Moroccan concerns and could possibly result in withdrawal of permission
                            for future <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> calls.</p>
                        <p>—Even if we disguised true reason for postponement in our explanation to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>, Moroccans would be suspicious
                            of our real motives and question our true intentions toward them.</p>
                        <p>—In your January 29 meeting with King’s Emissary Karim Lamrani, you
                            promised to think of ways to demonstrate our diplomatic and national
                            interest toward Morocco. It may be that <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi>
                            visit would constitute just such a demonstration.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. gesture in support of Morocco at this stage might be welcomed by
                            some third world friends—e.g., Iran—particularly in light of their
                            concern over Soviet activities in Angola.</p>
                        <p>—While timing of <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi>’s visit is indeed
                            awkward, the political situation in the Sahara remains uncertain and
                            there are no indications that situation would not be worse by time
                            chosen for postponed <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit.</p>
                        <p>—Although we may be able to accelerate deliveries or arrange for third
                            country transfer of some military equipment to Morocco, total package
                            will not be impressive. Though more symbolic than real, <gloss
                                target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> call coming soon after port visit of
                            Sixth Fleet Commander and his flagship might go far to reassure King
                            Hassan, who has lent us needed support on Middle East question and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> issues (although Morocco has now
                            recognized the MPLA).</p>
                        <p>Option 2</p>
                        <p>That we make no objection to visit and allow it to proceed on schedule.
                            (Arguments for and against are obverse of those above.)</p>
                        <p>Recommendations</p>
                        <p>That you authorize Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> to
                            call Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> and inform him
                            that, for reasons cited above, Department considers it not in our
                            interest to proceed with <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit as
                            scheduled and ask that visit be postponed for brief period.</p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="0237" xml:id="pg_210"/>
                        <p>Alternatively,</p>
                        <p>That we not intervene with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and allow
                            visit to proceed as planned.</p>
                        <p>Sub-options</p>
                        <p>1. If you decide <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> visit should take place
                            as scheduled, that we notify Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Syria in
                            advance to defuse to extent possible any potential adverse reaction.</p>
                        <p>Pros</p>
                        <p>—Despite lack of total success, ongoing Arab mediation efforts offer best
                            hope of settling Sahara dispute on regional basis. In absence of advance
                            notification, Arabs could perceive <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss>
                            visit as U.S. attempt to interfere or undercut their endeavors.</p>
                        <p>—On other hand, some Arab mediators may welcome <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bergall</hi> call as evidence of U.S. support for Morocco and
                            intensify their activities which stem from their own governments’
                            pro-Moroccan positions.</p>
                        <p>—If Arabs object to <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit it would
                            be better to learn this in advance so that their views could be
                            considered prior to arrival of <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> in
                            Safi.</p>
                        <p>—Arabs will appreciate advance notification as proof of continuing U.S.
                            intention to cooperate with them in matters of mutual regional
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Cons</p>
                        <p>—If Arabs object to <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> visit, we would be
                            faced with dilemma of either going ahead anyway over their objections,
                            with added strains on our relations, or postponing visit out of
                            deference to them, which could anger Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations</p>
                        <p>If you decide that <hi rend="italic">Bergall</hi> should call at Safi as
                            planned, that you authorize advance notification of Egypt, Saudi Arabia
                            and Syria, in light of their mediation efforts, and Algeria to put visit
                            in perspective to the extent possible.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively,</p>
                        <p>That we do not notify the Arab mediators prior to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit.</p>

                        <p>1. Dept and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> are giving urgent
                            consideration to <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> proposals for
                            possible transfer of items on <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            shopping list to Morocco. Action, however, complicated by many factors
                            including unavailability of early replacements, inevitability of
                            Congressional and press attention to transfers, logistical and political
                            problems associated with transport of equipment and cost factors. These
                            questions are addressed in detail below and you should discuss them with
                            appropriate <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> officials in accordance
                            with following guidelines.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. policy is basically sympathetic to Moroccan solution to Sahara
                            problem based on Spanish-Moroccan-Mauritanian Tripartite Agreement and
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> Resolution recognizing that
                            agreement for which U.S. voted in <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                            >UNGA</gloss>. We also support current mediation efforts by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General Waldheim’s
                            representative and by several Arab countries seeking to reconcile <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> differences on self-determination issue. However, we
                            recognize that military balance in area overwhelmingly in Algeria’s
                            favor, and, in view of our long-standing friendly association with
                            Morocco and concomitant military supply relationship, we want to lend
                            appropriate support. Our intention is to be as responsive as possible to
                            Morocco to help in part to offset imbalance vis-à-vis Algeria while
                            avoiding highly visible emergency supply of U.S. equipment which would
                            make it appear <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> injecting itself
                            into dispute at time that regional and <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> diplomatic efforts are in train.</p>
                        <p>3. You should inform <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> that following
                            general considerations would apply to transfers of items mentioned Ref
                            D.</p>
                        <p>A. Replacements for most items in Moroccan request list could not rpt not
                            be furnished quickly because of lengthy production lead times ranging
                            from 20 to 48 months in many cases. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            is unable to expedite these items due to firm commitments to U.S. forces
                            and other countries.</p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_212"/>
                        <p>B. Replacement costs on all items would exceed original costs to Iran,
                            and <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has no rpt no funds from which
                            to absorb added costs.</p>
                        <p>C. Responsibility for maintenance status of the equipment selected for
                            transfer must necessarily rest with countries involved.</p>
                        <p>D. Transfers of U.S. supplied equipment from Iran whether to Jordan or
                            direct to Morocco must be notified to Congress. You should be sure
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> fully understands that this
                            legislative requirement makes it inevitable that transactions will come
                            to the attention of Congress and public and might attract criticism.
                            Transfer procedures outlined in Ref E.</p>
                        <p>E. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> should submit diplomatic note or
                            other written request through <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> or
                            Ministry of Defense to Embassy formally asking authorization to effect
                            transfers in question to <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>,
                            unless they wish on reflection to transfer directly to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                            >FYI</gloss>: As you are aware, we would then need to meet statutory
                            requirements of advance notification to Congress and receipt of transfer
                            assurances from recipient. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                            >FYI</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>F. Transport of items, particularly aircraft, whether latter sent
                            directly from Iran or via Jordan, poses practical difficulties. If
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> raises question of U.S.
                            airlift, you should say you must refer question to Washington.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, you might inquire whether <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> has explored possibilities of assistance in arranging
                            airlift from Saudis and other friendly Arab states with capability.
                                (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: Transport by <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> aircraft would be very costly; rough
                            estimate around $3.7 million. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                            >FYI</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>4. Specific items: Inform <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> of
                            following:</p>
                        <p>A. 16 155 mm howitzers and ammunition—<gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> will approve transfer from Iran to Morocco, either via
                            Jordan or direct as soon as <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> statutory
                            requirements are met and arrangements can be made. Remind <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> that even if routed via Jordan,
                            transfer would eventually become public information for reasons cited
                            para 3D. Also, inform <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> that we could
                            not replace howitzers from <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> orders
                            until fourth quarter CY 77. One possibility for such transfer would be
                            to divert 12 155 howitzers now in process of being shipped from <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> port to Iran.</p>
                        <p>B. 4 or 5 F–5As with munitions (<gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> not
                            requesting replacement). In principle we favor this transfer from Iran
                            to Jordan to Morocco. If <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> should opt
                            for direct shipment, what is <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>
                            estimate of time needed to prepare planes for ferrying, or alternatively
                            to disassemble and later reassemble them in Morocco. If planes are
                            ferried, overflight and landing/refueling arrangements would have to be
                            made with Saudi Arabia, Greece, Italy and Spain. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be prepared to support <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> requests for overflight clearance.</p>
                        <p>C. We are in principle agreeable to transfer to Morocco of other items in
                            Iranian inventory but must study further the problems of re<pb n="213"
                                facs="0240" xml:id="pg_213"/>placement availability and financing.
                            This we are doing on urgent basis. Preliminary survey reveals Moroccan
                            payback based on current production/delivery schedules (LOA’s already
                            signed) could be as follows for some of other items on <gloss

                        <p>1. Dept and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> are giving urgent
                            consideration to proposals for arms and aircraft transfers to Morocco.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy is basically sympathetic
                            to Moroccan needs, which we want to meet to extent possible in way that
                            does not appear to be internationalizing Sahara dispute <pb n="214"
                                facs="0241" xml:id="pg_214"/>through highly visible emergency supply
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> equipment, particularly during
                            current Arab and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> diplomatic efforts
                            to reconcile <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> differences over self-determination
                            prior to end of Spanish administration on February 28. We recognize that
                            Morocco under-armed vis-à-vis Algeria and want to help in part to offset
                            the imbalance.</p>
                        <p>2. In this context Dept is prepared to immediately authorize transfer of
                            items most readily available and easily moved and where replacement not
                            major factor, as soon as we meet statutory requirements relating to
                            third-party transfers as contained in section 3 (A) of Foreign Military
                            Sales Act (FMSA), as amended, i.e., advance notification of Congress and
                            receipt of transfer assurances from <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                            >GOM</gloss>. Specifics discussed below. Action on other items
                            complicated by many factors and will require further discussion with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>. Embassy
                            requested communicate decisions to <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            and discuss other aspects with Jordanians in accordance with following
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>3. General points you should emphasize to <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A. Replacements for most items under consideration for transfer to
                            Morocco cannot be furnished quickly because of lengthy production lead
                            times which may range from 20 to 48 months in some cases.</p>
                        <p>B. Replacement costs will exceed original costs to Jordan of any items
                            transferred to Morocco and <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has no
                            rpt no funds to absorb these added costs. We assume this is matter to be
                            worked out between <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. Responsibility for maintenance status of the equipment selected for
                            transfer must necessarily rest with countries involved.</p>
                        <p>D. Any transfers of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> supplied equipment
                            from Iran and Jordan to Morocco, or from Iran via Jordan to Morocco,
                            must be notified to Congress and will therefore be public knowledge. You
                            should be sure <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> fully understands
                            inevitability of Congressional and press attention to and possible
                            criticism of transaction. Transfer procedures are outlined in Ref E.</p>
                        <p>E. <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> should submit diplomatic note or
                            other written message through <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> or
                            MinDef to Embassy formally requesting <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> authority to effect transfers in question.</p>
                        <p>F. If Jordanians raise subject of U.S. airlift, you should say you must
                            refer question to Washington. In this connection, you might inquire
                            whether <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> has explored possibilities
                            of assistance in arranging airlift from Saudis and other friendly Arab
                            states with capability. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: Transport
                            by <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> aircraft would be very costly,

                        <p>A. Recoilless rifles: Dept is prepared to agree to transfer to Morocco
                            from Jordan of 36 106 mm recoilless rifles. We understand <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> is not rpt not asking for
                            replacements. Dept understanding is that <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2"
                                >Jordan</persName> received 106mm recoilless rifles under <gloss

                            after which guns could be transferred to third party. (<gloss

                            transfer can be made as soon as <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>
                            files written request, Dept informs Congress in advance, and <gloss

                            disposition of these items as required by FMSA. Suggested text being
                            furnished Rabat by septel.</p>
                        <p>B. 20 F–5As from Jordanian Air Force: You should inform <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> that first need is to work out
                            practical problems of transfer with <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                            >GOJ</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>. Please convey following points to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>—Deliveries of initial F–5Es as replacements for F–5As, if Morocco agrees
                            to this, cannot rpt not commence before late 1977 because of long
                            production lead times. This is reason <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> seeks earlier delivery via transfers from Jordan.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> should understand this point
                            before proceeding with transfer.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has no funds to absorb cost of
                            replacements to <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName> from
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> order of F–5Es which will
                            greatly exceed value of F–5As. We assume this will be worked out between
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—Ask <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> estimated time needed to put
                            F–5As in condition for ferrying to Morocco. Alternatively, if they are
                            to be disassembled for shipment and reassembled in Morocco, need
                            estimate of when planes could be operable. Latter is complicated
                            operation requiring jigs and substantial team at each end.</p>
                        <p>—Seek <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>’s views on most practicable
                            means of moving these planes, reminding them of need to get overflight
                            and landing/refueling clearances in Greece, Italy, Spain. We are
                            prepared support <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> requests for
                            clearances.</p>
                        <p>C. 16 155 mm howitzers and ammo (both small arms and artillery) from Iran
                            to Morocco via Jordan. Inform <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> that
                            we are prepared to agree to its transferring these items to Morocco once
                            they are received from Iran, but that we should again have to comply
                            with statutory provisions for advance notification of Congress and
                            transfer assurances from recipient.</p>
                        <p>D. 4 or 5 F–5As with munitions from Iran: We have no objection to
                            transfer of these aircraft and munitions from Iran to Jordan but same
                            considerations discussed in Paras 3D and 4B above would apply to their
                            onward transfer to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>E. REDEYE: Although REDEYES were not among items <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> indicated it could provide to Morocco, they appear on

                                facs="0243" xml:id="pg_216"/>and <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> may have them under consideration. If Jordanians raise
                            subject, inform them that we would not approve their transfer to
                            Morocco, consistent with our policy of not rpt not further proliferating
                            this weapon.</p>
                        <p>5. You correctly surmised that matériel would not be available from our
                            assets in Europe (nor from <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military
                            inventories anywhere) and may confirm this if Jordanians raise it
                            again.</p>
                        <p>6. Embassy requested inform Dept ASAP of <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> reaction to points you raise with them and whether

                            under applicable conditions. Dept will not rpt not initiate steps to

                            will receive only two APC’s from CY 76 production and have no existing
                            units which could be made available to Morocco. Only possible short-term
                            source would appear to be <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>
                            which is scheduled to receive 53 APC’s in first quarter CY 76.
                            Department has no objection if <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            wants to approach <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> for some of

                        <p>3. Howitzers and 106 mm recoilless rifles: We have agreed, subject to
                            prior Congressional notification and to fulfillment of other statutory
                            requirements, to transfer of 16 howitzers and 36 recoilless rifles from
                            Iran and Jordan respectively. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> could

                            possible offering for shipment of new 106’s is April 1976.</p>

                            but see no advantage to further acceleration as no trained Moroccan

                            >TOW</gloss>, sufficient Moroccan personnel will not have completed
                            operations and maintenance training prior to scheduled delivery dates,
                            making advance delivery impractical.</p>
                        <p>6. Chaparral missile: Moroccan teams scheduled to complete Chaparral
                            training in mid-CY 76 so delivery prior to that time would not be
                            useful. <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> has already rejected offer
                            of early delivery of rebuilt Chaparrals.</p>
                        <p>7. F–5’s: LOA for sale of F–5E’s and F–5F’s went to Congress February 18
                            and survey team plans to arrive in Morocco shortly to begin preliminary
                            work on basis of unsigned LOA. There are no available F–5A’s in <gloss

                        <p>9. You may inform the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> of foregoing,

                        <p>The following is a review of where we stand on military supplies for
                            Morocco, both the on-going program and urgent requests submitted in
                            connection with the Spanish Saharan dispute.</p>
                        <p>Since the Secretary’s 1973 visit to Morocco, the King has wanted us to
                            move expeditiously on the modernization of two brigades. The major items
                            included tanks, APC’s CHAPARRALS, <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                            >TOW</gloss>’s, VUL-CANS and 155 mm howitzers. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> launched a comprehensive Army review of all Moroccan
                            requests and this resulted in improved lead-times for several major
                            items (notably 26 M48A5 tanks, APC’s and <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss> launchers).</p>
                        <p>On January 8, in the context of the increasingly heated Spanish Saharan
                            problem, King Hassan made a major pitch to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRG_1">Neumann</persName> for the expediting of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms deliveries and particularly for one
                            squadron of the older F–5A/B’s as soon as possible, presumably in
                            addition to the F–5E/F’s which the Moroccans hoped would move quickly.
                            [The LOA has gone to Congress but deliveries cannot be made until late
                            1977.] Shortly thereafter the Moroccans sent special emissaries to
                            Tehran and Amman (following the suggestion made to the Moroccan
                            Ambassador here by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>)
                            urging they immediately provide Morocco with all or any of the
                            following: <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>’s, REDEYES, 109A2
                            Howitzers, 106 mm guns, 7.62 (Nato) rounds, shells for 155 mm guns, 25
                            F–5 aircraft. The Secretary also met with Hassan’s special emissary,
                            Lamrani, who redoubled the pitch for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            arms support.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Response:</hi> The
                            Secretary was sent two action memoranda, prepared by <gloss

                            in close collaboration with <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss>, with
                            options on what might be done in response to requests for further
                            acceleration of direct <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> deliveries and
                            for transfer from Iran and Jordan. Apart from restraints imposed by the
                            need to protect our own inventories, the main foreign policy point was
                            made that we want, on the one hand, to be <pb n="219" facs="0246"
                                xml:id="pg_219"/>supportive of Morocco, but, on the other, to avoid
                            such a high level of aid that it would lead to internationalization and
                            escalation of the dispute. On the basis of those arguments, the
                            Secretary made the following decisions:</p>

                        <p>—Transfer to Morocco from Jordan of 36 106 mm recoilless rifles.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName> would provide as a
                            “gift”)</p>
                        <p>—Transfer to Morocco from Iran of 16 155 mm howitzers and ammunition
                            through <persName corresp="#p_JAA_2">Jordan</persName>. [Iran requested
                            that Jordan be the middleman so that Iran would not act directly in an
                            “Arab” dispute.]</p>
                        <p>—Approval in principle of the transfer of F–5A’s but inquire of <persName

                            involved.</p>
                        <p>—Tell the Iranians we will be sympathetic to replacing the transferred
                            equipment and will study the matter; tell Jordan and Iran we are
                            continuing to urgently consider the remainder of the Moroccan
                            requests.</p>

                        <p>Our posts were advised of the difficulties of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> providing equipment directly but of our willingness to
                            see Iran and Jordan be helpful. In the latter respect, the posts were
                            advised that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had <hi
                                rend="italic">no</hi> funds to absorb the added costs of replacement
                            equipment; Congressional notification and other bureaucratic procedures
                            involving transfers take time and the parties should also understand the
                            transfer approval will become public.</p>
                        <p>The initial reaction by Morocco, Jordan and Iran to our response was
                            positive. Subsequently, problems have arisen in the transfer of the
                            aircraft. [Jordan planned to transfer 25 F–5A’s given it by Iran to meet
                            the Moroccan requirement.] Rifai has insisted that Morocco replace the
                            aging F–5A’s (used, worth $200,000 each) with the new F–5E’s planned for
                            Morocco (worth $3 million each) for which we have sent LOA’s to
                            Congress. However, the Moroccans have balked at this and the Jordanian
                            Air Force Commander is threatening to resign because of the gap which
                            would be created by transfer of the F–5A’s without immediate
                            replacement. Rifai has therefore told us this week not to make any moves
                            to inform the Hill of an impending transfer while he works on the
                            Moroccans. We have told the interested posts that there are no F–5A’s
                            available in our inventory.</p>

                        <p>A brief chronology of the Moroccan arms requests dialogue is at Tab III.
                            Further, the Secretary has decided to postpone the planned February
                            27–March 1 visit of the first nuclear powered warship to stop in Morocco
                            (a move only recently approved by the King) because of the sensitivities
                            of the Spanish Sahara situation. The telegram at Tab IV sums up the
                            political sensitivities that the Secretary has taken into consideration
                            in the various arms decisions.</p>

                        <p>If the Jordanian F–5 deal falls through we see little chance for
                            stepped-up deliveries of fighter aircraft to Morocco without diversion
                            of equipment from <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> stocks. In this
                            regard, the Air Force has 21 recovered F–5E’s, some of which conceivably
                            could be loaned or given (Jordan has no funds) to Jordan immediately for
                            twice the number of F–5A’s to be delivered to Morocco. We doubt this
                            would be acceptable to Defense and it has <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            been discussed with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Other help is more feasible. There are currently enroute to Iran 12 155
                            SP howitzers which could be diverted to Morocco and arrive within a
                            week. We have suggested this to the Iranians, but have received no
                            response. We could renew this initiative with increased urgency. In
                            addition, we understand that 28 M48A5 tanks which the Moroccans have
                            purchased will be ready for shipment next week. It may be as much as 60
                            days, however, before they can be shipped in American bottoms, as <pb
                                n="221" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_221"/>the law requires. Waiving this
                            requirement could reduce the time necessary to have these tanks in
                            Moroccan hands to a few weeks.</p>

                            complained about not being keep informed. It may be that our military
                            responsible for Iran and Jordan (like the Jordanian Air Force), are not
                            keen on seeing equipment transferred to Morocco at the expense of the
                            military establishments they are assisting. Or it may simply be that
                            military commands are naturally dubious when civilians redistribute
                            equipment and appear not to understand the complications involved (which
                            in this deal have been many). However, State has been pretty good (with

                            Embassies the sorts of logistics and shipping problems they will face.

                            Morocco to the United States—IV. Ref: Rabat 1154, Rabat 1346.</p>
                        <p>1. The Dept will be relieved to learn that this is the last in the series
                            of personal reflections on U.S. interests in Morocco and the region
                            which I am transmitting immediately prior to my departure from post.</p>
                        <p>2. In previous messages submitted over a year ago (e.g. my telegram 4467
                            of January 31, 1975), I urged that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> undertake a long-range assessment of Morocco’s
                            strategic importance to the United States. Unfortunately the answer was
                            a non-answer and wise counsellors in the Department of State suggested
                            to me that I accept, as a given fact, that under then obtaining
                            conditions, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was unable to plan
                            in long-range terms.</p>
                        <p>3. As a single individual, on the eve of his departure from this post, I
                            cannot hope to substitute for a major planning organization. I can only
                            raise a few questions which the Department of State and Defense might
                            occasionally consider.</p>
                        <p>4. To begin, my assumptions are: (A) That with the increasingly rapid
                            growth of democratic rights in Spain, our bases there will become
                            increasingly controversial, no matter what agreements we may have. (B)
                            That with the strengthening of the Communist Party in Italy, with the
                            continued inability of the Socialist and Social Democratic mini-parties
                            to make a dent in the CP, and with the possibility, sooner or later, of
                            a deal between at least some elements of the Christian Democrats and the
                            Communists, the Communists may eventually achieve their objective of
                            sharing governmental power, or at least exercising real influence
                            thereon. The least that can be said is that such an arrangement is
                            capable of placing our bases in Italy in jeopardy. (C) That the
                            aftereffects of the 1974 Cyprus crisis will be long-lasting, and that it
                            will be many years, if ever, before the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> can reestablish security relations with Greece and
                            Turkey that are even approximately as close as what we had before. (D)
                            That almost daily we see new evidence of growing Soviet naval strength
                            in the Mediterranean . . . it does not, therefore, re<pb n="223"
                                facs="0250" xml:id="pg_223"/>quire exercise of much imagination to
                            envisage a scenario in which the position of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the
                            Mediterranean may become untenable—and all that without a war.</p>
                        <p>5. Under these circumstances I find it astonishing, to say the least,
                            that our government has not by now given some reasonably methodical and
                            consistent thought to the options which Morocco presents. To be sure,
                            Morocco does so out of self-interest, this is usual. Offers made solely
                            out of pretended friendship are deeply suspect. Agreements to be truly
                            valid have to serve the purposes of all parties.</p>
                        <p>6. The King has said that if the U.S. helps Morocco more on the Sahara,
                            any kind of open or other military cooperation agreement is possible and
                            would be supported by all Moroccans. I do not suggest that such an
                            agreement is necessarily in the U.S. national interest, or that it could
                            pass Congressional muster. But until we calculate what we might wish
                            from Morocco we cannot really know what kind of a response best serves
                            our interests.</p>
                        <p>7. A variety of facilities or rights are and remain within our grasp.
                            What might we want? Nuclear submarine pens? Other naval installations?
                            Port facilities? Beaches for landing exercises, simulated or real?
                            Bombing ranges? Rights to activate former <gloss target="#t_SAC_1"
                                >SAC</gloss> bases on short notice?</p>
                        <p>8. Once again let me underline that I am not repeat not proposing that we
                            do any of these things. But until there is a cool, long-range assessment
                            of the possible value of the above, we cannot really judge intelligently
                            whether political considerations outweigh them. They probably would but
                            I should like to see this question studied seriously and not shoved
                            under the rug on the basis of little or nothing more than a political
                            “quesstimate.”</p>
                        <p>9. The above I have said, more or less, before. But now there are new
                            factors:</p>
                        <p>A. The Soviet-Cuban involvement in Angola has made the west coast of
                            Africa vulnerable. How important, now, has a U.S. anchor in
                            Morocco-Mauritania-Senegal become?</p>
                        <p>B. The world situation imperatively demands a solution of the Middle East
                            problem. This will take years, but so does planning and implementation.
                            Therefore the possibility of future U.S. military arrangements with
                            Morocco ought to be viewed in part in a post-Middle East-problem
                            light.</p>
                        <p>C. The Angola and Saharan problems have revealed fragility within the
                            African bloc. Oil price differences have revealed weaknesses in <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>. And a prolongation of the Sahara
                            and other issues could weaken Arab solidarity toward the Arab-Israel
                            conflict. In that case the moderate Government of Morocco could be a
                            prime candidate for jumping off the bandwagon. More reason for keeping
                            our relations with Morocco warm.</p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_224"/>
                        <p>10. In sum, in Morocco we have considerable potential political and
                            military assets. Political and/or military-technical considerations may
                            very well suggest that these not be pursued at this time. But in view of
                            the fragility of our positions elsewhere in Africa and in the
                            Mediterranean region, that picture could change. It follows that it
                            makes sense for us, not only to analyze what Moroccan strategic assets
                            are worth to us, but to keep the Moroccan connection warm and friendly.
                            For even if we continue to refrain from exploiting our strategic
                            opportunities here at this time, we should keep in mind that future
                            circumstances may force us to recalculate our priorities.</p>
                        <p>11. For the present, keeping our Moroccan connection warm and friendly is
                            preeminently a function of our stance on the Sahara issue. We have
                            generally favored the Moroccan position, under the guise of
                            neutrality—and that is good. As concerns our military supply program, we
                            have not been as forthcoming as we might have been but in view of our
                            own matériel shortages we have, on the whole, not done badly by Morocco.
                            Where we have been most remiss, however, has been in the way we have
                            handled not only certain aspects of our arms program, but also other
                            elements of our relations. All too often we have delayed or postponed
                            decisions on actions of great importance to Morocco for reasons which
                            sometimes could not be understood and on other occasions could be
                            understood all too well. The six month delay in presenting the letter of
                            offer for the F–5E squadron falls in the former category, as does the
                            incredible 13-month delay in deciding on a Title I PL–480 program for
                            Morocco; the postponement of the recently scheduled <gloss
                                target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visit falls in the latter

                        <p>12. Perhaps I can distill the essence of the frustration I have felt in
                            the last two and a half years, and which I have tried to spell out in
                            this series of four telegrams, into one last Parthian shot: Gentlemen,
                            we need to know what we want and what we are doing, if we are to deal
                            successfully with this friendly but complex country. And if we are
                            unable to decide what we want, let us at least try to act in a way that
                            gives the Moroccans the impression, however misleading, that we know
                            what we are doing.</p>

                        <p>a. The Department of the Navy plans to close its two remaining
                            installations in Morocco. Aware of Navy plans, our Ambassador to Morocco
                            has asked <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> to identify any future
                            requirements for military facilities in Morocco so he may present a
                            complete picture to King Hassan when he reveals the Navy closures.
                            Consequently, the Joint Chiefs of Staff surveyed Service requirements in
                            response to <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss> tasking and included
                            their recommendations in the paper at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>b. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> provided his
                            views on the Joint Staff recommendations prior to his departure on
                            holiday and they are indicated where applicable. We sent you a paper on
                            this topic last week (Tab D).</p>

                            to cease its housekeeping functions at Kenitra (annual Navy cost $12.5
                            million), a Moroccan Air Base. The Navy responsibility at Kenitra has
                            been a quid for keeping the communications stations in Morocco. When
                            Navy announced its plans some months ago, Ambassador <persName

                            communications stations (annual cost to Navy for school operations:
                            $58,000 O&amp;M, $198,000 for 18 <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            military personnel (Tab B)). Navy also agreed to give one year’s notice
                            to local national employees. We understand the Ambassador has seen and
                            posed no objection to the Navy plan which is part of the <gloss

                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi> Recently King Hassan has been most

                            not change without a radical shift in the political situation. The same
                            tacit agreement applies to overflight and landing rights. Nevertheless,
                            it may be expedient to seek agreement in principle for increased access
                            now while the climate is conducive. This might also reassure the King
                            that our interest in Morocco has not waned.</p>

                            from 26, prior to 1960, to nine today. The fleet requires 5–7 training
                            sites for 5–10 days during each six month deployment cycle. Most of the
                            remaining beaches have terrain limitations or host country restrictions.
                            We recognize, however, that if King Hassan were to allow such use of
                            Moroccan beaches he could be the target of heavy criticism by
                            neighboring and third world countries. There is also the likelihood that
                            the Soviet Union might use our action as a lever to gain similar rights

                            prefers that the site be located on one of the two Navy facilities that
                            are scheduled for closure. The Air Force, believing that <pb n="227"

                            improvement), is reluctant to accept either of the Navy facilities.
                                <gloss target="#t_GEODSS_1">GEODSS</gloss> would employ about 5

                        <p>Air Force presently has an air-to-ground range at Bardenas Reales and a
                            very limited air-to-air range at Zaragoza, Spain which would continue to
                            operate even with the Moroccan facility with little effect upon the
                            overall <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Spanish connection. The
                            existing Spanish fighter ranges are inadequate for air-to-air training
                            but are suitable for air-ground training. The Moroccan base would
                            resemble Wheelus <gloss target="#t_AFB_1">AFB</gloss> in Libya prior to
                            its closing in 1970. It would employ approximately 350 <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military, 150 <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> civilians, and 400–500 local nationals. We view the
                            political risks for both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and
                            Morocco as significant, although King Hassan did offer such facilities
                            in private conversations with you, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1"
                                >Sisco</persName>, Admiral Turner, and CDR SIXTHFLT. We believe the
                            other Arab countries and the non-aligned nations would be highly
                            critical. We also believe that the Soviets might use the Moroccan action
                            as a persuasive argument to seek bases in Algeria or Libya. Other
                            problems concern funding and base rights: King Hassan could be expected
                            to drive a hard bargain in terms of guarantees, financial as well as
                            political; and whatever the amount of funds sought, Congress would
                            probably require a firm basing agreement, something King Hassan has
                            eschewed in the past.</p>
                        <p>Despite the uncertainties and political risks involved for both sides,
                            the air training center would be a substantial asset to both the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Moroccan defense postures. For the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, a training center in Morocco
                            would provide the Air Force with a desperately needed place in which to
                            conduct air combat training. The need is especially acute for the F–15s
                            which have a primary mission of air superiority. On the Moroccan side, a
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operation would show a real

                            installations and access to Morocco (Attachment 2). In ascending order
                            of visibility and importance, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s
                            desiderata are: Increased access to Moroccan port and air facilities,
                            establishment of a <gloss target="#t_GEODSS_1">GEODSS</gloss> station, a
                            Military Airlift Command staging site for emergency humanitarian
                            missions in Africa, the use of Moroccan beaches for amphibious landing
                            practice, a Strategic Air Command forward operating facility, and an
                            aerial tactics training center and bombing range.</p>
                        <p>Some elements in the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> package,
                            including the most time-sensitive, could be presented to King Hassan at
                            once; others which require extensive study and interagency consultation
                            could be presented later if it were decided to do so, but such
                            far-reaching policy decisions clearly should be deferred for the next
                            Administration and would require advance congressional consultation. The
                            Air Force weapons training center and <gloss target="#t_SAC_1"
                                >SAC</gloss> forward operating facility, for example, would place
                            several hundred uniformed personnel in Morocco, would require a base
                            agreement and might involve a substantial U.S. military assistance
                            program as a quid pro quo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AR_1"
                                >Anderson</persName> has expressed strong reservations, with which I
                            concur, about the advisability of these two programs and about
                            amphibious landing exercises, but I believe that we could move forward
                            with the other proposals.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I am seeking your approval to propose to Defense that we
                            divide its package into two categories, allowing us to decide on
                            time-sensitive and less controversial elements now while we go back to
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> with our reservations on the
                            other elements.</p>
                        <p>Further, I am asking your approval for an approach to King Hassan on the
                            first category of the Defense package, provided Defense accepts our

                            recommends that the closure be handled in such a way as to avoid giving

                            lessened American interest in their country and to minimize the economic

                            requirements in Morocco. When it approved the Navy plan, <gloss

                            installation is vital to our plan for a five-site worldwide system which
                            would give us for the first time a total monitoring capacity for
                            satellites out as far as 22,500 nautical miles. It would also spin off
                            some geophysical data for the host country.</p>
                        <p>Carrying out the projects proposed by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> would serve a number of military purposes. According to
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>: our Marines on duty in the
                            Mediterranean have insufficient use of beaches to maintain their
                            amphibious landing proficiency; our already inadequate aerial training
                            facilities in Europe will be wholly unable to meet the training
                            requirements for the F–15 and other new generation aircraft; a <gloss
                                target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> site would increase our B–52 and
                            KC–135 capacity in the Middle East and Southeastern Europe.
                            Additionally, the obvious supportive aspects of such an augmented U.S.
                            military presence may be attractive to Moroccan King Hassan II, who
                            feels the need for external support in face of possible conflict with
                            Algeria and may believe that the implied support is worth the cost to
                            his non-aligned image in the Third World. Actually, hosting the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAC_1">MAC</gloss> humanitarian airlift site may redound
                            to Morocco’s credit, especially if relief efforts could be mounted as
                            joint U.S.-Moroccan operations. Some of the expected international
                            criticism could perhaps be mitigated by co-locating, where possible,
                            U.S. facilities on existing Moroccan bases or by appearing to
                            subordinate the U.S. activity to a Moroccan role as we now do at
                            Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>The establishment in Morocco of facilities of this importance would
                            solidify our relationship with the Moroccan military, likely to be the
                            most significant element in post-Hassan Morocco.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, implacement of these proposed facilities, particularly
                            the air base and the <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> site, in
                            Morocco would probably subject both governments to a storm of
                            international criticism which would reduce Moroccan credibility, and
                            usefulness to us, in the Third World. Such criticism at this time could
                            also be harmful to Morocco’s <pb n="232" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_232"
                            />hopes for Third World support for its claims of sovereignty in Western
                            Sahara. For these reasons, a major expansion of our military role in
                            Morocco will not come free of cost and if Hassan agreed to one or more
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> proposals, his price in
                            terms of monetary assistance, arms sales and support for Morocco’s
                            Sahara policy might be greater than we are willing to pay. Moreover, it
                            was King Hassan who claimed credit for the removal of foreign bases from
                            Morocco in 1963 and even though he has offered the U.S. similar
                            privileges at various times, the domestic impact of a policy reversal on
                            the issue of foreign bases might weaken his internal position.</p>
                        <p>We need also to consider the probably adverse reaction of Congress to
                            proposals to establish a new U.S. base presence overseas. The
                            Congressional role will be particularly acute if, as seems likely, the
                            Air Force insists on a formal base and status of forces agreement for
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> and tactical training
                            sites.</p>
                        <p>There is, in addition, the possibility that expanded and obviously
                            combat-related U.S. military training facilities in Morocco might
                            provoke Algeria or Libya to provide similar facilities to the Soviets.
                            Embassy Algiers reports that the Algerian leaders are deeply concerned
                            by our role as a major arms supplier to Morocco and have warned
                            repeatedly that this would adversely affect our long-term economic and
                            political interests in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>In considering the potentially most controversial elements of the
                            package, (the <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> facility and
                            airbase/bombing range) we might explore with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> the possibility of seeking use of Moroccan territory
                            (preferably an existing <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> base such
                            as Ben Guerir) for bombing/gunnery practice by <gloss target="#t_USAF_1"
                                >USAF</gloss> personnel on periodic temporary duty in Morocco. If we
                            offered the Moroccans air force training through joint exercises, and
                            were prepared to field a small permanent support team of <gloss

                            personnel whose services would be available to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>, Hassan might be receptive. Embassy
                            Rabat suggests this as a workable alternative to a full-fledged airbase
                            with a large American presence and accompanying support facilities
                            (schools, PX’s, commissaries, etc.) and, if it meets <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s functional needs, it might be
                            included in a later proposal to Hassan. We must assume, however, that
                            whatever its form, such a facility could not be used by us for
                            operations related to the Middle East, especially a new Arab-Israel
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>Although the proposed amphibious landing exercises could be of brief
                            duration and set up as joint exercises in isolated areas, Embassy Rabat
                            believes very strongly that we should not seek <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> permission for actual landings which are potentially
                            too controversial within and outside of Morocco. Rather, the Embassy
                            recommends that we propose joint <hi rend="italic">simulated</hi>
                            landing exercises offshore. King Hassan, in a conversa<pb n="233"
                                facs="0260" xml:id="pg_233"/>tion with Admiral Turner last December,
                            displayed an interest in this possibility, and, if we decide to pursue
                            the matter of amphibious exercises, we might present it in the context
                            of the first category <hi rend="italic">if we confine ourselves
                                initially to simulated landings</hi>, preferably in isolated areas

                            feasibility that must be considered by the next Administration if they
                            are to be further entertained at all. It seems advisable to make
                            decisions on those measures that must be set in train before January 20
                            and leave the more controversial items for the next Administration.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SPANISH SAHARA: PAWN OF NORTHWEST AFRICA [*This memorandum
                            was prepared under the auspices of the National Intelligence Officer for
                            the Middle East. It was principally drafted by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                        <p>1. Spain is embroiled in controversy with three African countries over
                            the future of Spanish Sahara. Unless Madrid can devise a solution to the
                            problem that is acceptable to all four interested parties—Spain,
                            Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania—its withdrawal from the territory may
                            lead to further instability, including the possibility of armed
                            conflict. Although the United States has no major interests in Spanish
                            Sahara, its primary concern is to prevent the issue from upsetting the
                            peace of the region.</p>
                        <p>2. Spanish Sahara, located along the Atlantic coast of northwest Africa,
                            is juridically a Spanish province and is also claimed by Morocco and
                            Mauritania. Algeria has also gone on record as “an interested party” in
                            the future disposition of the area. The discovery of natural resources,
                            primarily phosphates, has made the territory even more valuable to Spain
                            and desirable to its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>3. As one of the last vestiges of European colonialism in Africa, Spanish
                            Sahara has been the focus of much anti-colonial rhetoric and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has passed a number of resolutions
                            calling for self-determination for the area. Portugal’s recent decision
                            to grant independence to its African territories and renewed Moroccan
                            claims have increased pressure on Spain to relinquish the desert
                            province. Madrid’s subsequent decision to hold a referendum in Spanish
                            Sahara next year will generate attempts by the four interested parties
                            to influence the outcome of the vote.</p>

                        <p>4. Spain’s contacts with the area date from 1476 when it established a
                            fort there, but Madrid showed little interest in the territory until the
                            mid-19th century. At the Congress of Berlin in 1885, Spain unilaterally
                            proclaimed a protectorate over the coastal zone from Cabo Bojador to
                            Cabo Blanco, to be administered from the Canary Islands. The present day
                            borders of Spanish Sahara were derived from a series of Franco-Spanish
                            conventions between 1900 and 1912 which did not consider questions of
                            historical or ethnic unity.</p>
                        <p>5. In 1958, Madrid declared the territory an overseas province of Spain,
                            following border incursions by armed tribesmen from Morocco. Three years
                            later the province was given limited representation in the Spanish
                            parliament. Political power in the province is concentrated in the hands
                            of the Spanish governor general; he is directly responsible to an
                            official in the office of the Prime Minister. In addition to his
                            civilian function, he is also the commander in chief of all provincial
                            military forces, including the police.</p>
                        <p>6. The Spanish have invested heavily in the Sahara over the last decade,
                            both in the phosphate enterprise and in social infrastructure. They have
                            upgraded housing, schooling, and other facilities, with attendant
                            publicity. To protect this investment, blunt international criticism,
                            and postpone a referendum on self-determination, the Spanish in 1967
                            created a general assembly (Yemaa), composed of 45 tribal chiefs and 40
                            elected representatives, to act as an advisory body on the prov<pb
                                n="237" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_237"/>ince’s economic and social
                            development. Thus far the assembly has toed the Spanish line, rejecting
                            outside interference, calling for gradual steps toward
                            self-determination, and reaffirming loyalty to Spain.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Moroccan Irredentism</p>
                        <p>7. Upon independence in 1956, Morocco laid claim to all of Spain’s
                            holdings in northwestern Africa. In a joint declaration and protocol
                            signed in April 1956, Madrid gave up its protectorate zone in the north
                            of Morocco. Spain relinquished the southern protectorate zone of Tarfaya
                            in 1958 and the enclave of Ifni in 1969. Thus, Spain’s present holdings
                            include Spanish Sahara and five small <hi rend="italic"
                            >presidios</hi>—the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, on the Mediterranean
                            coast of Morocco, and three small offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>8. Morocco bases its claim to the Spanish Sahara on pre-colonial history,
                            when Moroccan rulers intermittently exercised varying degrees of control
                            over much of the western Sahara. From the 10th thru the 17th centuries,
                            Moroccans looked southward, penetrating Spanish Sahara, Mauritania,
                            southwestern Algeria, and for a short time Mali. At one time or another
                            the nomadic peoples in the area accepted the religious supremacy of the
                            Sultan. The successive waves of Moroccan penetration, however,
                            alternated with periods when Morocco’s interest turned northward to
                            Spain. During these times politico-religious chieftains from present day
                            Mauritania extended their control into Morocco, which had several
                            dynasties of Mauritanian origin.</p>
                        <p>9. Morocco has argued that the territory it recovered from the European
                            powers in 1956 represents only part of the Sultan’s historical holdings.
                            Indeed, it was not until 1970 that Rabat recognized the Islamic Republic
                            of Mauritania, ten years after it became independent. Morocco’s claim to
                            part of Algeria was the cause of a brief border war in 1963. Both
                            parties signed an agreement in 1972 demarcating their common boundary,
                            but Rabat has not yet ratified it.</p>
                        <p>10. Rabat also has economic interests at stake in Spanish Sahara. Morocco
                            currently is the third-largest producer and the largest exporter of
                            phosphate rock in the world. Until 1973 when the world phosphate market
                            began improving, Morocco viewed Spanish Saharan phosphates as a threat
                            to its own important phosphate industry if Spain retained control.
                            Although these fears no longer seem warranted, Rabat would stand to gain
                            a larger source of foreign exchange and government profits if it could
                            acquire control of the area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Mauritania’s Claim</p>
                        <p>11. Like Morocco, the area of present day Mauritania has exercised
                            varying degrees of influence in the Sahara, especially at times when
                            North African Arabs focused their attention on Spain. Spanish Sahara has
                            no “natural frontiers” and shares its southern and virtually all of <pb
                                n="238" facs="0265" xml:id="pg_238"/>its long eastern border with
                            Mauritania. Probably as many Saharan nomads migrate to Mauritania as to
                            Morocco. As a result, many of the tribes of the territory probably have
                            more in common with the Moors who dominate the government in Nouakchott
                            than with the Arabs and Arabized Berbers who rule in Rabat or Algiers.
                            Moreover, the Hassaniya dialect spoken in much of the area is nearly
                            identical to that spoken in Mauritania and quite different from the
                            Maghrebi Arabic spoken in Morocco. Thus history can be used to support
                            Mauritanian as well as Moroccan claims.</p>

                        <p>12. Spanish Sahara is an almost completely arid wasteland. Fishing and
                            livestock raising constitute the basis of the native economy. The only
                            crop that can be grown successfully is barley, and that only
                            occasionally in low-lying areas after rain. The discovery of a large
                            underground lake in the Villa Cisneros area has led to some successful
                            experimental farming.</p>
                        <p>13. The Sahara is important to Spain primarily because of large deposits
                            of high-grade phosphate rock discovered in 1963 in Bu Craa, some 60
                            miles from the coast near Morocco. Reserves, estimated at 1.4 to 1.7
                            billion tons of minerals, are sufficient to put Spanish Sahara among the
                            world’s leading producers and exporters for many years.</p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_239"/>
                        <p>14. A Spanish state mining company, FosBuCraa, is developing the deposits
                            and is expected to ship as much as two million tons in 1974. By 1978
                            production may reach 6 million tons annually, an output worth around
                            $389 million at current prices. FosBuCraa has invested at least $200
                            million to provide facilities for mining, processing, and
                            transportation. Total investment in the mining complex, including funds
                            from several non-Spanish sources, may run as high as $480 million.</p>
                        <p>15. The facilities and methods for handling the phosphate ore are among
                            the most modern in the world. The ore is extracted by open-pit mining,
                            reduced to concentrates at the Bu Craa complex, and then transported on
                            a completely automated belt conveyor system to ore-loading facilities in
                            El Aaiun. Built by the Krupp Machinery and Steel Construction Company of
                            West Germany at a cost of about $50 million, the innovative system
                            includes 10 six-mile-long conveyors.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <graphic url="autoconveyorbelt.jpg"/>

                        </figure>
                        <p>16. Expanding Spanish Saharan phosphate production should find ready
                            buyers abroad. The increasing demand for fertilizers has strengthened
                            the world phosphate market. With assured markets in Spain and low
                            operating and transport costs, Saharan phosphates are in a strong
                            competitive position.</p>
                        <p>17. Other mineral assets could further increase the value of the
                            territory. Surveys show an estimated 20 to 70 million tons of iron ore
                            are <pb n="240" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_240"/>located in the south at
                            Agracha, but the economic feasibility of exploiting these deposits,
                            which contain undesirable amounts of titanium, has yet to be determined.
                            In the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s the Spanish believed that the
                            territory held sizeable petroleum deposits. Concessions for onshore
                            exploration awarded to several foreign companies proved disappointing
                            and were abandoned in 1969. Since then off-shore concessions have been
                            let to several firms, including <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            companies, and the search continues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Peoples of Spanish Sahara</p>
                        <p>18. Except for Europeans and some sedentary or seminomadic townsmen, most
                            people within the Sahara’s borders are pastoral nomads. There is little
                            if any sense of national identification with the political entity known
                            as Spanish Sahara. Indeed, for most of these illiterate nomads, the
                            concept of loyalty does not extend beyond the tribe or clan to which
                            they belong. More often than not, the nomad views the central government
                            as a remote tax collector that has little relevance to or impact on his
                            traditional way of life.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>19. Spanish Sahara has an estimated population of 60,000 of which 43,000
                            are indigenous Africans and about 17,000 are Spaniards. Given their
                            nomadic lifestyle, it is misleading to regard statistics for the
                            Africans as more than approximations. The migration of tribes and clans
                            into and out of Spanish Sahara—determined by rainfall and grazing
                            conditions—can halve or double these figures.</p>
                        <p>20. The peoples of Spanish Sahara are of Arab, Berber, and black African
                            ancestry. Most of the people are referred to as Moors, who both <pb

                            reflect a historical mixture of Arab invaders and Berber nomads. The
                            latter were probably the original inhabitants of the area. Black peoples
                            from the south have also contributed to the present population.</p>
                        <p>21. Saharans can be divided into various classifications based on
                            different criteria such as social or hierarchical ranks, family or
                            ethnographic relationships, and political associations. The most
                            definitive and probably relevant classification in anticipating the
                            future political development of Spanish Sahara is one based primarily on
                            ethnic origins. Using this yardstick, three groups of nomads are
                            significant for the future of Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>22. The largest group is the Tekna, a relatively peaceful herding people
                            who live in southern Morocco and northern Spanish Sahara. Many Tekna in
                            the Sahara speak a Berber dialect and migrate to Morocco for at least
                            part of the year. Moroccan authorities no doubt depend heavily on Tekna
                            nomads for information on conditions inside the Spanish territory. Since
                            1958, a number of Tekna who formerly lived south of the boundary have
                            remained in Morocco, probably fearing Spanish reprisal for some
                            assistance they gave to insurgents from Morocco.</p>
                        <p>23. The Reguibat group is probably the most powerful of the Saharan
                            peoples in Spanish Sahara. Called the “Blue People” because the indigo
                            dye used on their clothing rubs off on their skin, they range with their
                            camels across wide expanses of southern Morocco, Algeria, Spanish
                            Sahara, and Mauritania. They are known for their ferocity, pride, and
                            ability with firearms and have dominated the eastern part of the Spanish
                            province for a considerable period of time.</p>
                        <p>24. The allegiance of the Reguibat, who are no strangers to gun running
                            and desert intrigue, has been greatly sought after by competing
                            political interests in the area. To date, however, they seem to have
                            successfully resisted these attempts. As far back as the turn of the
                            century, German and Spanish agents helped Morocco to arm the Reguibat
                            against French colonial expansion. The Reguibat were behind several
                            incidents that preceded the brief Moroccan-Algerian border conflict in
                            1963. They also were prominently involved in anti-Spanish demonstrations
                            in El Aaiun in 1970, in which several persons were killed and many more
                            wounded.</p>
                        <p>25. A third group, the Ulad Delim, inhabits the southwestern portion of
                            Spanish Sahara. Although formerly a much stronger political force, the
                            Ulad Delim remain important in the province. They are more Arabized but
                            less numerous than their chief rivals, the Reguibat. Large numbers of
                            Ulad Delim and closely associated peoples live across the border in
                            Mauritania.</p>

                        <p>26. In the face of Morocco’s irredentist claims and anti-colonialist
                            sentiment in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, Spain has counted
                            more on diplomacy than military strength to retain the Sahara. Madrid
                            has played on the mutual suspicions of the three African states that
                            have rival interests in the area, while maintaining generally good
                            bilateral relations with each one. In the early 1960s, taking advantage
                            of Moroccan claims to Mauritania and western Algeria, Spain encouraged
                            Mauritania to stake its own claim to Spanish Sahara and Algeria to
                            assert its right, as a neighboring state, to have a voice in the
                            disposition of the territory. There are Spanish embassies in each
                            capital, and modest assistance programs have been undertaken in each
                            country.</p>
                        <p>27. Madrid’s control of Spanish Sahara has been the subject of a number
                            of resolutions in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly. After the first such resolution in 1965 calling for
                            decolonization of the territory, Spain announced the following year that
                            it agreed in principle to self-determination for the people of Spanish
                            Sahara. Until 1969 Spain regarded these resolutions as innocuous, and in
                            fact voted for them. Madrid began to abstain, however, when criticism of
                            Spanish delaying tactics increased, and resolutions began to refer to
                            the “so-called” Spanish Sahara. Spain nonetheless wants to appear
                            forthcoming because it seeks support for its position on Gibraltar in
                            the same Committee of 24 that considers the Sahara question. Moreover,
                            the arguments that Spain advances to support its claim to Gibraltar
                            could easily be used against continued Spanish control of its Saharan
                            province.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <graphic url="SpanishSaharaMap.jpg"/>
                        </figure>
                        <p>28. Last September General Franco announced that Spanish Sahara would be
                            permitted self-government as a necessary preparation for
                            self-determination, but he gave no timetable. In early July 1974,
                            however, Madrid told the ambassadors of Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania
                            that it was preparing to implement a new policy of increased autonomy
                            for its overseas province. Subsequently, on August 20, Madrid notified
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General that a
                            referendum to decide the political future of Spanish Sahara will be held
                            in the first half of 1975 under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            supervision. Madrid declared that its decision was consistent with
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions calling for
                            self-determination for the peoples of the territory.</p>
                        <p>29. Although there is probably some sentiment, particularly on the part
                            of older military officers, to hang on in the Sahara, Madrid appears
                            determined to withdraw. Spain clearly wants to:</p>
                        <p>—head off criticism in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> this
                            fall;</p>
                        <p>—avoid replacing Portugal as the focus of anti-colonial rhetoric; and</p>
                        <pb n="243" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_243"/>
                        <p>—maintain its assiduously cultivated good relations with the Arab
                            states.</p>
                        <p>30. At the same time, however, the Spanish will be working to protect
                            their economic and security interests in the area. Spain will at least
                            want to recoup its $200 million investment in the Bu Craa phosphate
                            mine. Madrid may even seek to retain an interest in the increasingly
                            profitable operation (see section on economic importance). Madrid may
                            also try to extract from Morocco concessions relating to fishing rights
                            in Moroccan waters or even compensation for expropriated Spanish
                            lands.</p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_244"/>
                        <figure>
                            <graphic url="SpanishSaharaMap2.jpg"/>
                        </figure>
                        <p>31. Madrid views the Sahara as important to the security of the
                            approaches to the Canary Islands, only 60 miles offshore, and has
                            expressed concern over the possibility that an unfriendly government
                            might establish itself in the province. Spain might insist on the
                            retention of base rights in the northern Sahara. Although Morocco has
                            not threatened the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, which the
                            Spanish consider an integral part of Spain, Madrid will probably seek to
                            ensure that any concessions made to Morocco in the Sahara are
                            accompanied by Moroccan assurances concerning the enclaves.</p>
                        <p>32. Spain desires to maintain its good relations and expanding commercial
                            ties with Algeria, one of the interested parties, and will <pb n="245"
                                facs="0272" xml:id="pg_245"/>seek to ensure that any agreement with
                            Morocco is acceptable to Algiers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi></p>
                        <p>33. Morocco has been the most active claimant to Spanish Sahara and
                            periodically has sought to intensify pressure on Madrid to honor Rabat’s
                            irredentism.</p>
                        <p>34. Hassan is convinced that Spain will not wish to remain for long as
                            the only significant colonial power in Africa.</p>
                        <p>35. When Hassan learned in early July that Madrid was about to grant
                            increased autonomy to its overseas province, he reacted sharply. He
                            immediately sent a letter to General Franco warning that such a move
                            would lead to a deterioration in relations. The King followed up with a
                            speech on July 8 in which he emphasized that he could not permit the
                            establishment of a puppet state in the Sahara, and implied that if
                            discussions failed, other means would be pursued.</p>
                        <p>36. Morocco subsequently initiated a major diplomatic campaign to
                            pressure Spain to abandon its plans for greater autonomy for its Saharan
                            province. In late July and early August, Moroccan emissaries visited
                            various Arab and African capitals as well as Asian and East European
                            countries to seek international support for Rabat’s position. Although
                            the Arab and African states will back a demand that Spain leave, they
                            are not inclined to support Morocco’s territorial ambitions, especially
                            in view of Mauritania’s rival claim to the area and Algeria’s insistence
                            on a role as an interested party.</p>
                        <p>37. Eastern Arab countries, always reluctant to take sides in an
                            inter-Arab quarrel, want to avoid any dispute that could weaken the
                            appearance of unity on the far more important question of a Middle East
                            peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>38. Morocco has also engaged in saber-rattling to gain advantage in its
                            dispute with Spain. Since late July, Rabat has placed its armed forces
                            on temporary alert, cancelled all leaves, and mobilized some reservists.
                            Approximately one quarter of Morocco’s ground forces have been deployed
                            to southern Morocco. Additional troops have been sent near the Spanish
                            enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in the north. Although these enclaves have
                            not been an issue in the current controversy, King Hassan apparently
                            wants to remind Madrid that the two cities are vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>39. King Hassan hopes that his campaign to reclaim Spanish Sahara will
                            strengthen his domestic position and distract attention from his
                            country’s political and economic problems. Given the strong irredentist
                            sentiment shared by many Moroccans, the King might be willing to use
                            limited force to back up his claim. As it has in the past, Morocco might
                            again send armed tribesmen across the border to pro<pb n="246"
                                facs="0273" xml:id="pg_246"/>voke clashes and attract international
                            attention in order to increase pressure on Spain for a settlement
                            favorable to Morocco. Conversely, a failure to achieve annexation of at
                            least part of the territory might create severe domestic pressures on
                            Hassan. He may have pushed the issue too far to retreat gracefully.</p>
                        <p>40. So far, however, Morocco has been circumspect in using military
                            pressure tactics. King Hassan wants to create a sense of urgency, but he
                            does not want to close the door to continuing dialogue with Madrid. The
                            King received a letter from General Franco in late July urging bilateral
                            talks, and the Moroccan prime minister and foreign minister visited
                            Madrid on August 12–14 to begin negotiations. Although there was no
                            significant movement by either side, the positive tone of the joint
                            communique and initial Moroccan press reactions set the stage for
                            further bilateral meetings.</p>
                        <p>41. Madrid’s subsequent decision to hold a referendum in the territory in
                            1975 caused King Hassan to attach tough conditions to Morocco’s
                            agreement to a referendum. He insisted that any vote must occur under
                            international control after Spanish troops and administration had been
                            withdrawn. He further indicated that he would oppose holding the
                            referendum if the principle of independence for Sahara were included. In
                            the past, Rabat had implicitly accepted independence as one option,
                            provided the 20,000–25,000 Saharans it claims live in Morocco were
                            allowed to vote.</p>
                        <p>42. If Spain withdrew its troops prior to the referendum, Hassan might be
                            tempted to push across the border. If a referendum went against Moroccan
                            interests, Hassan might move to annex the territory forcibly, in the
                            hope that Algeria would not react militarily.</p>
                        <p>43. Morocco’s is the one claim that cannot be ignored. Hassan may be
                            staking out a maximum position in his recent pronouncements, but he will
                            need to show some gain for his efforts. He would, however, be willing to
                            meet Spain’s primary concerns. In exchange for recognition of Moroccan
                            sovereignty over the territory, Rabat has offered to make concessions
                            such as granting base rights for protecting the Canary Islands and a
                            joint venture with Spain to exploit the territory’s phosphate deposits.
                            While this solution would satisfy Spanish strategic interests and
                            Moroccan territorial claims, it would be unacceptable to Algeria and
                            Mauritania.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mauritania</hi></p>
                        <p>44. Mauritania is less interested in pressing its claims than in
                            countering Morocco’s. It has not forgotten that “greater Morocco” also
                            included Mauritania, and fears Rabat might not be satisfied with the
                            acquisition of Spanish Sahara. Mauritania’s primary concern is to avoid
                                <pb n="247" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_247"/>sharing a common border
                            with Morocco. A buffer state under Spanish or independent rule best
                            serves Nouakchott’s needs.</p>
                        <p>45. To date, the Mauritanians have been publicly cautious in reacting to
                            Morocco’s intensified campaign to recover Spanish Sahara. They have
                            previously relied on Algerian support to defend their interests. If
                            Algerian backing seemed to dwindle, however, Mauritania might well
                            undertake a diplomatic offensive on its own in Arab, <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, and Third World circles.</p>
                        <p>46. In early August the Mauritanian foreign minister publicly supported
                            self-determination for the peoples of Spanish Sahara even though the
                            area was “Mauritanian territory.” He later termed the Spanish referendum
                            proposal a positive step forward. He also reiterated an earlier call for
                            renewed consultation with Algeria and Morocco. Tripartite talks between
                            these countries have been held occasionally since 1970, but their
                            conflicting interests have prevented any agreement on practical steps to
                            hasten decolonization of the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>47. In an apparent attempt to revive these consultations Mauritanian
                            President Ould Daddah visited Algiers and Rabat during the second week
                            of August. At the end of his visit in Algiers, the government-controlled
                            press there published a carefully worded editorial that implicitly
                            criticized Moroccan tactics on the Saharan question, but avoided
                            outright rejection of Morocco’s claims. In Rabat, both heads of state
                            minimized their differences in public by agreeing to maintain contacts
                            regarding the liquidation of colonialism, while avoiding any reference
                            as to who gets what when the Spanish leave.</p>
                        <p>48. The military option is foreclosed to Mauritania unless it were to
                            receive substantial support from Algeria.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Algeria</hi></p>
                        <p>49. Algeria makes no territorial claims of its own to the Sahara,
                            although it has steadfastly maintained that it is an interested party
                            with political and security interests to protect. In keeping with its
                            carefully cultivated anticolonial image, Algeria has publicly supported
                            decolonization of the Spanish province.</p>
                        <p>50. The realities of Algeria’s position are far more complex; Spanish
                            Sahara is but one aspect of the larger problems of overall relations
                            with Morocco and Maghreb stability. The suspicious Algerian mentality
                            views all neighbors as potential enemies—especially Morocco, with a
                            political system and ideology that differs radically from Algeria’s. The
                            visions of an irredentist Morocco, which in the past laid claim to part
                            of Algeria, and memories of the 1963 border war have not faded. Rabat’s
                            failure to ratify an agreement signed in 1972 that renounced all
                            Moroccan claims to Algerian territory remains a sticking <pb n="248"
                                facs="0275" xml:id="pg_248"/>point in relations with Algeria, which
                            unilaterally ratified the agreement last year.</p>
                        <p>51. Thus far President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            has done nothing to oppose King Hassan’s current efforts to have the
                            Saharan issue settled in his favor. The Algerian leader’s preoccupation
                            with matters such as OAPEC oil policies, the Middle East question and
                            Palestinian rights, and various domestic issues may account for his
                            silence. He may prefer that the Saharan issue not come to a head now,
                            and may avoid taking a public stand for as long as possible.</p>

                        <p>52. Avoiding public involvement in the controversy does not mean that
                            Algiers will acquiesce to Moroccan annexation. Algeria does not
                            necessarily wish to see an extension of Moroccan sovereignty. Algeria
                            has large deposits of iron ore in the Tindouf region near the border
                            with Spanish Sahara and may eventually wish to export the ore through
                            the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>53. On the other hand, Algeria may view good relations with Morocco,
                            including Rabat’s ratification of the border agreement as more <pb
                                n="249" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_249"/>desirable than opposing
                            Morocco’s claim to Spanish Sahara. Moroccan aggrandizement in Spanish
                            Sahara would not significantly alter the strategic economic balance
                            between Morocco and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>54. Algeria cannot easily discount Mauritanian interests, however. The
                            relationship between <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            and Ould Daddah is close. Algeria values the concept of Arab solidarity.
                            In this arena, Mauritania matters as well as Morocco.</p>
                        <p>55. A senior Algerian official has indicated privately that Algiers
                            continues to support <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions
                            calling for self-determination for the peoples of Spanish Sahara. He
                            added that perhaps the best solution would be a referendum held under
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> auspices leading to independence,
                            guaranteed and supported economically by Spain and the three neighboring
                            African states. Although Saharans would have the option to merge with
                            Morocco, he expressed confidence that they would choose independence in
                            any fairly conducted referendum.</p>
                        <p>56. Algeria’s faith in the referendum results thus puts it against
                            Morocco which wants a referendum only under stringent conditions that
                            would not permit the option of independence.</p>
                        <p>57. Politically, Algeria is capable of foiling Moroccan designs for
                            enlisting Third World support on Spanish Sahara. If pressed to take a
                            stand, Algeria could use its considerable influence in the Arab League,
                            the Nonaligned Movement, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to mount a campaign in support of
                            self-determination as called for under existing <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolutions. When Algerian Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName> becomes president of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly this fall, he
                            will be in an ideal position to coordinate such an effort.</p>
                        <p>58. It is less clear, however, that Algeria would challenge Morocco, if
                            Hassan, frustrated in his attempts to achieve a political solution,
                            chose the route of military conquest. If Algerian and Moroccan forces
                            engaged in hostilities, the outcome would be unpredictable. Algerian
                            forces are better equipped and trained, but some Moroccan troops were
                            recently tested in the Syrian front. Also the Moroccans would be
                            fighting for the concept of greater Morocco, and they were the victors
                            in the 1963 border war.</p>

                        <p>59. Spain is searching for a compromise that will permit Madrid to appear
                            responsive to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions calling for
                            a referendum on self-determination and to preserve good relations with
                            the Arab world by conciliating Algeria and, to a lesser extent,
                            Mauritania. It also wants to maintain good relations with Morocco and
                            protect its economic investment in Spanish Sahara, and claims it needs
                            security guarantees to protect the approaches to the Canary Islands.</p>

                        <p>60. The proposal to hold a referendum under <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> auspices meets the concern over the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and possibly Algeria and Mauritania. An
                            agreement acceptable to Morocco best satisfies the remaining
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Referendum</p>
                        <p>61. Madrid’s decision to hold a referendum in the Sahara under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> supervision next year seems to have
                            committed Spain to this course of action. The three African parties
                            interested in the future of the territory will disagree on the terms for
                            such a referendum. Morocco may continue to insist on pre-conditions for
                            a referendum, such as omission of independence as an option, that are
                            unacceptable to Algeria and Mauritania. Even under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> auspices, it would be next to impossible
                            to ensure an honest referendum and the results might immediately be
                            challenged by one or another of the interested states. Moreover the
                            Saharans, including the ones in Morocco, may be less favorably disposed
                            to Morocco than Rabat assumes, and with Spanish encouragement may vote
                            against union with Morocco. Rabat claims it would reject anything short
                            of a clear vote for union with Morocco. Independence would create a
                            power vacuum with these same states competing for influence; armed
                            conflict would be difficult to avoid.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Guaranteed Agreement</p>
                        <p>62. Given the likelihood of instability, Madrid might seek prior
                            agreement among the neighboring states so that all four states would
                            have a vested interest in the new country, perhaps as guarantors of its
                            independence, and would provide economic assistance. This would allow
                            Spain to comply with existing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            resolutions and to shift considerable responsibility to the Africans for
                            ensuring the viability of an independent Sahara. Algeria prefers this
                            alternative and Mauritania would willingly accept it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Potential for Conflict</p>
                        <p>63. Morocco would oppose any agreement that permitted Spanish Sahara to
                            become independent. It fears an independent Sahara would be dominated by
                            Algeria and Mauritania; the former because it is an important political
                            actor in Arab and Third World arenas; the latter because it shares with
                            Spanish Sahara an ethnic and cultural identity.</p>
                        <p>64. Morocco would actively oppose this solution and might use tribesmen
                            in southern Morocco for guerrilla activity or regular ground forces for
                            limited commando raids. The Spanish would oppose such incursions but
                            would probably not retaliate across the Morocco border. Spain will
                            respond if attacked, but has little inclination to become embroiled in a
                            conflict defending a territory it has decided to relinquish.</p>
                        <pb n="251" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_251"/>
                        <p>65. Rabat could also exert pressure on the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and
                            Melilla in the north by cutting off water supplies and the flow of
                            tourists through these points into Morocco. Without water, they would be
                            difficult to defend and resupply would be costly. Spain might also react
                            militarily if seriously provoked.</p>
                        <p>66. Morocco might also make a military move if Spain withdrew its troops
                            after granting independence. Under these circumstances, Rabat would
                            gamble against Algeria’s attempting to counter its military advance. The
                            Algerian reaction is difficult to predict. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> believes that an Algerian-Moroccan military
                            confrontation would be a distinct possibility, although Algiers would
                            first exhaust all diplomatic options. State/INR believes Algeria’s
                            recent public silence on the Sahara question may well reflect an
                            unwillingness to provoke Morocco on an issue in which it has no
                            overriding interest. Moreover, INR finds no evidence to indicate that
                            Algeria has yet mounted a serious diplomatic campaign to thwart Moroccan
                            ambitions in Spanish Sahara. On balance (and admitting the paucity of
                            information available), INR considers that Algeria is not presently
                            contemplating hostilities with Morocco over this issue—notwithstanding
                            some indications of Moroccan apprehensions to the contrary.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiated Withdrawal</p>
                        <p>67. Failing an agreement on a referendum, Madrid may turn to direct
                            negotiations leading to an orderly withdrawal from Spanish Sahara.
                            Madrid might first seek a bilateral deal with Morocco. King Hassan has
                            reiterated his belief that this would be the best solution and has
                            suggested that such talks might be facilitated by a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mediator.</p>
                        <p>68. In exchange for recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the
                            territory, Rabat has offered to make concessions such as granting base
                            rights for protecting the Canary Islands and a joint venture with Spain
                            to exploit the territory’s phosphate deposits. While this solution would
                            satisfy Spanish strategic interests and Moroccan territorial claims, it
                            would be unacceptable to Algeria and Mauritania. The Algerians could be
                            expected to use every possible diplomatic means to block such an
                            agreement and might resort to force if they were not a party to a
                            settlement. Mauritania would follow Algeria’s lead.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Partition: A Possible Compromise</p>
                        <p>69. Faced with opposition to a bilateral settlement, Spain might draw
                            Algeria and Mauritania along with Morocco into a series of extended
                            negotiations. Barring a breakdown of talks, a compromise solution
                            partitioning Spanish Sahara might emerge that would:</p>
                        <p>—give Morocco the smaller northern region with its phosphate
                            deposits,</p>
                        <p>—guarantee Algeria transit rights for its mineral exports,</p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_252"/>
                        <p>—give Mauritania the larger southern portion containing iron ore, and</p>
                        <p>—grant Spain residual base rights and participation in the exploitation
                            of the area’s mineral wealth.</p>
                        <p>Such a compromise would seem to meet the interests of Spain, Algeria, and
                            Mauritania. Morocco wants outright annexation of all the territory, but
                            in the end it might be forced to settle for less to avoid a
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Interests</p>
                        <p>70. Spain’s importance to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is due
                            primarily to the strategic value of its geographic location at the
                            western entrance to the Mediterranean. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> has four major bases in the country as well as a variety
                            of communications facilities and reserve storage depots. There are
                            approximately 9,500 military personnel in Spain and some 37,500 American
                            citizens reside there. As of mid-1973, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> had provided Spain $836 million in military aid and
                            sales and slightly more than $1 billion in economic assistance under a
                            defense and economic assistance agreement first signed in 1953. American
                            direct investment in Spain is at least $900 million, with more than $100
                            million in new investment each year. To protect these interests, the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has maintained close bilateral
                            ties with Spain and encouraged Madrid’s general pro-Western political
                            and economic orientation, basic commitment to the defense of the West,
                            and ultimate participation in the EC and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>71. The Spanish claim a six-mile territorial sea and recognize only the
                            right of innocent passage through the Straits of Gibraltar; in practice
                            they have not questioned submerged submarines transiting the straits. A
                            six-mile territorial sea measured from the Spanish mainland and the
                            enclave of Ceuta in Morocco, together with the doctrine of innocent
                            passage, theoretically puts Madrid in a position to control the entrance
                            to the Mediterreanean thereby rendering Gibraltar useless to the UK or
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. In effect, the Spanish are
                            equally interested in observing Algerian and Moroccan activities from
                            these vantage points. Although the Spanish do not expect they would be
                            allowed to exercise such control, they can use their position to enhance
                            their bargaining position in a settlement of the Gibraltar dispute and
                            membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>72. Like Spain, Morocco’s strategic importance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> derives from its location at the western
                            entrance to the Mediterranean. An unfriendly government in Morocco could
                            threaten to extend its territorial waters and interpret strictly the
                            doctrine of innocent passage to impede free passage through and over the
                            Straits of Gibraltar. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has no
                            mutual defense commitments with Morocco. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> continues to operate two communications facilities near
                            Kenitra that support the Sixth Fleet under an oral executive agreement
                            made in 1963. There are approximately 1,100 military personnel and 1,500
                            private American citizens in Morocco. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            military assistance, grant and sale, totaled about <pb n="253"
                                facs="0280" xml:id="pg_253"/>$112 million through mid-1973, and a
                            major arms sales package is under consideration. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> economic assistance for the same period totaled about
                            $806 million, of which more than half consisted of loans. American
                            private investment is estimated to be $70 million.</p>
                        <p>73. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has only limited interests in
                            Mauritania. Washington has no important treaties or agreements with
                            Nouakchott. There is no fixed <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            investment in Mauritania, but <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil
                            companies engaged in exploration there have already spent some $20
                            million. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economic assistance through
                            mid-1973 totaled nearly $8 million. The total American presence there is
                            23.</p>
                        <p>74. Despite major policy differences on international political issues,
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> cooperation with Algeria has been
                            increasing in the economic field. The primary <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> interest in its relations with Algeria is to insure
                            continued access to Algeria’s natural resources through long-range
                            cooperation agreements. Algeria has the fourth largest proven reserves
                            of natural gas in the world and produces about one million barrels per
                            day of low sulfur crude oil. The <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> government is firmly committed to rapid
                            industrialization financed by the sale of oil and gas. It sees the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> as a major market for these
                            products and as a source of capital and technology.</p>
                        <p>75. Before Algiers broke relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> in June 1967, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had
                            provided $180 million in economic assistance, primarily grant food aid.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> direct investment is small but
                            Algeria offers an expanding market for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> goods and services. The total American community is
                            approximately 700.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Implications for the US</p>
                        <p>76. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has no important interests in
                            the Sahara. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Steel has not responded
                            to a Spanish approach to invest in the phosphate mining complex. Our
                            primary concern is the stability of the region. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has sought to remain on good terms with
                            all parties concerned and has expressed the hope for a peaceful
                            settlement between Spain and Morocco that takes into account the
                            concerns expressed by Algeria and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>77. Nevertheless, if such a settlement cannot be achieved, and Morocco’s
                            hardening position makes it at least questionable, the Spanish Sahara
                            issue poses certain problems for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.
                            The question of the referendum may well arise in the General Assembly;
                            Morocco has also indicated that it may ignore a <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolution to carry out the referendum if independence
                            for Spanish Sahara is included as an option. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> may be subjected to pressures from both Madrid and
                            Rabat.</p>
                        <p>78. As a major arms supplier to both Spain and Morocco, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is vulnerable to charges of aiding an
                            arms build-up in an unstable area.</p>
                        <pb n="254" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_254"/>
                        <p>79. If Morocco presses for annexation and fails, Hassan may be subjected
                            to internal pressures that could topple him.</p>
                        <p>80. A solution that would be acceptable to both Rabat and Madrid might be
                            in the best interests of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, since
                            Morocco’s is the claim that will not be dismissed. Such a solution,
                            however, might alienate Algeria and Mauritania and create problems with
                            other Third World countries for which the option of self-determination
                            is of the greatest importance.</p>

                            expressed you had very good relations with Rabat and Madrid so you’d
                            keep a neutral position. We did understand your position, and therefore
                            we were very surprised when we read in the <hi rend="italic">Washington
                                Post</hi>
                            <pb n="255" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_255"/>that it had been manifested
                            that the U.S. was in favor of a direct understanding between Rabat and
                            Madrid to turn over the Spanish Sahara to Morocco.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I never even read that
                            article, and it’s total nonsense.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: It was yesterday.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I never read the <hi
                                rend="italic">Washington Post,</hi> except the Sports Section and
                            the Style Section. Now that I’m married I can read it [the Style

                        <p>Our policy is what I’ve told you. What the policy of our Deputy Chief of
                            Mission there is, I don’t know. In fact, I don’t know what our <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> did here, but he won’t do it again.
                            The next time he does it he’ll have to do it from a longer distance. If
                            we have something to say to you about the Spanish Sahara, we’ll do it
                            directly. I don’t know who he is.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>: Coon.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What did he say?</p>
                        <p>Rivero: He gave the impression—it wasn’t clear whether he was speaking
                            for the Secretary but was giving his personal views.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What I’ve told you is
                            our policy. We have no particular view about the future of the Spanish
                            Sahara. I told you privately that, as a political scientist, the future
                            of Spanish Sahara doesn’t seem particularly great. I feel the same way
                            about Guinea-Bissau, or Upper Volta. The world can survive without a
                            Spanish Sahara; it won’t be among the countries making a great
                            contribution.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: Anyway, it should not be used against others.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There was a period in
                            my life when I didn’t know where the Spanish Sahara was, and I was as
                            happy as I am today.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: Before phosphates were discovered!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, if you work out
                            something with the King of Morocco, all right. But it’s not an American
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: What you’ve expressed to me is more than enough. But I want to
                            make clear we’ll make an effort to reach agreement with Morocco. But not
                            if our side gives 100 percent. We’re prepared to do something.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what?</p>
                        <p>Cortina: This is a general way of talking. We’ll have to sit around the
                            table and talk about it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Having negotiated with
                            you, I don’t think you give things so fast. That’s my impression.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: As you know, I like your sense of humor.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: First, the reason I’m
                            going to Rabat is because of Algeria, and given the fact the Arab Summit
                            is in Rabat, I didn’t think I could go to Algeria without going there.
                            And second, I’m going to Al<pb n="256" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_256"
                            />geria because we need <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> to help us with Syria and the radical Arabs.
                            So it has nothing to do with Spain. If we change our policy—which is
                            impossible—I will let you know. We won’t change our policy.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: The Moroccans will
                            raise it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And the Spaniards
                            have! You want my honest view?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: Yes, frankly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want it to go away!
                            I can’t get excited about 40,000 people who probably don’t know they’re
                            living in Spanish Sahara. I <pb n="257" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_257"
                            />hope you don’t think I’m too cynical. We have no interest in Spain
                            being there. It’s not logical for Spain to be in Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: What is your view on
                            self-determination?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m for it, but I
                            don’t think it’s natural for an entity so accidentally formed. So the
                            only question is what country exerts a dominating influence. We will not
                            be active in the area. What is your view? I’d be interested. The
                            Moroccans say you want to annex it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: To give us an outlet!
                            So our contacts would be easier! What’s your view?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the long run it’s
                            inevitable—leaving Spanish Sahara aside—that Algeria will become the
                            dominant power in the Magreb.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: In truth, so you’ll be
                            informed, we have no such ambitions. If we had, we would proclaim our
                            intention before the Algerian people. We are very much interested in
                            maintaining the unity of our own people. We have agreements with
                            Morocco, including in the oil area. So Morocco wants our support, and
                            Mauretania. In my talks with King Hassan, I said: “Don’t ask me to take
                            an immoral position.” There is an agreement between Mauretania and
                            Morocco. The Moroccans say publicly this is Moroccan territory. There is
                            an agreement with President Ould Daddah, and it was even mentioned by
                            the American press. I don’t know how it got the information.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it true?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That it’s
                            Moroccan-Mauretanian territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: We don’t want an
                            outlet.</p>
                        <p>We want to exploit the iron ore deposits, but we don’t want it to be a
                            point of conflict.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How can you exploit
                            the ore if it’s not your territory?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName>: The mines are on Algerian
                            territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will take no
                            position. Or should we? It involves no American interest.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: The Spaniards are our
                            friends. So the problem is between Morocco and Mauretania, not with
                            Spain. This is for history. Disagreement between Morocco and Mauretania
                            is postponing a solution on this. The inhabitants should decide.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would they know what
                            they are being consulted about?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: Some inhabitants are
                            Moroccan, some are Mauretanian, and some are nomads. There are some of
                            them in Algeria—but this doesn’t give Algeria any rights.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Could it be divided
                            between Morocco and Mauretania?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>: I think the attitude
                            is gradually evolving in the direction of division.</p>

                                        >Kissinger</persName> and King Hassan discussed Moroccan,
                                    Spanish, Algerian, and Mauritanian positions on the Spanish
                                    Sahara. King Hassan agreed to accept the decision of the
                                    International Court of Justice, but declared that he would move
                                    forces into Spanish Sahara if Spain granted it independence.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Spanish Sahara.]</p>
                        <p>Hassan: You are aware of our problem with Spain? There are already two
                            hot spots in the Mediterranean—one in the east and one in the center
                            with Cyprus. The United States is not interested in seeing the west also
                            becoming a hot point. It is in fact in no one’s interest. I have talked
                            about this with Lopez-Bravo who was by far the best foreign minister
                            Spain has had in recent years.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I fully agree. The present foreign minister (Cortina) is
                            to be avoided at all costs. He has the mind of a clerk.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: I told Lopez-Bravo that I agree that Spain remains but I do not
                            agree in the Spanish Sahara becoming independent. I prefer the Spanish
                            presence to self-determination for 30,000 people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> asked me yesterday what I thought about that
                            and I said self-determination for 30–40,000 people who do not even know
                            where they live?</p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_259"/>
                        <p>Hassan: What does <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            say?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: He is for self-determination. I assumed that he wanted an
                            outlet on the Atlantic but he said that he has absolutely no interest in
                            the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: This territory belonged to someone in the past, it is not <hi
                                rend="italic">res nullus</hi>. I seek the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> (International Court of Justice) decision, because I
                            know that they will say that this land belonged to Morocco before, and I
                            will in any event accept the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>
                            decision because the evidence that I submitted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> is very, very strong.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Many states are an absurdity, such as Guinea-Bissau or
                            Spanish Sahara, why are you so sure that the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> will rule in your favor?</p>
                        <p>Hassan: Our evidence is very, very firm. As recently as 1955 the French
                            official register listed the cities that were administered there as
                            being administered from the administrative centers of Morocco. So I am
                            willing to accept the ruling of the courts and, in addition, I must gain
                            time while Franco is there. To accept an independent state in the
                            Spanish Sahara is, all things being equal, like the United States
                            accepting the Soviet missiles in Cuba or like the Soviet Union accepting
                            the Czech situation. The same imperative applies in this case.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If I were in Your Majesty’s position, I would do exactly
                            the same thing. But the United States Government is sometimes acting
                            with more sentimentality and more legalism—look, for instance, at our
                            attitude on the Cyprus matter and the Congress’ actions vis-à-vis
                            Turkey. Be assured that I will cause you no problem on this matter. I
                            personally like the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> solution.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: Ask Spain not to turn down the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> solution. We are a small country, we have no
                            pretentions, I am very serious because my seriousness is my major asset
                            and capital. I lived in exile myself for three years. I know the methods
                            used by colonialist administrations, I know what passes for a referendum
                            and I know all about nationalism. If Spain moves to give independence to
                            Spanish Sahara, I prefer to tell you in the most candid terms, so that
                            you can stop supplying us with weapons, tanks, and airplanes if you
                            wish, but if at 10 o’clock Spanish Sahara becomes independent, I shall
                            move my forces and go in at 11 o’clock. I will not lie to you. If Spain
                            gives independence to that territory, within two years the place will be
                            full of Russian and Chinese revolutionaries. If Spain goes home, Morocco
                            will be surrounded on one side by the Atlantic and on the other side by
                            the Mediterranean and it will be surrounded by Algeria, Algeria and
                            Algeria on the three other sides.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> believes
                            that there is already an agreement between Morocco and Mauritania.</p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="0287" xml:id="pg_260"/>
                        <p>Hassan: Oh, but there is such an agreement. We have exchanged letters.
                            With Mauritania everything is settled, there is no problem. President
                            Ould Daddah will come to Rabat three days before the Summit and we will
                            make the announcement then. But I asked Spain to accept the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> formula. In a secret letter with Ould
                            Daddah, we have agreed on the zones of influence and Algeria has
                            absolutely nothing to say. Why is Algeria so anxious to have a port
                            outlet? It’s because the iron ore has to transit through Morocco.
                            Instead of concerning himself with how he can occupy Africa, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> should look to his own
                            domestic problems. His situation is not very good.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I understand your problem, but Your Majesty must
                            understand very clearly that the United States Foreign Service is
                            composed very largely of frustrated missionaries better suited to
                            conducting Sunday school than diplomacy and if you should be lectured
                            moralistically on the subject of the Spanish Sahara, I would want you to
                            talk to me directly first before you jump to any conclusions. I will
                            tell Spain about the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> solution. My
                            associates tell me that Your Majesty proposes the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> because you consider it inappropriate
                            to resort to force but want to use diplomatic and juridical methods. I
                            believe that you want to gain time.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: I am sure of the outcome with the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> and Spain must accept that formula.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Can we succeed?</p>
                        <p>Hassan: I am sure your intelligence tells you what many of my own staff
                            officers trained in Madrid and who have retained their contacts in
                            Madrid tell me, there is not a single Spanish soldier or officer who
                            wants to die for Spanish Sahara, particularly not after the Portuguese
                            experience. I do not like the use of force, but if there is no other
                            solution, I will.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: When will this matter come to a head?</p>
                        <p>Hassan: It may come in about a week, my understanding is that on October
                            28 Spain begins to gather the nomads to tell them that first, they will
                            receive internal autonomy which is a preliminary step to full
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: At what point will Your Majesty move?</p>
                        <p>Hassan: It will help me very much if this occurs during the Summit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do you conceive this consultation with the nomadic tribal
                            chiefs to be the beginning of the referendum?</p>
                        <p>Hassan: It is the beginning of the violation of Spain’s pledge to the
                            United Nations. All my friends in Spain recognize that Franco, who is
                            senile, has a fixation on the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="0288" xml:id="pg_261"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: I cannot say that my life will be incomplete if I do not
                            have one more military crisis.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: I don’t want to embarrass any of our friends, we will not ask
                            anyone to make a choice between Spain and Morocco. We are aware of the
                            large interests of the United States in Spain but after Franco passes on
                            you must review this strategy and perhaps you will then transfer some of
                            those interests to Morocco. There is no question of asking you to make a
                            choice. We are not asking you to choose one side or the other. This
                            concerns purely Spain and Morocco. Remember that the French had 180,000
                            soldiers in Morocco—we did not have one single rifle. The French have
                            left. Spain will leave also. We are ready to fight.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I will talk to Spain about the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Hassan: To do so would be a great service to peace.</p>

                        <p>1. Apparent renewed militance of King Hassan on Sahara issue as revealed
                            in French radio interview April 28 (Ref A) is cause for concern in
                            Department. As outlined in Ref C, Moroccan aggressiveness on territorial
                            claims against Spain complicates sensitive U.S.-Spanish relations,
                            because of responsive U.S. arms supply policy toward Morocco. Al<pb
                                n="262" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_262"/>though U.S. remains neutral on
                            merits of Moroccan claims it cannot, because of its military
                            relationships with both parties, remain neutral on modalities employed
                            to resolve the territorial disputes.</p>
                        <p>2. Accordingly, you should seek appointment with Foreign Minister Laraki,
                            to express <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> concern generated by
                            King’s remarks in French radio interview that Morocco may be changing
                            its approach in dispute with Spain from peaceful diplomatic and judicial
                            channels, as exemplified by <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>’s
                            successful proposal to refer Sahara question to <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>, to more militant posture. You should point out that
                            U.S. supports peaceful resolution of territorial disputes with Spain not
                            only to preserve stability in area, but also because U.S. military
                            relationships with both sides could cause obvious difficulties for U.S.
                            if other than peaceful methods are used.</p>
                        <p>3. You should also seek Laraki’s view on status of <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> adjudication of Sahara case and ask
                            him how <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> conceives of role <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> decision would play in final
                            resolution of question.</p>
                        <p>4. When exchange on Sahara is completed, you should tell Laraki you have
                            been instructed to express Department’s appreciation of King Hassan’s
                            confidence expressed to you in April 30 audience (Ref F) and in “<hi
                                rend="italic">Figaro</hi>” interview May 2 (Ref G) that U.S. could
                            emerge in strong position in post-Vietnam era. You should ask Laraki to
                            reassure King that U.S. intends to continue active involvement in search
                            for Middle East peace. Regarding King’s recommendation that U.S. should
                            move forward on Middle East in consultation with other permanent members
                            of U.N. Security Council, you should express appreciation for advice and
                            confidential note that as process of reassessment of U.S. Middle East
                            policy continues, we are in touch with UNSC permanent members on
                            bilateral basis. However, we have doubts about utility of Security
                            Council itself as effective forum for Middle East peacemaking.</p>
                        <p>5. For Madrid: You may inform <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> at
                            appropriate level of dé-marche in paras 2 and 3 above after Rabat
                            confirms that it has been made. You should also inform Ministry of Army
                            official quoted Ref B that U.S. is not providing Moroccan Army with any
                            kind of insurgency or infiltration training. You may also inform any
                                <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> officials who raise matter that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> continues to be sensitive to
                            Spanish concerns over our military supply relationship with Morocco. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> is aware of this <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> attitude and has not given <gloss

                            Rabat 3412; C) USUN 3321; D) Madrid 4949.</p>
                        <p>1. Department appreciates timely reporting, analysis and recommendations
                            on Sahara problem from various addressee posts. As seen from here issue
                            appears to be boiling down to question of modalities of transfer of
                            sovereignty of Sahara from Spain to Morocco and Mauritania in accordance
                            with the partition plan the latter two have devised and Algeria publicly
                            endorsed in <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>-Hassan
                            communiqué of July 4. Even though we have no firm details of the new
                            Algerian position, and we can assume Algeria is capable of pursuing
                            policies that might cause frustration to <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss>, Department believes that July 4 public declaration of
                            Algerian satisfaction with Moroccan-Mauritanian agreement on Sahara’s
                            future, Algerian publicity given to declaration, and King Hassan’s
                            stated conviction that there are no problems now with Algeria (Ref B)
                            tip scales significantly against Spanish view that Algeria has not
                            changed its policy (Ref D).</p>
                        <p>2. It appears to us that Spanish are pushing <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> sponsored four-power conference with Algerian
                            participation in hopes latter could be counted on to impede what <gloss
                                target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> probably sees as complete, and perhaps
                            humiliating victory for Morocco (and Mauritania) on Sahara issues. For
                            their part, Morocco and Mauritania are probably pushing three-power
                            conference with Spain precisely to nail down details of their apparent
                            victory before <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has opportunity to
                            perhaps make suggestions they might consider unhelpful to their
                            position. It would be understandable if Spanish pride is a major factor
                            in determining Sahara tactics. This could account for Madrid’s failure
                            to respond to King Hassan’s temptations of economic and security
                            arrangements if a deal is made before the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> state their
                            findings. Spain could and probably would respond to Moroccan/Mauritanian
                            pressure for deal by saying, with some justice, that it has no authority
                            to transfer sovereignty of Sahara to any country, this being the
                            responsibility of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_264"/>
                        <p>3. In light of the foregoing, Department sees no U.S. interests to be
                            served by getting involved in advice to Waldheim or interested parties
                            that could be interpreted as prejudicial to the policies or goals of any
                            of the parties. Threat of hostilities over Sahara has been sharply
                            reduced since Algerian-Moroccan declaration and issue seems headed for
                            resolution, given apparent growing Arab/African support, in favor of
                            Morocco and Mauritania. Probably best Spain can hope for is <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> involvement in process of transferring
                            sovereignty that will minimize effect on Spanish pride.</p>
                        <p>4. In regard to latter, Department does wish, however, to offer some
                            recognition of Spanish problem even though we are not prepared to depart
                            from our neutral policy. Action addressees should therefore carry out
                            following instructions:</p>
                        <p>A. For USUN—Ambassador Moynihan: You should thank Waldheim for informing
                            us and express our continuing interest in learning of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> or other efforts to resolve the Sahara
                            dispute peacefully. You should also reaffirm to Waldheim that U.S.
                            policy on the Sahara continues to be neutrality on the substance of the
                            issue and this extends to requests for support by interested parties for
                            various negotiating proposals that other parties might see as
                            prejudicial to their positions. However, you may add that our judgement
                            is that all parties have recognized that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> has some role to play in view of past <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions and the current <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> proceedings. You should then say that
                            the modalities would have to be worked out by Waldheim and the
                            interested parties, but we would like to be kept informed.</p>
                        <p>B. For Madrid—Ambassador Stabler: You should tell Under Secretary Rovira
                            that in appreciation of Spanish concern over the Sahara issue the U.S.
                            is communicating to Waldheim its keen interest in seeing a peaceful
                            resolution of the Sahara problem and asking Waldheim to inform U.S. on
                            diplomatic developments in that regard. We are also conveying our
                            judgement to Waldheim that all parties have recognized that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has some role to play in view of past
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions and the current
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> proceedings, but that the
                            modalities would have to be worked out by him and the interested
                            parties. However, in order not to prejudice its relations with any of
                            the interested parties the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has
                            decided to continue its policy of neutrality and not to endorse specific
                            proposals made by any of the parties.</p>
                        <p>5. For Rabat—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NRG_1">Neumann</persName>:
                            For reasons cited above, we see no advantage to be had by <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> offering to mediate between Spain and
                            Morocco as proposed in Ref B. However, we take this opportunity to
                            commend your comprehensive and expeditious reporting in Sahara dispute
                            as seen from Morocco.</p>

                                not declassified</hi>] such an attack may occur as early as next
                            Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>2. With the Spanish military still in the Sahara, a serious conflict
                            could develop. If Morocco loses this gamble, it could ultimately lead to
                            the downfall of the present government in Rabat. On the other side,
                            prolonged fighting and heavy Spanish casualties could provoke a
                            political crisis in Madrid. There is also potential for drawing Algeria
                            into the conflict. Mauritania, which also has claims to Spanish Sahara,
                            is likely to avoid any military involvement.</p>

                        <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] King
                            Hassan, under pressure from the military, has decided to invade Spanish
                            Sahara within the next three weeks. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] Morocco will attack in the Sahara when
                            Ramadan ends next Tuesday. The King is reportedly confident the invasion
                            will succeed because he believes that most of Spain’s troops are poorly
                            trained and will not fight.</p>
                        <p>2. King Hassan has pursued a high-risk policy on Spanish Sahara for some
                            time. Last August, he reiterated his intention to acquire Spanish Sahara
                            before the end of the year, with force if necessary. Although he
                            promised then to await an advisory opinion from the International Court
                            of Justice on Moroccan-Mauritanian claims to the territory, he may now
                            have decided to act in a moment of what he perceives as Spanish
                            weakness. There is also increasing anxiety in Rabat that the Court’s
                            decision may be ambiguous or unfavorable to Morocco and that the report
                            of a fact-finding mission of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Committee on Decolonization will favor independence for the territory.
                            Finally, it is possible that Hassan has concluded that armed
                            intervention will provoke favorable international mediation. To date
                            most Moroccans have supported Hassan’s position on Spanish Sahara, but
                            if a military gamble fails he could be in serious trouble and vulnerable
                            to a coup.</p>
                        <p>3. Rabat expects effective resistance only from some 5,000 Spanish
                            legionnaires in the Sahara and Spanish air force units stationed in the
                            Canary Islands and possibly from Algerian ground forces. The Moroccans
                            are skeptical that Algeria will intervene militarily, but Morocco
                            reportedly is arranging for a token presence in Rabat of troops from
                            Syria, Egypt, the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, and possibly
                            Saudi Arabia as a psychological deterrent to an Algerian military
                            reaction. We have no evidence, however, that other Arab troops are
                            arriving in Morocco, although small contingents could arrive quickly by
                            air without being detected. We doubt that most eastern Arabs would
                            involve themselves in a potential inter-Arab conflict except in a
                            mediating role, although the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> may be
                            an exception.</p>
                        <p>4. Morocco has kept approximately one fourth of its more than 55,000-man
                            army in southern Morocco since mid-1974, despite considerable supply
                            problems, and low troop morale because of the primitive <pb n="267"
                                facs="0294" xml:id="pg_267"/>conditions. We estimate that most of
                            the 12,000 to 15,000 Moroccan troops in the southern zone have been
                            tactical infantry, with some armor, artillery, and air defense units.
                            Although the army has established a command-and-support structure in the
                            south, the Moroccans would nonetheless face considerable obstacles in
                            launching and sustaining a major offensive against either Spanish or
                            Algerian forces.</p>
                        <p>5. Madrid could muster sufficient strength from its own forces to defeat
                            a Moroccan invasion. The Spanish have some 16,000 army and air force
                            personnel in the Sahara, with an additional 20,000 located nearby in the
                            Canary Islands. The Spanish have 51 medium tanks and 35 armored cars
                            that could provide immediate armored support. Spanish forces are
                            well-equipped and trained, compared to the Moroccan army. In terms of
                            air power, Madrid has more than 60 sub-sonic fighter-bombers immediately
                            available; two squadrons of F–5 tactical fighter-bombers and a total of
                            four squadrons of air defense command Mirage III and F–4C interceptors
                            are in reserve in Spain.</p>
                        <p>6. If he has decided in favor of war, we believe King Hassan has
                            seriously misjudged the likely Spanish response to an invasion. Although
                            Madrid does not want to remain in Spanish Sahara or fight a colonial
                            war, Spanish troops in the Sahara would resist a forcible eviction. At
                            the same time Madrid would call on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> to restore peace and ask Washington for its support. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> response to this request would
                            strongly influence Spain’s attitude toward accommodating the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> position in the current base
                            negotiations. The Spanish government would expect that longstanding
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Spanish defense cooperation
                            should justify at least <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> diplomatic
                            support, particularly if the Moroccans, contrary to early assurances,
                            employed <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-made weapons in any attack.
                            The Moroccans, on the other hand, will also look to us for at least
                            diplomatic support and react strongly to anything we do that might be
                            interpreted as favoring Spain. A position of strict neutralism is
                            probably about the most that King Hassan will tolerate without serious
                            strain in our bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>7. Initially, an armed conflict with Morocco would unite most Spaniards
                            and help the regime divert the public’s attention away from internal
                            problems. If the fighting dragged on, however, the war could become
                            another issue that would divide Spaniards. Divisiveness would also
                            appear in the military—heretofore the most stable element in Spanish
                            society—who eventually would disagree over the merits of fighting a war
                            for a territory the government has already announced it is prepared to
                            give up.</p>
                        <p>8. Algeria, which favors independence for Spanish Sahara, will probably
                            stop short of direct military intervention. It would, however, create as
                            many problems for Morocco as possible. We would expect Algiers to
                            support the POLISARIO Front, a pro-independence Saharan <pb n="268"
                                facs="0295" xml:id="pg_268"/>group, in waging a sustained insurgency
                            effort. Algiers might also move troops to Morocco’s northern border to
                            exert pressure on King Hassan and renew its support of Moroccan
                            dissidents. The Algerians would almost certainly mount an intensive
                            international diplomatic effort to denounce Moroccan aggression.</p>
                        <p>9. In the less likely event that Algiers did intervene with direct
                            military force, the Moroccans might achieve some initial success because
                            they outnumber the 4,000 to 6,000 troops estimated to be in southwestern
                            Algeria. The Algerian air force of some 200 combat aircraft could,
                            however, turn the tide against Morocco’s 40 combat aircraft, and play a
                            decisive role in support of Algeria’s ground forces, which are about the
                            same size as Morocco’s, but better trained and equipped.</p>

                            the momentum of diplomatic progress. We have always appreciated Your
                            Majesty’s understanding of our efforts.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of matters on which I have wanted to have an exchange
                            with you and have been thinking, if it would be convenient, <pb n="269"
                                facs="0296" xml:id="pg_269"/>of sending a representative to Rabat in
                            the next few weeks for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, I want to share with Your Majesty my concern over some
                            reports that I have seen recently which, if true, suggest that a
                            situation could develop in your part of this important area which would
                            be of concern to all who are working to bring greater stability to the
                            Mediterranean area. These reports suggest that the Government of Morocco
                            may be contemplating imminent military action in the Spanish Sahara
                            situation. I hope these reports are erroneous but felt I should
                            communicate urgently with you to convey my strong advice that, should
                            they be correct, Morocco not take such action. I think you should know
                            of our estimate that Moroccan military operations against Spanish Sahara
                            could lead to severe military and political disadvantages for Morocco.
                            Among other things, we would expect Spanish to appeal to the Security
                            Council in circumstances where many members of the Council would find it
                            difficult to defend any such military initiative.</p>
                        <p>You know from our past conversations that we have followed the dispute
                            over the Sahara closely and have always sought to be helpful where we
                            could without ourselves seeking to become a party to this dispute. We
                            will continue to do so. I shall be seeing Spanish Foreign Minister
                            Cortina here in Washington today, and this will provide an excellent
                            opportunity for me to speak directly to him about the situation in the
                            hope that some mutually satisfactory solution can be found.</p>
                        <p>Again, Your Majesty, I would welcome the opportunity for an exchange of
                            views on the important issues for which we share concern. My emissary
                            could review these with you at a mutually convenient time.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary: We have some information concerning a possible Moroccan
                            attack in the Sahara. I want you to know that we have urged the King of
                            Morocco not to do it, that is, not to do anything rash. We have warned
                            him against it and have urged him to negotiate, just as I urge you to
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: We are ready to do so, and we have said that we would do so.
                            However, it is important to maintain the form of a referendum on
                            self-determination with guarantees to negotiate and to give satisfaction
                            to the parties. Self-determination does not mean independence, although
                            that is one of the options included to give it credibility, but what the
                            people of the area will be called on to do is to show their preference
                            either for Morocco or for Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The problem is the people won’t know what Morocco is, or
                            what Mauritania is.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: Unfortunately, they have learned well from experience what those
                            countries are and they know what all the possibilities are.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We are ready to use our influence for negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: According to the news we have the Moroccan attack will not be
                            exclusively on the Sahara territory, but also against Algeria.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They can’t be that crazy.</p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_271"/>
                        <p>Cortina: I believe that, too.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I sent a message to the King urging him against
                            precipitate action.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: That is very important because, having supplied him with U.S.
                            arms, you have a capacity for influence that others do not have. He also
                            has arms from the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We have not given him many arms, about $20 million, I
                            think. In fact, we think he might receive a bad beating.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: Facts will tell, and I would not want to anticipate, but I hope
                            nothing happens because it would be very unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes, it would be very unfortunate, and we are trying hard
                            to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: What is unfortunate is that the King has recently become very
                            nervous, according to our information, because he wanted to resolve that
                            problem exclusively through his own diplomatic skills and without the
                            cooperation of the political parties or the Army, though he was trying
                            at the same time to manipulate them. Then too, populations from Algeria
                            and Mauritania are in the territory and that complicates the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If he has to negotiate with you he will be lucky to keep
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Cortina: He tried very hard with me last August to have us not inform the
                            United Nations of our decolonization plans, but I explained to him that
                            we had to do that.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb had requested the meeting in order to make a formal
                            presentation of King Hassan’s response to the Secretary’s message
                            counseling Moroccan restraint in the Spanish Sahara. The text of the

                                >Sisco</persName>. A verbatim account of the conversation
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: Mr. Secretary, it is a great joy to see you; it is a
                            great privilege to have this opportunity as I know how busy your
                            schedule is.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes,
                            unfortunately I am going to China.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: Yes, I know exactly what your schedule must be like
                            and I realize you only have a few minutes to see me.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, you
                            know I am a great admirer of your King.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: Of course he feels the same admiration toward
                            you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I hope you
                            will give him my very warm regards.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: He asked me to do the same for you. I am here, Mr.
                            Secretary to bring a message in reply to your letter of October 4.
                            However, this is only a formality as you have already received a report

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have read
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: Your question was whether Morocco was planning to
                            launch any aggression or a military assault in the Sahara. His Majesty’s
                            response was that there was no question of that. His Majesty’s speech
                            yesterday was further evidence that Morocco does not want war with
                            Spain. What the King has done is intended to be beneficial to the
                            institution of a dialogue with Spain so that the two nations can
                            cooperate toward a solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to give you the historical background of the case since I
                            have already discussed the matter at length with Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName>, and Hartman. I do wish to make the point,
                            however, that the Sahara had always been recognized by Spain as being
                            Moroccan. Over the years Spain had always asked the Moroccans to be
                            patient and to wait a little longer. It is only in recent times, incited
                            by the Algerians (on this point I wish to be absolutely frank), that
                            Spain completely changed its position. We believe that this is not
                            serving Spain’s interests, but rather that Spain is serving the
                            interests of a neighboring country which for reasons of its own is
                            striving for the creation of a fictitious national entity.</p>
                        <p>Morocco believes that Spain must be consistent with itself. Spain cannot
                            on the one hand refuse to recognize the existence of separatist
                            movements among the Basques and the Canary Islands and on the other hand
                            favor the creation of the separatist movement in the Sahara, even under
                            the guise of a so-called liberation movement. I reiterate that Spain has
                            to be consistent. Spain cannot very well refuse to consider
                            self-determination for Gibraltar and seek to impose a referendum for the
                            Sahara. Spain’s positions are totally inconsistent and illogical.</p>
                        <p>Morocco believes that both the opinion of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> and the report of the fact-finding mission have
                            supported Morocco’s contentions. The fact-finding team mentioned the
                            special nature of the Sahara. It is not a colonial territory where
                            decolonialization could take place according to the usual <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> methods. This territory is not a
                            separate entity but is actually part of another territory, and in such
                            cases territorial unity takes precedence over other considerations.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> opinion, I point out
                            that it declared that indeed ties and allegiances had existed between
                            the Moroccan sovereign and the Sahara at the time of the Spanish
                            occupation. Therefore Morocco believes that the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> upheld the Moroccan position on both questions put to
                            the Court—the terra nullius issue and the existence of legal ties
                            between Morocco and the Sahara. Morocco does not believe that one can
                            play with distinctions between allegiance and territorial ties because
                            there are many cases where only allegiance existed, especially in
                            countries which had no monarchs of their own. Where monarchs did exist,
                            in most cases allegiance was rendered to the sovereign. The fact <pb
                                n="274" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_274"/>that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> added that this issue should be
                            resolved through self-determination was outside of the purview of the
                            Court. The Court could resolve legal issues before it, but the rest was
                            political and not of its concern.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I hear you
                            and understand your views, but what is the hurry? Why could you not wait
                            a few weeks to see how the results of this juridical decision could be
                            translated into negotiations?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: Spain has consented to Algeria’s establishing in the
                            Sahara an artificial movement for the purpose of occupying the territory
                            and if we wait we will lose everything. Yesterday a Madrid news agency
                            reported that nine Moroccans and one member of F POLISARIO had been
                            killed in the Sahara. It is clear then that Spain is no longer
                            administering the territory but that another element is doing so.</p>
                        <p>We do not want war with Spain, but if Spain is handing the Sahara over to
                            dissident Moroccan elements and to outsiders, we think that we are
                            within our rights to ask the U.S., our friend, to help Morocco, its
                            friend, and to be actively sympathetic to Morocco’s cause. It is no
                            longer a question of choosing between Morocco and Spain, but of choosing
                            between Morocco and outside elements that wish to usurp what is
                            rightfully Morocco’s.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You know our
                            feelings of friendship for Morocco and our great admiration for the King
                            who has always shown friendship for us. This is, of course, a very
                            complicated time for us for a variety of reasons, including the fact
                            that I am leaving town today and won’t be available for a week, so let
                            me reflect about this and I will have to communicate with my associates
                            from the airplane. We hope that His Majesty could delay for some weeks
                            until we can see what diplomatic possibilities exist.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: I will transmit that advice to His Majesty but would
                            it be possible for the U.S. to institute a démarche on this subject with
                            Spain?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will do
                            that. We will be in touch and we will let you know what we will do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boutaleb: (Upon departure) Your original message noted that
                            you would be sending an emissary to Morocco to discuss matters with His
                            Majesty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, that
                            will be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>. He should
                            be in Morocco in about a week.</p>

                            called on me October 17 to personally deliver your response to my
                            message of October 4 expressing my concern over the developments in the
                            Sahara. I was gratified by your frank exposition of your government’s
                            position on the issue and by your reassurances that Morocco is not
                            contemplating military action.</p>
                        <p>3. I am aware of Your Majesty’s speech and I have noted your intention to
                            organize a civilian march into the Sahara. Particularly in view of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> opinion and the <gloss

                            resolution through diplomatic means. To reiterate what I said to
                            Ambassador Boutaleb on October 17, as you consider your plans for a
                            march, I hope you will allow a reasonable period of time to explore all
                            opportunities for a settlement which will avoid military or political
                            confrontation.</p>

                        <p>1. You should convey following message from me to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin message:</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I want to thank you for the time you took from your busy schedule to
                            receive Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> and to share your views so frankly with us. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> has given me a full
                            report of his and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1"
                                >Parker</persName>’s meeting with you, and I would like to comment
                            in particular on several points.</p>
                        <p>I very much appreciated your full explanation of Algerian policy with
                            respect to the situation in the Sahara. I agree with you that every
                            effort must be made to resolve this matter by political means and that
                            it should be dealt with within the framework of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>In this spirit, we supported the resolution recently adopted by the
                            Security Council asking Secretary General Waldheim to undertake
                            consultations with the interested and concerned parties.</p>
                        <pb n="277" facs="0304" xml:id="pg_277"/>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> told you, the
                            United States has taken no position on the substance of the Sahara
                            question, and we will continue to maintain a policy of non-involvement.
                            At the same time, given our friendly relations with all the parties, we
                            cannot be unaffected by developments with respect to the Sahara and for
                            this reason have long urged that a solution be found through amicable
                            means. We remain ready to help diplomatically, if opportunities arise,
                            in working for a solution within the framework of the United Nations
                            that will meet the basic interests of all the parties and contribute to
                            stability in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> conveyed essentially this same message to the
                            Government of Morocco during his visit there.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s long
                            planned visit coincided, as matters developed, with a round of bilateral
                            discussions between the Governments of Morocco and Spain in Marrakesh
                            and Madrid. As our public statements have made clear, we are not
                            involved in any way in those discussions and are of course playing no
                            mediatory role. We are pleased that Secretary General Waldheim is now
                            active at the request of the Security Council, and we support the
                            Council’s call for restraint and moderation in order to enable his
                            mission to be undertaken in satisfactory conditions.</p>
                        <p>I also welcomed your comments to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> in response to the views I asked him to convey
                            to you with respect to the Middle Eastern situation. I value the
                            insights you have always given me and can assure you that we take
                            seriously your advice about the importance of filling the void in the
                            negotiating process.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. President, I welcomed your positive comments about the
                            recent preparatory conference in Paris and I am pleased that you feel
                            that our bilateral relations are today very good. I can assure you that
                            we fully reciprocate your assessment in both these regards.</p>

                                    Waldheim’s proposal involved three principal elements: Spanish

                                    abandonment of the Green March; <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                        <p>5445. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName>.
                            Subj: Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>1. I saw Secretary General Waldheim, as you asked, and he gave me in
                            detail the current state of play on his efforts re Spanish Sahara. He
                            has developed a formula based on the West Irian precedent which has
                            begun to emerge based on his detailed consultations with Spain, Morocco,
                            Mauritania and Algeria. Its success is uncertain. You will see from the
                            description of the detailed proposal that it contains three principal
                            elements: (A) An announcement by Spain that it would withdraw from the
                            Spanish Sahara by 1 February 1976; (B) a Moroccan announcement
                            abandoning the march; and (C) the establishment of a temporary <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> administration whose task would be to
                            supervise the withdrawal and work out ways to consult the people of
                            Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>2. Waldheim says he has the agreement of both Spain and Algeria. And he
                            is awaiting the reply of Morocco and Mauritania which he expects this
                            evening. He believes that Morocco’s reaction will be influenced by two
                            considerations: Whether Hassan has concluded that it is no longer
                            possible to get a strictly bilateral deal with Spain, which Hassan
                            prefers; and whether some formula regarding consulting the people can
                            develop which the King can accept. Morocco’s initial reaction was
                            cautious. If Laraki from his talks with the Spaniards yesterday
                            concludes no bilateral deal is possible, Waldheim believes Hassan will
                            be tempted by his approach. I urged that intensified efforts be
                            continued since the date of the march was getting closer.</p>
                        <p>3. At present Waldheim has a special representative, a Frenchman named
                            Andre Lewin, who is shuttling between the parties trying to firm up a
                            formula acceptable to all concerned. One element of flexibility was
                            Cortina’s suggestion that the Spanish Saharan people be represented in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> administration for the temporary
                            period involved. Waldheim had in mind that perhaps 6 to 12 members of
                            the Spanish Saharan Assembly could be included.</p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_279"/>
                        <p>4. In connection with all of the above, he described, as he did with you,
                            the highly emotional state of <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> who is strongly against a bilateral deal
                            between Spain and Morocco. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> asked Waldheim to convey a direct message to
                            you that you should intervene with Hassan promptly and tell him to call
                            off the march. Waldheim said that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> used strong language. He quotes <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> as saying that Hassan is
                            playing with fire and that the march must be stopped since Algeria
                            cannot tolerate it. According to Waldheim <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> also added otherwise there will be a reaction
                            in the Middle East as well. Waldheim expressed hope that you would be
                            able to send some kind of a message to <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> which would confirm that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s concerns had been conveyed
                            to you and that we were taking them into account. While we cannot be
                            responsive to <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> in ways
                            he would consider adequate, I believe it is important that you send him
                            a message if for no other reason than your close personal relations with
                            him. I have discussed with <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> the contents of such a message, and he will be
                            drafting something for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>5. Following are the details of the Waldheim proposal. “Suggestions for
                            compromise emerging from the consultations with the Prime Minister and
                            Foreign Minister of Spain</p>
                        <p>“1. Spain would unilaterally announce that it would withdraw from the
                            territory by a specified date (the date mentioned was 1 February 1976).
                            It would request the United Nations to assume responsibility for the
                            decolonization of the Western Sahara as of that date and would declare
                            that, pending its withdrawal, it would take no action to change the
                            situation in the territory.</p>
                        <p>“2. In view of Spain’s undertaking to withdraw from the territory,
                            Morocco would announce that it had decided to abandon the march. Morocco
                            would also undertake not to take any action until the question had been
                            discussed by the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>“3. Both Morocco and Mauritania have cited Principle VI of General
                            Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) which provides that one of the ways
                            whereby a non-self-governing territory can be said to have reached a
                            full measure of self-government is by integration with an independent
                            state. However, according to Principle IX of that resolution, such
                            integration should come about as the result of the freely expressed
                            wishes of the people, their wishes having been expressed through
                            informed and democratic processes.</p>
                        <p>“4. If the parties agree, the United Nations could set up a temporary
                            administration in the Western Sahara with the following functions:</p>
                        <p>“(A) Supervise and assist the withdrawal of Spain;</p>

                        <p>3211. Subj: Spanish Sahara: President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s Views. Ref: Algiers 3210.</p>
                        <p>1. At 5:00 p.m. today received summons to go to Presidency immediately to
                            see <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>. He was in grim
                            mood and came right to the point. Said he had called me to convey urgent
                            message to you, which was that situation in area rapidly deteriorating
                            because of Spanish Sahara question and action by us was required to save
                            it. Algeria had followed policy of restraint and moderation but time had
                            come to decide whether or not that policy had been wise. Proof would be
                            actions of U.S., which must take steps to prevent Hassan from proceeding
                            with his march. He knew that we had maintained a position of neutrality,
                            but for us to say at this point we were neutral would no longer wash. No
                            one in region would believe that Hassan was going into the Sahara
                            without our blessing.</p>
                        <p>2. I attempted to interject at this point but he waved me aside and
                            continued, saying that Green March threatened not only stability of <pb
                                n="281" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_281"/>Mahgreb but of Arab world as a
                            whole, and if we were seriously interested, as we said we were, in
                            stability, we would take action at this point. If something was not done
                            problem would have ramifications far beyond simple Algerian-Moroccan
                            dispute. Everyone’s interests would suffer. He was asking <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName> to get in touch with you to
                            convey same message but he wanted to be sure that you got it one way or
                            another.</p>
                        <p>3. I said our capabilities as far as Hassan were concerned were severely
                            limited. Hassan had opened the bottle and now could not put the genie
                            back into it. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said
                            problem could be solved honorably for Hassan. Spanish were prepared to
                            get out at any time. Question was what regime took over from them.
                            Algerians simply could not accept that this be settled by invasion.
                            Waldheim had made some proposals which were now being discussed in
                            Madrid. I asked if Algerians accepted Waldheim proposal. He said, yes,
                            and they were going to announce their acceptance tomorrow. Spaniards
                            also accepted them. Mauritanians had said they would go along if unable
                            to resolve problem through bilateral negotiations. There remained
                            Morocco. What was required now was a little push from the U.S. to make
                            Hassan accept the Waldheim proposal.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I would convey message to you immediately but that I must
                            repeat that our capabilities with Hassan were limited. King had
                            indicated to <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> that he
                            was on road from which it would be impossible to turn back. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said, quote then let him
                            continue unquote, and terminated meeting.</p>
                        <p>5. Comment: As noted above, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> was in grim mood. Do not know what he will do
                            if Green March continues. His military and political options are
                            limited. He can support guerrilla movement in Sahara and subversive
                            activities in Morocco and can cause considerable trouble, but he is
                            unlikely to take on Moroccan Army at this point. His frustration,
                            however, will lead him to strike out at other targets, including us.
                            Estimating damage he can or will inflict difficult. We think he unlikely
                            cut private economic ties, which very important to Algerian economic
                            development, but he will start playing spoiling role in Middle East and
                            will sharply reverse trend of improvement in our relations. This
                            implicit in his remarks in para 2.</p>
                        <p>6. More important in long run is fact that if Green March goes forward a
                            number of people are going to be killed and North Africa likely be
                            de-stabilized for some time. Situation may well get out of hand, with
                            demands for our intervention by one side or another putting us in an
                            increasingly embarrassing position. In other words, march is not going
                            to settle problem, but only make it worse. I think it very much in our
                            interest to find way out for Hassan. Algerian acceptance of Waldheim <pb
                                n="282" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_282"/>proposal offers one
                            possibility. It may only delay the agony, but it may also give enough
                            time for parties to work out solution between them.</p>
                        <p>7. I therefore recommend that if, as <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> says, Spanish accepted Waldheim proposal, we
                            also support that proposal in Security Council.</p>
                        <p>8. Recommend above be repeated Madrid, Nouakchott, Rabat and USUN.</p>

                        <p>1. Please convey following message from me for King Hassan.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text:</p>
                        <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                        <p>I very much appreciate your courtesy in receiving Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> last week in
                            Marrakesh. I am grateful for your counsel and support with respect to
                            the Middle East negotiations. I also welcomed your views on the Sahara
                            situation, which have given us a full appreciation of Your Majesty’s
                            policy and objectives in this respect. We want to be helpful in any way
                            we can, within the framework of the United Nations, to achieve a stable
                            and amicable negotiated outcome, and it is in this spirit that I am
                            writing you today.</p>
                        <p>I want to report to Your Majesty that I have received a message from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> expressing
                            deep concern over the potential consequences if the proposed march to
                            the Sahara goes forward.</p>
                        <pb n="283" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_283"/>
                        <p>I also want to inform you that we have now discussed with Secretary
                            General Waldheim the results of his recent mission, and he has described
                            to us his efforts to find a formula which could provide the basis for a
                            reasonable solution in the Spanish Sahara. After considering the formula
                            which the Secretary General is proposing, it occurs to us that Your
                            Majesty might find such a process acceptable. I would appreciate very
                            much knowing what Your Majesty’s views are and how Your Majesty intends
                            to proceed in relation to this formula. Meanwhile, now that matters seem
                            to be moving in the direction Morocco has been seeking, I am sure Your
                            Majesty will agree that it is important for all of us to exercise
                            continued patience and give the Secretary General all possible support
                            in these efforts. We believe they are promising and hope that this
                            matter can be pursued in an atmosphere of calm in your area which will
                            be conducive to a peaceful resolution.</p>
                        <p>I hope Your Majesty will agree that action such as the proposed march to
                            the Sahara, which would inevitably increase tension despite your best
                            efforts to the contrary, might prove unsettling to the hopeful process
                            now underway.</p>

                            was day before, but still maintaining Hassan’s march into Sahara will
                            have to be stopped, or area stability will suffer seriously. Implies
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests at stake. Thinks
                            Waldheim proposal offers way out for Hassan, but unwilling spell out
                            scenario he envisages. End summary</p>
                        <p>2. Delivered message in <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> at 12:30 today.
                            Found him in somewhat more relaxed and friendly mood than he was last
                            night but his position the same. He feels responsibility for future
                            development Sahara problem rests with United Nations and United States
                            and that all we have to do is give a quote little push unquote to Hassan
                            to get him to adjourn march.</p>
                        <p>3. When I had finished reading message to him <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> expressed appreciation for it and asked
                            whether I thought you were really working on this problem. I said you
                            had had a number of other pressing matters preoccupying you but that I
                            had conveyed last night’s message by special channel and was certain you
                            had focused on it and were making a sincere effort to resolve problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> then launched into
                            long philosophical discussion of problem.</p>
                        <p>4. He said that Moroccan actions threatened to upset area equilibrium, an
                            equilibrium for which Algerians largely responsible. In an earlier
                            conversation with you he had asked what we were seeking in the area and
                            you had said we were seeking strong, independent national governments.
                            That was in accord with Algerian goals and for that reason he had been
                            prepared to go along with our policies. We had experienced Ben Bella and
                            knew what he was like. 1965 had changed all that and Algerians had
                            followed moderate course. Problems such as Vietnam might have caused
                            considerable irritation but had not affected basis of our relations
                            (implication was that Sahara would). In interest good neighborliness and
                            stability Algerians had not exploited opportunities such as those
                            presented by coup attempts in Morocco. The balance which had been
                            maintained was now threatened however and results could not be foreseen.
                            If the United States wanted to maintain that balance we should get
                            Hassan to call off his march. He was convinced that we could do so.</p>
                        <p>5. I reiterated my comments of night before to the effect that our
                            influence was limited and said that what he was asking for was not
                            something to be done with a little push. I noted that responsibility for
                            the affair rested primarily with the participants: Morocco, Spain,
                            Mauritania and Algeria. King Hassan had all of us in impasse and we
                            gathered he thought that to withdraw from his project now would be
                            tantamount to committing suicide. Problem was how to find graceful way
                            out for Hassan. Did <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            have any suggestions?</p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_285"/>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said he thought
                            Waldheim proposal offered graceful way out. Let it be announced that
                            Spain was turning the colony over to the United Nations as of a fixed
                            date. This would mean the end of imperialist control and Hassan could
                            proclaim this a victory and disband the march.</p>
                        <p>7. I asked what <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            envisaged as subsequent scenario. He said something would have to be
                            worked out within <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. I said this
                            presumably would involve self-determination and that was something
                            Moroccans had indicated they would oppose.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said these were
                            political problems he should not have to solve. Point was that Hassan
                            had gotten himself into impasse. There was an honorable way out. It
                            would pose certain risks for Hassan, but the course he was planning to
                            pursue now posed even greater risks. What was Hassan going to do after
                            he got to El Aiun? Hassan had not thought this through. People were
                            going to be killed and armed struggle was going to begin and the end was
                            nowhere in sight. Algerians had avoided causing trouble for Hassan in
                            past, but they knew how to do so.</p>
                        <p>9. I noted that in conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> had said Spanish Sahara would be economically
                            viable. Did he have any thoughts about political viability? He said
                            again that this was not really his problem. There were decisions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> calling for exercise of right of
                            self-determination. These decisions would have to be honored. This was
                            the only possibility we had for peaceful settlement. Let Moroccans do
                            their best to win Saharan people over to their side. They were already
                            spending a lot of money to that end. They could continue to do so and
                            perhaps Sahraouis would vote to be part of Morocco. Alternative was
                            ultimately armed struggle, and soldiers could not solve anything. If
                            Moroccans concluded they had no alternative but to go ahead with march,
                            let them do so in full knowledge that the responsibility for what
                            happened would lie with them. It was not in Morocco’s interest to be in
                            conflict with the Algerian revolution, but the Algerians were not afraid
                            of such a conflict if it came to that. They were revolutionaries and
                            they were accustomed to fighting. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> had no throne to lose. If he disappeared
                            another struggler would take his place. He was not in situation Hassan
                            was. He did not have to export his trouble.</p>
                        <p>10. Comment: Am having trouble deciding what to make of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s remarks and attitude. Am
                            sure he means what he says and should be taken seriously, but he is
                            being prudent and making no direct threats and burning no bridges. This
                            presumably reflects the limited options he has and his position may not
                            be as strong as he would like to have us believe, particularly given
                            support Moroccans seem to have received from other Arabs.</p>

                        <p>11. I believe tone taken in your message was just right and recommend we
                            maintain that posture. Hope way can be found to make Waldheim proposal
                            acceptable to Moroccans as well as others.</p>

                        <p>1. Cortina has just called me to request that I pass to the Secretary the
                            following.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> has tried through all possible
                            means to reach agreement with Morocco. When “Green March” announced,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> had endeavored to find ways to
                            remove this point of friction. However, Moroccans insisted that
                            substance of Sahara problem must be resolved along lines desired by
                            Morocco and maintained “Green March” not negotiable.</p>
                        <p>3. Moroccans have proven themselves impossible to deal with since their
                            idea of negotiation is that other side must accept Moroccan demands or
                            no agreement possible. <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> has
                            exhausted its possibilities.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> has now received information
                            which it considers accurate that amongst “Green Marchers” there are
                            25,000 men who are members of Royal Moroccan Army and who have their
                            weapons concealed. This group constitutes a “Trojan Horse” and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> is convinced that once across Saharan
                            border these soldiers will then take up their arms and military invasion
                            will be on.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> has already informed Security
                            Council that Spanish armed forces in Sahara have been given orders to
                            resist any efforts to invade the territory. Hassan is playing with his
                            throne by using Sahara to dis<pb n="287" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_287"
                            />tract Moroccan public opinion from domestic problems. However, Spain
                            does not intend to pay for Hassan’s errors.</p>
                        <p>6. Cortina believes <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> can play a most
                            important role in making Hassan understand that route he is following is
                            not the one which will get him what he wants. It will only radicalize
                            problem and produce a conflict we all want to avoid.</p>
                        <p>7. Security Council resolution, particularly one shortly to be adopted,
                            can provide cover for démarche to Hassan. Perhaps <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> could stress again that armaments which
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has provided to Hassan are for
                            fight against common enemy, but not for a fight which will involve
                            Western countries. Thus, while Security Council may have adopted
                            resolutions, each country should be able to interpret to Hassan its
                            views on how best to achieve objectives of these resolutions which,
                            quite correctly, have not pushed Hassan to wall by condemning Morocco.
                            He was convinced new resolution by itself would have little effect on
                            Rabat. Cortina gave me to understand that he would also be approaching
                            French and Italians to make representations in Rabat.</p>
                        <p>8. Cortina said grave urgency of problem lies in fact that “Green March”
                            with its “Trojan Horse” is due to cross into Sahara on Tuesday, November
                            4. He appealed to Secretary to do whatever he can to avoid the tragic
                            consequences which will be inevitable if the march proceeds. He
                            concluded by repeating two points: A) as he had promised Secretary,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOS_1">GOS</gloss> had made every effort to
                            negotiate, but had now exhausted its possibilities; and B) “Green March”
                            is nothing more than a cover to place the Moroccan Army in the Sahara
                            and thus to invade this territory militarily.</p>
                        <p>9. I told Cortina that I would pass above immediately to Department. I
                            also told him that I had tried unsuccessfully to reach him yesterday to
                            pass on contents of <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss>. Cortina
                            expressed appreciation for these efforts, but repeated he placed great
                            confidence in what Secretary might still be able to do to help at this
                            most dangerous moment.</p>

                        <p>259602. Subject: Message for King Hassan—Spanish Sahara. For Ambassador
                            from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Please convey following message from me to King Hassan:</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text: Your Majesty: Since I last wrote to you we have received
                            an urgent expression of concern from the Spanish Government that the
                            proposed Green March will include military elements and that this could
                            lead to a confrontation with tragic consequences. Our impression is that
                            the Spaniards still desire a negotiated solution to this problem
                            provided it is one in which the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> plays
                            a constructive role so that Spain will be seen as having fulfilled its
                            international responsibilities. We are encouraging the Spanish
                            Government to continue negotiations with you. I believe the position of
                            the Spanish Government deserves to be taken into account particularly in
                            the light of the present difficult domestic situation which it faces.
                            These considerations reinforce the need which I emphasized to Your
                            Majesty in my last message, that there be a period of patience and calm
                            during which bilateral and multilateral diplomatic efforts might bear
                            fruit. In particular we would encourage you to give serious
                            consideration to the proposals by Secretary General Waldheim. This would
                            be consonant with and responsive to the resolutions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council including the
                            resolution adopted by consensus November 2. The exercising of patience
                            and calm on the part of your government would be an act of statesmanship
                            of the kind that we have learned to expect from Your Majesty. Warm
                            personal regards. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry A.

                        <p>My dear Mr. Secretary and friend,</p>
                        <p>“The analysis of recent developments in the problem of the Sahara at the
                            United Nations as in other capitals has led us to the conclusion that
                            the obstinacy and intransigence with which Algeria continues to defend a
                            policy which is as unexpected as it is paradoxical does not correspond
                            to a simple concern to insure the principle of self determination.</p>
                        <p>“In reality we are more and more convinced that this policy is inspired
                            from the outside and corresponds to a collusion of interests which has
                            shown itself notably in the course of the debates in the Security
                            Council between Algeria and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>“It seems to us that the Soviet Union is seeking to create a focus of
                            tension in this area to try and intervene in the Western Mediterranean
                                <pb n="290" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_290"/>at a time when its
                            influence is more and more diminished in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>“If this analysis is correct and we have every reason to believe that it
                            is, the problem assumes a dimension of international concern which in
                            our opinion renders an action by the United States highly desirable.</p>
                        <p>“Please believe Mr. Secretary and my dear friend the assurance of our
                            consideration and sincere friendship.</p>

                            delivered what sounds very much like an ultimatum for Security Council
                            to get Moroccans out of Sahara. Makes no explicit threats but implies
                            Algerians will take military action if something is not done. End
                            summary</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassadors of states who are permanent members of Security Council
                            were summoned to Presidency this afternoon to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> and be given oral démarche
                            which seems to have followed consistent pattern for all of us. I was
                            last to go, at 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was courteous but
                            grave and said he had question he was posing to permanent members of
                            Security Council and that was what they were going to do to implement
                            Council’s decision taken this morning calling on Hassan to stop Green
                            March. Hassan’s people had crossed frontier. They had prayed. They had
                            gathered earth to take home. Now the party was over. It was time for
                            Hassan to take his people home, otherwise situation in area was going to
                            deteriorate rapidly.</p>
                        <p>4. He said, quote I want you to ask the doctor where he is. Where is
                            Doctor <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>? Nothing you
                            can say to me will convince me the United States cannot stop this affair
                            immediately. All you have to do is send a message to Hassan saying stop
                            and he will stop unquote.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said Algerians did
                            not want armed struggle but could not accept fait accompli which would
                            upset stability of area. Failure to stop Hassan now and send him home
                            would mean getting off a conflagration in which everybody’s interests
                            would be affected. He was making particular appeal to United States
                            because he felt we were the greatest of the powers and had the most
                            influence on Hassan. <pb n="292" facs="0319" xml:id="pg_292"/>British
                            did not count for much. As for French, he knew very well what their role
                            had been. They had put much pressure on Spain to give in to Morocco. He
                            did not expect much from them. He had also heard, and it was possible
                            that his information was incorrect, that certain circles in the United
                            States at the beginning of the affair had also put similar pressure on
                            the Spanish. I expressed surprise at this and he said he did not mean
                            the Secretary or the President. He meant quote other people unquote. (I
                            do not know what he is talking about.)</p>
                        <p>6. He then said quote ask the Moroccans how many men they have lost.
                            There have been armed clashes between them and the rebels (<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>) and there have been prisoners taken and
                            officers killed. Ask them how many. They deny that anything has happened
                            and are trying to cover up but we know that these incidents took place.
                            This is the last time I will talk to you about the Sahara. I am not
                            going to repeat what I said in our recent conversations but you know our
                            position. We want an answer from you that is clear and unequivocal. We
                            have discussed how to find a way out of the impasse for Hassan and this
                            is the last chance to do so. He must turn his people around and send
                            them home. Unquote</p>
                        <p>7. I said that I had impression that Moroccans were keeping to restricted
                            area between Spanish defense lines and northern border. I also had the
                            impression that Hassan would in a few days tell everybody to go home.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> asked if I really
                            thought Hassan was going to take the people out of the Sahara and go
                            home in two or three days. I said I had no hard information but only an
                            impression. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said he
                            did not want impressions he wanted facts.</p>
                        <p>8. I said that we had urged restraint on Hassan last week and noted that
                            we had supported the Security Council resolution. Unfortunately,
                            Hassan’s head was in the clouds and he was not listening. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> said he knew what our
                            position had been so far and he appreciated it, but it was now time for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the other permanent members
                            of the Security Council to do something concrete. Otherwise Council
                            would prove that it was ineffective and the same sort of incidents would
                            be occurring all over the region as people took the law into their own
                            hands. He assured me again that this was the last time he was going to
                            talk about this problem and terminated the meeting.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: While <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> made
                            no explicit threats, what he said sounded very much like a quiet
                            ultimatum. Have compared notes with the French Ambassador and we both
                            have impression from <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s
                            remarks that if there is no action soon to get Hassan out of the Sahara
                            the Algerians are going to involve selves directly, i.e., militarily, in
                            the affair. I note various SRF reports indicating that Algerians have
                            stationed substantial forces in border areas and are in position to move
                            against Morocco. I have no doubt now that they will do so if <pb n="293"
                                facs="0320" xml:id="pg_293"/>Hassan does not recall his people. I
                            think there is still time for the situation to be saved, but not a great
                            deal.</p>
                        <p>10. It is difficult of course to deal with simplistic Algerian approach.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is unwilling to
                            listen to any explanations we may want to give him about our inability
                            to control Hassan. I hope however that we can somehow convince Hassan
                            that the Algerians mean business and that he had better get his people
                            out of the Sahara quickly unless he really wants a military
                            confrontation with Algeria.</p>

                        <p>264586. Subject: Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>1. We have been reviewing what, if any, additional steps we might take to
                            help defuse the increasingly volatile Sahara situation. Department still
                            wishes to keep us out of the middle of this dispute and keep <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in forefront. Of course, we are mindful
                            of failure of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> efforts thus far and
                            Moroccan reluctance to follow any route other than bilateral
                            negotiations with Spain. However, in view of latter’s insistence that
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> be involved, which, of course, is
                            also an Algerian requirement, we think there may be a way of squaring
                            the circle.</p>
                        <p>2. What we have in mind is a proposal by Waldheim that Morocco and Spain
                            engage in bilateral negotiations under his auspices and with his
                            participation (much along the lines of the formula followed in the
                            Cyprus communal talks). This would permit Morocco to say that bilateral
                            negotiations are taking place but would provide Spaniards and Al<pb
                                n="294" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_294"/>gerians an element of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> involvement. For such effort to be
                            successful, terms of reference of talks should probably not be
                            precise.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe SYG already has enough authority under existing resolutions
                            to make such a proposal to the parties inasmuch as he was asked in
                            several recent resolutions to “consult with the parties concerned and
                            interested and report to the Security Council on the results in order to
                            enable the Council to adopt any further appropriate measures that may be
                            necessary.” Thus, we do not think it would be necessary for him to get
                            further specific authorization from the Council although he would, of
                            course, report to the Council when and if he receives the parties’
                            consent.</p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly, request you see Waldheim urgently. You should tell him we
                            do not want any indication given that this suggestion has originated
                            with <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. However, in reviewing the state
                            of play we conclude that about the only possibility we see of reversing
                            the present trend toward a conflict would be for him to take an
                            immediate and vigorous initiative proposing that Spain and Morocco
                            undertake negotiations under his auspices. Ideally, the Moroccans would
                            treat this proposal for bilateral negotiations as adequate grounds for
                            withdrawal of the marchers, which could well be sine qua non for
                            containing Algerian objections to such a proposal.</p>
                        <p>5. If he asks whether <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> would actively
                            support such effort you may say we would be as helpful as we can;
                            however, he should understand that our own efforts with Hassan have been
                            of no avail thus far, and he might consider seeking assistance from a
                            country like France which has so far not been engaged, but which has
                            special influence and special relations with the parties to support his
                            proposal.</p>

                        <p>1. Events of the last several days point to the increasing likelihood of
                            serious fighting between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front
                            that could draw in Spain and Algeria if the negotiating process now
                            underway does not soon succeed.</p>
                        <p>—Several clashes have been reported, and some confirmed, between Moroccan
                            irregulars and Polisario Front guerrillas in northeastern Spanish
                            Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> has warned
                            that, unless King Hassan halts the mass march into Spanish Sahara begun
                            on November 6 and withdraws his marchers soon, a conflagration will
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>—Yesterday morning Colonel Dlimi, commander of Morocco’s southern
                            military zone, ordered an army intervention group, probably consisting
                            of two battalions with supporting artillery, to proceed directly to two
                            towns, Jdiria and Hausa, that are in north central Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Algeria reportedly closed its border with Morocco yesterday.</p>
                        <p>—King Hassan may feel obligated to advance beyond the limited zone agreed
                            upon with Spain as a result of the publication of their agreement. A
                            second column of marchers reportedly has crossed the border some 50
                            miles east of Tah and a third column may be heading for northeastern
                            Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>2. The Spanish have some 16,000 army and air force personnel in the
                            Sahara, an amphibious landing force off the coast near the border, and
                            an additional 20,000 located nearby in the Canary Islands. We expect the
                            Spanish to resist forcibly any Moroccan military units encountered; they
                            are likely to resist efforts by the marchers to go beyond the <pb
                                n="296" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_296"/>border area, although they may
                            be becoming more flexible on this issue. Spanish forces in or near the
                            area are capable of inflicting a severe defeat on the 15,000 man
                            Moroccan military force deployed in the border area. Spain will also
                            seek a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution denouncing Moroccan
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>3. Algeria is estimated to have about 6,000 men based near Tindouf in the
                            tri-border area. There have been reliable reports, however, that
                            Algerian units along the Moroccan border have been reinforced over the
                            past several weeks. Algerian forces are superior to Morocco’s in
                            virtually every category and could win any long term struggle.</p>
                        <p>4. The Algerians have two major options in responding to the Moroccan
                            intervention in Spanish Sahara:</p>
                        <p>—Algiers can exert strong diplomatic pressure on Spain while enlisting
                            international support in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                            providing increased military aid to Polisario forces.</p>
                        <p>—Algiers can intervene militarily in Spanish Sahara to oppose Moroccan
                            forces there or move across its long western border with Morocco to gain
                            a bargaining chip for a Moroccan withdrawal from Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>We believe that Algeria is more likely to opt for the former rather than
                            direct military intervention. But if the more indirect action is not
                            effective, the likelihood of direct intervention increases.</p>
                        <p>5. President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is now
                            under some domestic pressures and has put his prestige on the line.
                            Although he has carefully avoided making public statements committing
                            himself to specific courses of action or timetables and can, therefore,
                            pull in his horns more easily than Hassan can, if he backs down
                            militarily he may expose himself to internal criticism. A successful
                            outcome for Algeria, on the other hand, would strengthen <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> at home and enhance
                            Algeria’s international credentials.</p>
                        <p>6. A military confrontation with either Spain or Algeria is likely to
                            have serious consequences for King Hassan. A military defeat would
                            unleash strong political currents inside Morocco that would create
                            domestic instability for some time to come and would probably lead to
                            his overthrow.</p>
                        <p>7. Any fighting in the Sahara would present potential problems for the
                            Spanish government. A quick and decisive Spanish victory over regular
                            Moroccan troops would be a political windfall for Juan Carlos. On the
                            other hand, prolonged fighting with heavy Spanish casualties would be
                            divisive within the government and undermine his position.</p>
                        <p>8. No matter what the outcome, all three countries are likely to blame
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> for not having used sufficient
                            diplomatic pressure to avert the crisis.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s talk about the
                            Sahara. You should know we put no pressure on Spain for any particular
                            solution. In fact, we attempted to dissuade the King [Hassan] from
                            marching in.</p>
                        <p>Did you hear what Moynihan said? He said if the Russians took over the
                            Sahara, there would soon be a shortage of sand. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>We frankly want to stay out of the Sahara question. It is not a heroic
                            posture.</p>
                        <pb n="298" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_298"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I think if we want to
                            address the problem correctly we are obliged to speak frankly, and
                            directly. The problem of the Sahara is a precedent for the world and is
                            a problem which is important also for the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why for the Middle
                            East?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: If there is an accord
                            between Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Israel, do you think also that the Arab
                            world would abandon the Palestinians? It is the same problem. You can’t
                            abandon the people of Sahara, or anymore the people of Namibia.</p>
                        <p>We have Morocco and Mauritania involved, and they try to settle it. Now
                            there is a decision of the International Court of Justice.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It was ambiguous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: No, it considered each
                            side’s brief in detail and came out for the one peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t know what
                            self-determination means for the Sahara. I can understand it for the
                            Palestinians, but it is a slightly different problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: The population of
                            Qatar is no more important.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But they had a sheikh.
                            They had an independent state.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: But they can be
                            independent also. Have you been to Dubai?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. Because our
                            security people think my reception would be too enthusiastic. They won’t
                            let me. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I don’t think either
                            side—those who encouraged you or those who discouraged you—have any
                            right to do so. They are countries that are worthy of being seen.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What will happen in
                            the Sahara?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I would want to see if
                            you could give your consideration to proposing a solution, because it is
                            important.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What solution?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: There is only one kind
                            of solution. It is a problem of principle. There could be a referendum,
                            and Algeria would accept the results of the referendum. If they want to
                            be with Morocco or with Mauritania, Algeria would have no problem. Or to
                            be independent.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can the referendum
                            take place while the Moroccans are there?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: There would have to be
                            guarantees. There can’t be a referendum under a bayonet. They could have
                            done it under the Spanish, because they were leaving.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Mauritanians are
                            there too. Did they split it half and half?</p>
                        <pb n="299" facs="0326" xml:id="pg_299"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Maybe half and half,
                            but there are many aspects of the problem. Fishing. There is the
                            political problem and the economic problem and the sovereignty
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>It is absolutely excluded that Morocco follows neither the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> or the UNO. The Ivory Coast can’t
                            judge right. One of the judges on the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> said it was a question of monarchical solidarity. He
                            told me. In The Hague.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: One of the few
                            international bodies which you don’t dominate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: It’s the same for the
                            U.S.!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I repeat, we have no
                            interest in the problem, as such.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: But you, yourself,
                            should look at it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Because you work with
                            great subtlety. I have to tell you frankly—perhaps it was not by
                            you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It was done by
                            you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Your position was one
                            of principle, it was very clear. Your press—<hi rend="italic"
                                >Newsweek,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>—were very
                            objective on the problem. And we find that the U.S. could have stopped
                            the Green March. The U.S. could have stopped it, or favored it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s not true.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: We think on the
                            contrary that France played a crude role. There was no delicacy, no
                            subtlety. Bourguiba, Senghor—they tried to use what influence remained
                            for France. Bongo. No finesse, no research.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know if this corresponds to your situation. But there are
                            sentiments, and we were very affected because we thought it was an
                            anti-Algerian position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t have an
                            anti-Algerian position. The only question was how much to invest. To
                            prevent the Green March would have meant hurting our relations
                            completely with Morocco, in effect an embargo.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: You could have done
                            it. You could stop economic aid and military aid.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But that would have
                            meant ruining our relations with Morocco completely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: No. The King of
                            Morocco would not have gone to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But we don’t have that
                            much interest in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: But you have interests
                            in Spain, and in Morocco.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And in Algeria.</p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="0327" xml:id="pg_300"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: And you favored
                            one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think we
                            favored one side. We tried to stay out of it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Your role could never
                            be marginal or devoid of interest because obviously there was military
                            cooperation with Morocco, so, given that, you could not be neutral
                            between Morocco and Algeria. So I understand you had to be, or appear to
                            be, favoring Morocco, because of that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [To Sabbagh, who is
                            interpreting] But what the Foreign Minister complains about is that we
                            didn’t favor Algeria. To take his position, we would have had to reverse
                            positions completely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Maybe it would have
                            been easy to take the principle of self-determination as a starting
                            point. Now we have a neighbor which has mobile frontiers—with
                            Mauritania, with Niger, and with Algeria. Moving frontiers. After 10
                            years. We have come to accept Mauritania in the region. If Morocco
                            occupies it with a minimum of legality, it’s a significant precedent. If
                            in the region there is this precedent of broken frontiers, there is the
                            risk of conflict. It’s not too late for you to aid a path to a solution.
                            It would have to have the maximum of guarantees of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for a referendum, and Algeria would
                            accept it. Neither the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> nor the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> recognized the rights of Morocco
                            or Mauritania.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me think about
                            this and I’ll contact you through our Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>When will you send us an Ambassador to Washington?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Effectively your
                            remark is pertinent. At the beginning of the year we will designate
                            someone. I think sincerely that it is in our interest to pick someone
                            appropriate. I will solve the problem very, very rapidly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be helpful if
                            we had someone in Washington.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I want to find someone
                            of enough stature to fit into that position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He will be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: This is the way we
                            think about it, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>,
                            and we have established such a wonderful rapport based on cooperation,
                            and in the economic field we have established a tremendous cooperation
                            that we will never forget. In the political field, the Middle East, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> can have no
                            complaints.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, you have been very
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: If you had a problem
                            with Cuba or Vietnam or Cambodia, we would be very glad, discreetly. . .
                            .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our <gloss

                            relationship. But I agree we have had a very positive relationship,
                            which I have valued.</p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="0328" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I repeat and emphasize
                            we are true friends. We have nothing to hide; we don’t maneuver. Just
                            this gesture that we are here at the table as your guests indicates it.
                            You could have said, “Let’s go off into a corner somewhere.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly. Let me look
                            into the question of a referendum. Especially if it doesn’t require
                            withdrawal before a referendum.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Yes, you said provided
                            withdrawal is not a factor. But it must be also provided there are
                            enough strong guarantees that the people can decide freely. You know
                            assassinations can be rife.</p>
                        <p>We don’t want any remaining problem. Genocide.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the Sahara?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I’m completely
                            positive. It is a problem of interests. I don’t know why Mauritania
                            wants frontiers like that or why Algeria has to be frightened. It is not
                            healthy. If Morocco and Mauritania partition it, it is not politics.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have not played a
                            very active role. Because we have enough problems without taking on new
                            ones. But I will look into it and I will be in touch.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: Think about it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will think about
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I don’t think you want
                            a new state in the region.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If it had developed,
                            we would have accepted it. Guineau Bissau, Cape Verde, we have
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: There is great wealth
                            there. In 10 or 12 years, it will be the Kuwait of the region.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But we didn’t oppose
                            it. We had no particular interest.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: The equilibrium that
                            we worked for in the region, it is important that it be maintained. I
                            don’t have the feeling that in the region your interests coincide with
                            disorder.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: I was astonished to
                            see France and Tunisia working together as “Mediterranean powers.” With
                            the problems in the Middle East and Cyprus, with the problems existing
                            in Maghreb, to speak of the Mediterranean is to be optimistic.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We were basically
                            inactive. We were not doing a great deal on either side. We didn’t help
                            you, but not Morocco either.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName>: In the Middle East you
                            have seen the situation of occupation of territory, and fait accomplis,
                            and everyone speaks of negotiations. If you speak with the Mauritanians,
                            there is no reason to defy the decision of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>. There is no reason to distrust the decision of the

                            others.</p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_302"/>
                        <p>I would add this. Whatever elements favored Morocco were dis-intoxicated
                            after the decision of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>. It was a
                            kind of mystification.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me think about
                            what if anything can be done. I’ll think about it. I never like to
                            promise anything I cannot do.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Welcome.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: I thank you for receiving me, particularly because you are
                            very busy under current circumstances. I am honored to make your
                            acquaintance. His Majesty has instructed me to convey to you his
                            greetings and assurances of his friendship.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I am a great admirer of His Majesty and have profited
                            greatly from my meetings with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: His Majesty holds you in high esteem and respects your
                            efforts to maintain peace in the world. We have our normal diplomatic
                            contacts in Rabat and Washington, but given the gravity of the <pb
                                n="303" facs="0330" xml:id="pg_303"/>circumstances, His Majesty
                            asked me to deliver the following message. You know about the problem of
                            the Sahara which has evolved over the last several years. There was the
                            Green March, followed by the agreement between Spain, Morocco and
                            Mauritania which received approval in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> by a vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I want you to tell His Majesty for me that, as a student
                            of crisis management, I believe that one of the ways to assure that no
                            one can exercise pressure on you is to remove yourself far from
                            communications. His Majesty did this when he moved to Agadir. He handled
                            the Green March with great skill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: I will not fail to tell him. He also had much support. All
                            was going along normally; the Spanish withdrawal was proceeding well,
                            and the Moroccan forces were moving in. But the Algerians caused
                            difficulties through the Polisario which is only an Algerian creation.
                            The Algerians also attacked us in the press, radio; accused us of using
                            napalm, killing civilians, and spreading many other lies which were
                            totally unjustified. They organized guerrilla attacks in the Sahara and
                            even in Morocco. They shot down a Moroccan F–5 over Mauritania and
                            intervened with the regular Algerian army. Yesterday the Moroccan army
                            captured more than 100 Algerians. The situation is generalizing. We are
                            not talking now about Mauritanian territory (that is a separate issue),
                            but of the generalization of the conflict directly against Morocco and
                            His Majesty. In this situation we ask what are our means to resist. The
                            Moroccan forces are designed to protect internal security. The Algerians
                            have Soviet arms, planes, missiles, the most modern equipment and in
                            great quantities. We witness the growing encirclement of Morocco. Let me
                            make very clear that concerning the Sahara, Morocco considers the
                            agreement to be final and will accept no compromise or back-tracking.
                            Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal have formed a barrier in the past. The
                            new Algerian offensive has the character of a generalized attack against
                            all these states. The Algerian Government has no intention of accepting
                            the international decisions adopted at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. It follows the Soviet line and like many other states
                            of Africa—Mali, Guinea, Chad, Libya, Angola—is falling under Soviet
                            influence. The Soviets appear to enjoy total freedom of action in
                            Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Don’t remind me. It is too painful. You are absolutely
                            right, and I agree with you. I testified three hours on this subject
                            today before Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: I understand the problem confronting the U.S. However, the
                            role the U.S. will play is important, and we are very sensitive to the
                            problem of Angola. However, a foreign power is influencing Algeria and
                            we must react. Spain and France help us a great deal. Spain is sensitive
                            because of the Straits of Gibraltar. Senegal and Mauritania tra<pb
                                n="304" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_304"/>ditionally have been favorable
                            to us, and France is helpful. However, in the overall picture, we feel
                            the U.S. is the only country which can defend the world against this
                            menace. What can you do to assure our defense? If we are not defended
                            politically, diplomatically and militarily we will be handed over to the
                            Soviets. That, Mr. Secretary, is the message I have been asked to
                            deliver. It is not a question of months but of days or weeks. Algeria is
                            moving fast and we fear being overcome before we have sufficient means
                            to do anything about it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That is an excellent summary of the problem. I testified
                            this morning before Congress on Angola. (To Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: We should give His
                            Excellency a copy of it so he realizes I am in agreement with him and
                            not just being polite.) Speaking to you as a friend I say we are going
                            through a difficult period which will be attenuated after the coming
                            elections. We are in a period when many of our Congressmen deny the
                            reality of power but make speeches. They remind me of the sophomores I
                            had in my classes when I was a professor. But there is a reality. I had
                            a Senator today who asked me why we could not tell the Soviets that we
                            would defend Europe and Japan and forget the rest of the world. There
                            are many members of Congress who think that way. But I think the
                            situation is changing and they are beginning to feel a little guilty.
                            Over a period of time we will get the upper hand because reality is more
                            important than rhetoric. I agree with you that the United States must
                            defend the equilibrium of freedom. The United States has a great
                            interest in the independence and sovereignty of Morocco and the
                            preservation of the Monarchy with which we have many links. I think we
                            can say we did not place too many barriers in the way of Morocco in
                            respect to the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: We appreciate this and the people of Morocco know what your
                            policy has been.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The problem is what we can do concretely, and you have
                            asked me for nothing concrete. I know you want us to speed up military
                            deliveries and we will have to examine this question in all urgency. We
                            will approach this question positively. We should like to stay
                            diplomatically in closest contact with you and would appreciate it if
                            you would give us as much information as possible about developments. We
                            will do our best to discourage aggressive acts by your neighbors. We
                            want to maintain good relations with both Morocco and Algeria but will
                            not carry this to the point of encouraging aggressive acts. I may take a
                            trip to Africa in March and if so I thought I might stop in Morocco on
                            my way. But I have not yet decided definitely. I am very grateful for
                            your explanation of your country’s views. It would be helpful for all of
                            us if we could gain time because of our domestic situation. Because of
                            the long friendship between our countries we want to be forthcoming but
                            as an old friend of your country and of His Majesty, <pb n="305"
                                facs="0332" xml:id="pg_305"/>may I say that we should avoid
                            exceedingly dramatic acts. However, if it is necessary we can take
                            measures. This is just a general view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: Thank you Mr. Minister for your sentiments and those of the
                            American people toward the Moroccan cause. All that affects Morocco
                            affects Western Europe and in turn the rest of the free world. The best
                            way to assure their future is for Western Europe and the U.S. to join in
                            defending Morocco. You spoke of a Senator who asked you why you could
                            not simply defend Europe and Japan and let the rest of the world go.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The man who said that was an idiot. If the whole world
                            becomes Russian-dominated the economies of the U.S. and of all countries
                            in Western Europe will be affected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: The problem is that this is a race against the clock. I fear
                            if we wait three or four months an irreversible situation will be
                            created and we will be unable to do anything about it. The situation in
                            the Saharan area is changing quickly. I think there are other ways to
                            intervene. The fact that the Soviets and Algerians know that the U.S.
                            fleet is in the Mediterranean is a brake. However, we do not consider
                            your military aid to be in accordance with our needs. Procedures permit
                            deliveries over a long time but our needs are immediate. We request two
                            actions: (1) that you take a position of firm U.S. support for Morocco
                            and its free neighbors; (2) that you provide material aid—indirectly if
                            direct aid is not possible. You must have the means to do this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What do you have in mind?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: The U.S. has friends who have military means, a go-between
                            who could provide quick help. I have no specific country in mind but the
                            U.S. has many friends through whom you might provide aid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: You are thinking of European countries?</p>
                        <p>Amb. Boutaleb: We receive aid from Spain and France but a demonstration
                            of U.S. support is important.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That I understand. I will think up ways to demonstrate our
                            diplomatic interest and our national interest toward Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: Morocco understands that there is no socialist camp and no
                            imperialist camp. There is only the free world versus the communist
                            world which is not free. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"

                            friends in the free world, such as the U.S. Your diplomatic and
                            political friendship already is evident but now material support is
                            needed. I apologize for being so direct but it is my desire to explain
                            our feelings which leads me to speak frankly.</p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_306"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: I appreciate your frankness and will reflect on our
                            conversation. I will be in touch with His Majesty and give him my views.
                            We will not be indifferent to Morocco’s needs. Let me think over the
                            various possibilities and be in touch with you in a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: I should hope that the visit of Your Excellency would take
                            place as soon as possible. We have need of a <hi rend="italic">coup de
                                main</hi> right away.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I must do it in the context of my African visit in the
                            second half of March.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: Time is against us. If the trip could be made as a special
                            trip it would focus attention on the Moroccan case and help us from
                            becoming another Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This we will not permit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: This will reassure the Moroccan people. It is not the same
                            situation as Angola where there is an internal struggle. In Morocco all
                            are united behind the King and they are defending the liberty of their
                            country against an outside threat.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Let me look at my schedule. If I go to Europe for some
                            reason it would be easier to visit Morocco from there. Moroccan
                            hospitality has been so overwhelming that I would not need much
                            encouragement. The problem is that I gain too much weight when I go to
                            Morocco. (To <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>) Remember
                            the luncheon His Majesty arranged for us during Ramadan when he could
                            not eat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: It is unprecedented in Islam to eat during this period. It
                            shows we are much less bound by traditions than the other Arab
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: His Majesty arranged this for me but he was not present
                            during the meal while we ate. His Majesty on another occasion received
                            me at the Palace and I enjoyed a Moroccan meal which we ate with our
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: We are a peaceful country—we seek to live in independence
                            and peace.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I appreciate your visit very much. We will be in touch.
                            Will you please give my warm and friendly regards to His Majesty and say
                            that I shall count on seeing him soon, and that he will have our
                            sympathetic support.</p>
                        <p>Are we announcing this visit? (Mr. Lamrani’s)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lamrani: It is a confidential visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But it is on my calendar and we will be asked questions.
                            Let’s announce tomorrow at the press briefing that His Majesty sent a
                            special emissary to discuss the Sahara situation. We will seize the
                            occasion to speak of our traditional and close friendship with
                            Morocco.</p>

                        <p>1. Begin summary: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NRG_1"
                                >Neumann</persName> and I met March 1 at Royal Palace in Fez for two
                            and a half hours with King Hassan. Meeting began with working dinner at
                            10 p.m., at which half dozen of Hassan’s close advisors were present,
                            and continued after coffee with Hassan alone on Moroccan side, at which
                            time I made detailed presentation to him on Middle East and Sahara,
                            following approved talking points.</p>
                        <p>2. On Middle East, Hassan expressed satisfaction that we believe there
                            must be progress in 1976 and understanding of our position on <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, but said it is important that our
                            policy show results soon. Hassan was laudatory of King Hussein and urged
                            us to encourage him in his rapprochement with Syria.</p>
                        <p>3. On Sahara, Hassan reflected determination to pursue his current
                            policies and clearly takes satisfaction in success so far achieved. He
                            is also clearly worried, however, about longer run, saying that events
                            have escalated to a dangerous degree. His mistake, he said, was that he
                            had everything worked out logically but made one basic mistake; he
                            forgot that Morocco was in Africa where things do not go according to
                            logic. Hassan said he will not accept prolonged guerrilla war of
                            attrition and, if pressed, will attack Polisario bases on Algerian
                            territory which is where Democratic Republic of the Sahara exists. It
                            seems clear, however, that his immediate objective is to consolidate
                            diplomatic support and prevent coalescence of support around Algeria,
                            especially in Third World. He is encouraged by Soviet assurances that
                            they want to avoid confrontation in North Africa and urged that <gloss

                                xml:id="pg_308"/>viets in effort to get them to persuade their
                            friends in Asia, Africa and Latin America to cool down their support of
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>4. Hassan expressed appreciation for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            support and showed understanding of why we want to avoid direct
                            involvement in Sahara dispute. At same time he urged <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> not to miss opportunity to help
                            indirectly to bring about resolution of Sahara crisis which would enable
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to establish strong strategic
                            position based on Morocco at time when future of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> position in Spain and Portugal is, in his view,
                            problematical. In response to question as to whether he had any further
                            ideas about “elegant political solution” which he had said in October he
                            would seek, Hassan said he would continue to search for peaceful
                            solution that would enable <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> to save face as long as it did not bring into
                            question Moroccanization of Sahara. He would not close the door to any
                            dialogue, would not appear as an aggressor, and would do nothing to
                            embarrass the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Overall impression of Hassan at this stage is that he feels himself in
                            position of strength politically and militarily and is generally pleased
                            with how he has manipulated matters. As he looks further down the road,
                            however, he does not see how to bring situation to a solution with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, whom he
                            profoundly distrusts and admits he does not fully understand. As result,
                            he seems less confident about his ability to maintain his gains
                            domestically and internationally in the long term. End summary.</p>
                        <p>6. During working dinner with advisors present, Hassan summarized his
                            assessment of Sahara situation along following lines. New Sahara
                            Republic will be recognized by a few countries, even though it has no
                            territory, and then countries such as North Vietnam and North Korea will
                            help it militarily. He has evidence, he said, that U.S. M–16 rifles
                            procurred from Vietnamese are being shipped to Algeria by North Korea.
                            Heavy weapons will begin to appear in the Sahara and, rather than
                            permitting his military to be killed through war of attrition, he will
                            move against Sahraoui bases of supply in Algeria which would lead to
                            war.</p>
                        <p>7. Asked if he thought such an evolution of events was inevitable, Hassan
                            replied in the negative. He believes Algerians made an irreversible
                            tactical mistake by shifting question at <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> from one of recognition of a liberation movement to one
                            of recognition of a new state, and that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> now recognizes this and is nervous. In
                            international arena, he urged that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            can play an important role, “not in Africa but at the Summit.” Kosygin
                            had told Prime Minister Osman that Soviets do not want confrontation in
                            North Africa and believe that the issue should be settled politically.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could help by persuading Moscow
                            to convince its friends in the Third World to cool down their support
                            for <pb n="309" facs="0336" xml:id="pg_309"/>Algeria. (Hassan indicated
                            at this point that he would soon restore relations with East
                            Germany.)</p>
                        <p>8. In an interesting if unsubstantiated diversion, Hassan developed
                            interesting thesis that Polisario was not created by Algeria but by
                            leftist Spanish officers seeking a base from which to move against
                            Franco’s regime in Spain. He accused Algerians of exerting pressure on
                            Spain, inter alia by offering to be host to Spanish opposition groups
                            now living abroad. With respect to Spain, Hassan expressed unhappiness
                            with present Spanish position on legality of Moroccan/Mauritanian
                            takeover and said that Spanish should remember that tripartite agreement
                            also includes annexes giving economic advantages to Spain; if Spain does
                            not abide by tripartite agreement, Morocco will not abide by these
                            annexes.</p>
                        <p>9. After dinner, Hassan dismissed his advisors and asked me to convey to
                            him my instructions from the Secretary. I said that the Secretary had
                            sent me on this trip because situations are developing in the Middle
                            East and North Africa which will be important to both Morocco and the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. The Secretary had asked me to
                            review all matters of common interest with His Majesty in accordance
                            with our practice of periodic consultations. Hassan indicated he would
                            prefer to review Middle East situation first, and I therefore made
                            detailed presentation of our present assessment and efforts along
                            standard lines. At the end I expressed our appreciation for Hassan’s
                            understanding attitude toward our Middle East peace efforts, said that
                            the Secretary had always appreciated His Majesty’s views and advise and
                            offered to convey his comments back to Washington. In brief response,
                            Hassan expressed satisfaction that we agreed that there should be
                            progress in 1976. Re our strategy toward <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss>, he said this would pay dividends in the long run but
                            contains dangers in the short run. He urged that we show results soon.
                            Finally, he said he thought we should encourage King Hussein to continue
                            playing his peace role and should “push him towards President Asad.” He
                            expressed admiration for Hussein and believed that Hussein’s influence
                            could be useful. He also foresaw growing differences between Syrians and
                            Palestinians.</p>
                        <p>10. I concluded this portion of the discussion by emphasizing it was
                            important for success of our efforts that voices of moderation continue
                            to prevail in Arab world; militant steps or actions taken out of
                            frustration, such as move to expel Israel from <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, could reverse favorable trend of recent years. I also
                            stressed need for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> to follow
                            Egyptian and Syrian lead in accepting that final peace settlement must
                            include recognition of existence of Israel. Hassan’s response was that
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> would act more responsibly if
                            they had more responsibility.</p>
                        <p>11. Turning to the Sahara question, I said that the results of various
                            efforts to mediate the dispute have been disappointing. We fear that if
                                <pb n="310" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_310"/>Algeria and Morocco fail to
                            reconcile their differences, this will create regional instability which
                            in turn could be exploited by the Soviets, Cubans or other outside
                            elements to serve their own interests.</p>
                        <p>12. I said I had not come in the role of mediator or to press any
                            particular solution or approach. The United States does not believe it
                            would be helpful for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to become
                            involved in the substance of any negotiations among the concerned and
                            interested parties. We believe this problem should be settled on a
                            regional basis or within the context of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>, and we shall continue to lend our support to such
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>13. I said I had come, after a stop in Tunisia, from Algeria, where I
                            joined with Under Secretary Robinson in talks with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> on a range of economic and
                            political issues. The Algerians, in Algiers and Washington, have
                            conveyed to us (as they have to many other countries and to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General Waldheim) their
                            well-known position. In my talk with <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>, I explained the rationale for the policy we
                            have followed. I pointed out the risk to Algerian interests of pursuing
                            a militant course or of any steps to internationalize the dispute. I
                            also made clear that we want friendly relations with Algeria, but not at
                            the expense of our old friendship with His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>14. We were heartened, I said, by Hassan’s and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s declarations that neither
                            of their countries will deliberately initiate hostilities over the
                            Sahara question. However, so long as the military buildup continues on
                            both sides and so long as guerrilla warfare persists, there is a real
                            danger that an unplanned incident could touch off generalized
                            hostilities. Such a conflict would cause great suffering for the peoples
                            of the area and would divert precious resources from the respective
                            country’s development needs.</p>
                        <p>15. A prolonged confrontation, encompassing guerrilla activities and
                            countermeasures, subversion tactics and the injection of outside
                            elements could have equally injurious human and economic consequences
                            and could undermine the existing balance of power in North Africa.</p>
                        <p>16. We know from Mr. Karim Lamrani’s recent conversation with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, I continued, that
                            Hassan is fully aware of the strategic implications of this situation.
                            Of particular concern is the possibility that Algeria, frustrated in its
                            policy, may internationalize the problem by turning to the Soviet Union,
                            Cuba or North Vietnam for moral and material assistance.</p>
                        <p>17. We would also view with gravity any signs that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was thinking of abandoning
                            his tacit support for a negotiated Mid East settlement and of moving
                            into the radical Arab camp as a response to what he probably considers
                            to be a political defeat in the Sahara. The growing rapprochement
                            between Algeria and Libya is one disturbing indication of this.</p>
                        <pb n="311" facs="0338" xml:id="pg_311"/>
                        <p>18. I continued that, if this problem is not settled by negotiation in a
                            manner which is at least partially responsive to the sensitivities of
                            all concerned and interested parties, we fear events will move in the
                            direction I had just described.</p>
                        <p>19. The principle of self-determination has wide popular appeal and
                            Algeria will surely exploit this factor to the utmost. <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> public attention is beginning to focus
                            on this aspect of the Sahara problem judging from recent inquiries
                            received by the Congress and State Department.</p>
                        <p>20. As Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had
                            indicated to Mr. Lamrani, we want to be helpful to Morocco, and we are
                            sympathetic to Hassan’s problem in the Sahara. We are making every
                            effort to provide Morocco with the arms it feels it needs and to
                            facilitate the transfer of arms from other countries. It is important if
                            tension increases that Morocco be portrayed in our Congress as the
                            victim of aggression rather than failing to carry out the spirit and
                            intent of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> Resolution on the
                            Sahara for which we voted.</p>
                        <p>21. For these reasons. I said I would appreciate anything His Majesty
                            could tell me about his thoughts on how to proceed diplomatically to
                            reduce the present tensions. I noted that His Majesty said when I saw
                            him in October that efforts would be made to find an “elegant solution”
                            on the political side which would make the outcome acceptable to Spain.
                            Is there anything specific he has in mind beyond the steps already
                            taken?</p>
                        <p>22. Hassan said we could be assured that Morocco will never be an
                            embarrassing friend for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> but asks
                            that we help indirectly. He believes that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries will support him. Noting that at present
                            Tunisia provides the only ports in Southern Mediterranean where <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can resupply nuclear submarines,
                            whereas Soviets have entire Algerian and Libyan seacoasts, he said that
                            never before had Moroccan public opinion been as responsive as it is
                            today to the idea of taking sides. As a result he can now accept <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> nuclear powered ships at Moroccan ports,
                            which would have been impossible 8 months ago. Hassan said he did not
                            know which way Spain and Portugal would go but he knew where Morocco was
                            going. Saying that he was weighing his words carefully, Hassan said that
                            if Moroccans knew that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could solve
                            the Sahara problem, they would send delegations to Washington asking for
                            an alliance. This was an opportunity <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> should not miss. He was only asking <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to act consistent with our support for
                            pro-Moroccan resolution in <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> in
                            December. Hassan emphasized that he would “spurn no offer to make peace”
                            “I will not close the door on any dialogue—I will help <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to save face because this is

                        <p>23. Toward end of conversation Hassan said again that he would cause
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> no embarrassment. “I will commit
                            no aggression, but when I have had enough I will do everything to assure
                            that I am attacked.” In conclusion, I told Hassan this had been a useful
                            exchange of views. I would convey this comments to the Secretary and
                            leave with him the question I had asked earlier: Does he have anything
                            further in mind so far as an “elegant solution” is concerned. Hassan
                            said “I have no choice except to find an elegant solution, that is my
                            job, that is what the state pays me to do.” As he was seeing me out,
                            Hassan expressed warm thanks for our efforts to ensure speedy transfer
                            of military equipment from Jordan and Iran.</p>

                            Ambs <persName corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> and <persName

                            Consultations.</p>
                        <p>1. We have had very useful exchange of views on questions of mutual
                            interest, and have following observations and agreed conclusions on
                            Sahara problem which you and others such as <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Hal Saunders</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LSW_1">Sam

                                Habib</persName> may find of interest.</p>
                        <p>2. Nature of conflict—(A) Both sides seem prepared to maintain and
                            tolerate present level of violence in Sahara. It is hurting Moroccans
                            more than Algerians, in terms of lives and money, but appears to be well
                            within current Moroccan capabilities. For their part, Algerians are
                            fighting war by proxy, and can, from strictly military and financial
                            standpoint, probably keep it up indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>(B) We judge neither side is currently interested in escalating to open
                            military conflict by conventional forces. Frustration of Moroccan
                            military at continuing casualties from Polisario operations may
                            eventually lead to reprisal raids, particularly in event scope of such
                            operations widened. In any case, neither side is ready to take on the
                            other in full scale war. Moroccans may opt for more mobile tactics and
                            could eventually decide to send infiltrators into Algerian territory,
                            but fighting will remain essentially guerrilla warfare. Such a move
                            would almost certainly not occur until after <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> debate at earliest and would depend on Moroccan
                            perception of danger that it might reverse currently successful trend
                            towards denying Polisario progress on political front.</p>
                        <p>3. Possibilities of settlement—(A) We see no current settlement.
                            Essential pre-condition of willingness by either side to compromise is
                            not present. Nor does either side have power to impose settlement on
                            other.</p>
                        <p>(B) It is possible that Moroccans will eventually be able to wear down
                            Polisario, but this seems unlikely in short run and we expect
                            political-military stalemate to continue unless there is some new
                            development. Lack of international acceptance of Polisario over long
                            term might eventually force change in <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s current policy, which does not enjoy great
                            popular support in Algeria and which has caused <pb n="314" facs="0341"
                                xml:id="pg_314"/>a regrettable diversion of resources from economic
                            and social development. Such a change, however, would be unlikely in the
                            immediate or mid term.</p>
                        <p>(C) While it is difficult for us to judge chances of success, most
                            effective way to stop fighting would be to eliminate Polisario manpower
                            base. Given mobility and dispersion of Polisario forces, we do not
                            believe this would be practicable by military means. A major offensive
                            against Polisario’s principal bases on Algerian side of border would
                            probably have few results other than provoking a major Algerian
                            response, which the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> does not
                            consider it could successfully counter.</p>
                        <p>(D) More promising tactic would be for Moroccans to persuade Sahraoui
                            refugees, who are Polisario’s population base, to return to territory
                            now controlled by Moroccans and Mauritanians. This would require major
                            propaganda and public relations effort, and sizeable expenditures of
                            funds and energy to provide Saharans with prospect of lives so much more
                            attractive than life in camps so as to make them return to their former
                            homes in defiance of Polisario leaders. If successful, such an effort
                            would change situation radically. Polisario guerrillas are mostly from
                            refugee families, and if families left area under Algerian control it
                            would mean men would accompany or follow. After dismal initial policy of
                            intimidation which was responsible in large measure (but not entirely)
                            for movement of many Saharans across border, Moroccans apparently
                            beginning to appreciate value of gentler tactics, as evidenced by their
                            efforts at Geneva with <gloss target="#t_UNHCR_1">UNHCR</gloss> and new
                            radio program beamed at refugees, urging them to come home. This is
                            hopeful sign and we should encourage Moroccans to make serious try to
                            win hearts and minds of Sahraouis. Were latter to return home, Algerians
                            would no longer be able to exploit them so easily and issue would
                            eventually die on the vine. Indeed, a form of self-determination would
                            have been exercised.</p>

                            vote:</p>
                        <p>(I) Political-Bilateral. (A) Algeria. Our vote for pro-Moroccan
                            resolution at last <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> had chilling
                            effect on our political relations with Algeria, but those relations not
                            very warm to begin with. Principal casualty was Secretary’s dialogue
                            with <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, but since that
                            was centered on Mid-East settlement efforts which held up by Lebanese
                            crisis in any event, net damage well within tolerable limits. (B)
                            Morocco. This vote has brought a marked, positive change in relations,
                            highlighted by greatly increased intelligence coordination, cooperation
                            on terrorism, <gloss target="#t_NPW_1">NPW</gloss> visits, decisions to
                            move on double taxation treaty, active policy of encouraging private
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> investments, and support for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> positions on Korea and Puerto
                            Rico.</p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="0342" xml:id="pg_315"/>
                        <p>(II) Political-Multilateral. In multilateral fora Algerian performance
                            since last December has, if anything, been more moderate than it was
                            before. This may have been result in large part of coincidental factors
                            such as changing political realities of Third World, but also reflected
                            to some extent the representations we have made to them on subjects of
                            mutual interest. Algerians have not rejected our positions out of hand
                            in spite of their unhappiness over our position on Sahara. (They may
                            hope, however, that their relative moderation will have a payoff in
                            terms of more sympathy for their Saharan policies, although they have
                            not been talking in such terms.)</p>
                        <p>(III) Economic. Economic cooperation with Algeria has continued at a high
                            level of activity, with some $2 billion worth of contracts being signed
                            in the past six months. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> apparently is not going to let his political
                            displeasure interfere with his essentially pragmatic economic
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>(B) The 1976 <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> Session. We assume
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> will be repeat of Colombo,
                            i.e. that Algerians will not be able to garner a great deal of support
                            for their position, and that there will be agreement by majority of
                                <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> members to buck question back
                            to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. We think this approach should
                            be encouraged, but believe <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should
                            maintain low profile. We assume <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            will continue to support Madrid Agreement if question comes up, but do
                            not believe we should be in forefront or engage in any impassioned
                            defense of it. To state the obvious, we agree that we should remain
                            consistent with our position at last year’s <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>. To do otherwise would probably have little bearing on
                            our basic, longterm political and economic relations with Algeria, but
                            would cause a serious estrangement in our currently positive relations
                            with Morocco and raise serious questions about our reliability on the
                            part of such Moroccan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> friends as
                            Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Senegal, to name a few.</p>
                        <p>5. Soviet Policy on the Sahara—As we see it, Soviet policy continues to
                            be one of public neutrality on what Moscow considers a regional dispute
                            best left to solution among Arab and possibly African nations without
                            superpower involvement. While Soviets will continue to support Algeria
                            militarily because of latter’s usefulness as a cooperative, prominent
                            Third-World leader in international fora, we do not think Soviets are
                            interested in provoking a conflict, and would expect them to exercise
                            restraint in arms supply relationship. This being said, there is the
                            possibility, alluded to by Algiers in earlier messages, that the
                            Algerians, driven to despair in a military contest which the Moroccans
                            seemed to be winning, might decide to cede to the Soviets the use of
                            naval or air facilities in exchange for all-out support. Were the
                            Soviets to accept such a trade, it would lead to an immediate and
                            dangerous polarization of the conflict, as well as affecting directly
                            our in<pb n="316" facs="0343" xml:id="pg_316"/>terests in the
                            Mediterranean. We judge that the likelihood of this happening is remote,
                            for two reasons. First, we do not visualize the military conflict taking
                            such a path. The two parties are too evenly matched when one considers
                            not only hardware, where the Algerians apparently are currently
                            superior, but the ability to use it. Secondly, the Soviets evidently
                            attach importance to their relations with Morocco because of naval
                            visits in Morocco’s Atlantic ports, lucrative fishing potential in
                            Moroccan and Saharan waters, and ever-present hope for longterm, assured
                            supply of Moroccan phosphates. We do not believe they would wish to
                            jeopardize totally their relations with Morocco in return for, say,
                            limited access to Algerian ports which would be convenient but not vital
                            to continued Soviet naval presence in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>6. Impact on the Middle East Peace Efforts. It is conceivable that
                            frustrations over Sahara could lead <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> to join Rejectionist Front and actively to
                            oppose our Middle East settlement efforts. There are inherent and
                            essentially Arab inhibitions against his doing so, however, it would,
                            for instance, alienate the Egyptians and the Saudis. It would also
                            involve a degree of cooperation with Iraq which seems unlikely given
                            current Algerian unhappiness with that country’s position on the
                            Lebanese crisis. The current disarray among the Palestinians, and the
                            Algerian commitment to the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> are
                            other factors against such a move. For these, if for no other reasons,
                            we suspect that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> will
                            continue his essentially neutral (and inexpensive) stance of saying he
                            will accept whatever the Palestinians and confrontation states will
                            accept and will not try to sabotage another <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> effort in the <gloss target="#t_ME_1">ME</gloss>. We
                            assume we could live with that. In the unlikely event, however, that the
                            Saharan conflict were to escalate to a point at which he needed access
                            to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s arms stockpiles and
                            if <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> then demanded as the
                            price of admission his adherence to the Rejectionist Front, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> would probably go along.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> Caveat—Although I agree
                            with above and see no workable alternative in short run to essentially
                            pro-Moroccan stance implicit therein, I am concerned by the long-term
                            implications of our arms supply relationship with Morocco. While that
                            relationship was originally established before Sahara went critical,
                            latter problem has apparently generated sizeable increase in Moroccan
                            requests for equipment from the U.S. and other sources. These requests
                            would of course be more modest if relations with Algeria were not
                            strained over the Sahara, andizgwkmy [<hi rend="italic">and
                                especially</hi>?] the Algerians, who apparently receive important
                            military help from the Soviets and to lesser extent from Libya. Be that
                            as it may, we seem now to be operating on thesis that we, along with
                            French and other Western Europeans, must arm Moroccans so they can
                            defend selves against Algerians, although we have no con<pb n="317"
                                facs="0344" xml:id="pg_317"/>trol over Moroccan actions which may
                            precipitate hostilities—the Green March being a case in point. You will
                            recall the process by which we suddenly found ourselves the major
                            supplier of arms to Israel. It seems to me that there are disturbing
                            parallels with that situation, and that we risk finding ourselves in a
                            similar relationship with Morocco. Perhaps we have no alternative, but
                            before continuing along this path, we should stop and reconsider very
                            carefully what we are doing.</p>
                        <p>8. Bob shares my concern to this extent, if the U.S. were to replace
                            France as the number one military supplier, it could result in a
                            client-state relationship disproportionate to our interests in Morocco
                            and a relationship with a potential of involving us far too deeply in
                            situations, over which, as I have noted, we might not have control. If,
                            however, France remains the predominant Western power in, and the major
                            supplier of military equipment to Morocco, and the U.S. continues, as he
                            believes to be the case, to respond to Moroccan military requests in
                            measured terms without opening the floodgates, he is not as concerned as
                            I am.</p>

                        <p>The Sahara continues to be the focus of deep-seated antagonism between
                            Morocco and Algeria. While the two countries have avoided a direct
                            military conflict, the struggle for the Western Sahara has been waged on
                            three fronts:</p>
                        <p>—Polisario guerrillas and Moroccan regular units have engaged in a
                            moderate level of military hostilities.</p>
                        <p>—A fierce diplomatic competition has been waged in international
                            forums.</p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="0346" xml:id="pg_319"/>
                        <p>—Morocco and Mauritania have made steady progress to consolidate their
                            administrative hold on the area.</p>
                        <p>Despite this activity, there will probably not be any major changes in
                            the Saharan situation over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>—The Polisario Front will continue its hit-and-run raids, but probably at
                            a modest level that will not cause Morocco to launch a major strike into
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—Morocco and Mauritania will continue to control the main population
                            centers and to administer their respective areas of the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Neither Morocco nor Algeria shows any willingness to make the
                            compromises needed for a settlement, but neither will try to widen the
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>—Algeria will seek to keep the issue of self-determination alive in
                            international forums, but the widespread perception in the Third World
                            that Moroccan/Mauritanian control is an accomplished fact will continue
                            to limit support for Algeria’s position largely to a number of radical
                            and Communist states.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets, seeking to preserve their presence in Morocco, will remain
                            publicly neutral, despite their closer ties to Algeria.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Developments Within the Sahara</p>
                        <p>Morocco and Mauritania have made considerable progress during the last
                            eight months in dividing up the Sahara. On April 14, in an attempt to
                            establish formal sovereignty over the Western Sahara, Rabat and
                            Nouakchott announced that they had agreed to partition the disputed
                            territory: Morocco acquired the northern two-thirds of the Sahara,
                            containing the capital of El Aaiun and the rich phosphate deposits at Bu
                            Craa; Mauritania got the southern third, including rich marine
                            resources, the unexploited iron ore at Agracha, and the port of Dakhla,
                            whose harbor has an excellent potential (see map).</p>

                            effort to integrate the northern Sahara into the Moroccan “motherland,”
                            Rabat has sent personnel from several government ministries to work in
                            the three newly acquired provinces:</p>
                        <p>—Moroccan civilian governors and lesser functionaries are now serving in
                            the provincial capitals of El Aaiun, Semara, and Boujador, while <hi

                            assigned to smaller cities and towns.</p>
                        <p>—The Ministry of Agriculture has established three regional offices and
                            staffed them with technical personnel.</p>
                        <p>—Postal, telephone, and air links have been established.</p>
                        <p>In addition, King Hassan’s government launched a bond drive during the
                            summer to raise $230 million for development projects in the Saharan
                            provinces over the next two years. Priority will be given to mineral
                            development, tourism, and infrastructure projects.</p>
                        <p>On November 12, Rabat attempted to consolidate popular support by
                            allowing the Saharans to vote in nationwide local elections.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Hassan’s Army Under Attack</hi>. The Moroccans have had
                            only limited success in establishing military security in the northern
                            Sahara. Aside from a few large-scale sweeping operations of marginal
                            effectiveness, Moroccan forces have concentrated on maintaining control
                            of the principal population centers and the major oases. As a result of
                            this tactic, Polisario guerrillas have been able to mine roads and carry
                            out numerous small ambushes and mortar attacks in both the northern
                            Sahara and southern Morocco. The guerrillas are now able to move about
                            far more freely than was the case a few months ago.</p>
                        <p>Polisario hit-and-run operations have killed 700–800 Moroccan soldiers
                            since November 1975 and have wounded several times that number. Morale
                            among the units in the Sahara varies according to location. Many
                            Moroccan soldiers assigned to remote outposts do not like <pb n="321"
                                facs="0348" xml:id="pg_321"/>the length of time they are required to
                            stay, the lateness of pay, bad food, and lack of water. In more
                            inhabited areas, on the other hand, morale among regular units is fairly
                            good because most of the casualties have been suffered by auxiliary
                            troops and irregulars. The major complaint among Moroccan troops
                            throughout the northern Sahara and southern Morocco centers on their
                            inability to strike back at Polisario safe havens inside Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Morocco probably will be able to live with the present, or even a
                            somewhat higher, level of casualties for an extended period without
                            feeling the necessity to attack Algeria. The Moroccans are fully
                            convinced of the justness of their claims to the Sahara, and army units
                            generally are willing to pay a heavy price to maintain control of this
                            area. To boost morale, the government has sent a large number of
                            replacements to the southern zone to permit troop rotation. In addition,
                            the Moroccans, in an attempt to improve their military security in the
                            northern Sahara, have begun recently to abandon their strategy of
                            stationing large numbers of troops in a few key places. Moroccan forces
                            are now concentrating, with some success, on the use of smaller, more
                            mobile units transported by French-supplied helicopters to seek out and
                            destroy roving Polisario guerrillas.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mauritania Asserts Control</hi>. Mauritania has
                            encountered relatively little opposition in absorbing its portion of the
                            Sahara. Like Rabat, Nouakchott has supplied administrative personnel to
                            fill the vacuum left by the departing Spanish. When presidential and
                            parliamentary elections were held in August, the electoral process
                            extended to the Mauritanian-controlled portion of the Sahara. Eight
                            Saharan representatives now hold seats in the National Assembly. The
                            Ould Daddah regime views the elections as an expression of approval by
                            the Saharan people of Mauritanian annexation.</p>
                        <p>The large, sparsely populated, and weakly defended Mauritanian homeland
                            has experienced occasional attacks by Polisario bands, notably the
                            deep-penetration strike against Nouakchott in June. On the other hand,
                            the Polisario has attempted very few operations in the southern Sahara
                            because of the following factors:</p>
                        <p>—The Mauritanian Sahara is more than 500 miles from Polisario base camps
                            in southwestern Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—The southern Saharans, who have close ethnic and linguistic ties with
                            the Mauritanians, had little difficulty accommodating themselves to
                            their new rulers.</p>
                        <p>—Unlike the Moroccans, the Mauritanian Army did not alienate the local
                            population by heavy use of force when it occupied the territory.</p>
                        <p>Mauritanian administration of the southern Sahara was aided by Moroccan
                            technical personnel who maintained and operated such fa<pb n="322"
                                facs="0349" xml:id="pg_322"/>cilities as electric generator plants
                            and airport control towers. At present, Moroccan military personnel are
                            stationed in Bir Moghrein to provide armor and artillery support. Some
                            Moroccans also serve as liaison officers with Mauritanian General
                            Headquarters in Nouakchott, and a small number of Mauritanian soldiers
                            are receiving training in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Despite frictions at the working level and residual suspicion that the
                            Moroccans intend eventually to absorb all of Mauritania, Nouakchott has
                            become closely allied to Rabat. With the southern Sahara fully absorbed,
                            Mauritania is far less likely now than it was a year ago to drop its
                            policy coordination with Morocco in favor of a separate deal with the
                            Polisario or Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Prospects for continued Mauritanian solidarity with Morocco look good
                            over the next <hi rend="italic">six months</hi>. Over the following year
                            or two, however, if Polisario operations become focused against the
                            Moroccans and Mauritania is left alone, [*At present, this scenario
                            seems unlikely. It is more likely that the Algerians will continue to
                            consider Mauritania as the weak link in the Saharan problem and will
                            persist in exerting military pressure on the Ould Daddah regime (as
                            exemplified by the raid against Nouakchott last June).] the Ould Daddah
                            regime may be willing to accept an accommodation with the Polisario
                            leadership and Algiers. Such a development would greatly weaken Hassan’s
                            military and political position: it would facilitate the Polisario’s
                            military access to the Sahara and undermine much of the political
                            support of a number of African and other states for partition of the
                            Sahara. Within Mauritania such a move would mollify a significant and
                            disgruntled portion of the younger generation. These persons have openly
                            questioned their government’s decision not to agree to the establishment
                            of an independent Saharan state instead of dividing the Sahara with
                            Morocco, an act that has brought about a military confrontation between
                            Nouakchott and the Polisario.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Polisario Keeps on Punching</hi>. Polisario units
                            have operated during the last eight months out of safe havens in
                            neighboring Algeria, which has long borders with Morocco and Mauritania.
                            The Polisario guerrillas continue to receive ample supplies and
                            equipment from Algeria. Much of this support is of Soviet origin, and
                            some of the weapons come from Libya. With 25,000–40,000 politicized and
                            frustrated Saharans living in refugee camps in the Tindouf area of
                            southwestern Algeria, the Polisario Front has a good source of manpower
                            for its fighting forces.</p>
                        <p>By employing Land Rovers and hit-and-run tactics, small bands of
                            guerrillas have been able to operate almost daily against elements of
                            the 30,000 Moroccan troops in the northern Sahara and southern Morocco.
                            While lacking sophisticated logistics and communications, the <pb
                                n="323" facs="0350" xml:id="pg_323"/>guerrillas benefit from
                            excellent local intelligence sources and high morale. The Polisario
                            insurgents, numbering at least 2,000–3,000 combatants, in addition to
                            support personnel, appear to be well equipped with small arms,
                            ammunition, and vehicles of all makes, and they are confident of their
                            ability to move about unchallenged by the entrenched Moroccan forces.
                            Guerrilla operations against Moroccan forces during the past few months
                            suggest that the Polisario military capability may be improving.</p>
                        <p>Polisario guerrillas have been able to strike at and keep immobilized the
                            line-conveyor belt complex used to transport phosphates from Bu Craa to
                            the port at El Aaiun. Similarly, the lack of security in the northern
                            Sahara seriously hindered Moroccan attempts in September–October 1976 to
                            use trucks as a substitute for the transporter belt. Nevertheless,
                            because of the excess capacity of Moroccan phosphate mines and the
                            current reduced world demand for phosphate, the crippling of the Bu Craa
                            operation has not hurt the Moroccans economically.</p>
                        <p>Despite their ability to operate against Moroccan targets, the guerrillas
                            still do not control any significant portion of Saharan territory. Nor
                            has Polisario military action by itself accomplished political ends. The

                        <p>The potential for a settlement has scarcely improved during the past
                            year. Neither Morocco nor Algeria has yet shown a willingness to back
                            away from its basic position. While there are some indications that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> has become more
                            interested in a face-saving way out of the Sahara problem, he most
                            probably will still insist on some form of self-determination—which the
                            Moroccans and Mauritanians oppose. Although <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s approach to the Sahara issue does not enjoy
                            widespread support in Algeria, where many think it is an unnecessary
                            diversion of Algerian resources, his personal commitment, both public
                                <pb n="326" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_326"/>and ideological, is likely
                            to preclude abandonment of the Polisario cause. At the same time,
                            however, widespread dissatisfaction with the regime’s handling of the
                            Sahara problem, extending in some cases to the top level of the
                            government, means that an Algerian reversal on this issue cannot be
                            excluded.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of a settlement, it is unlikely that there will be major
                            hostilities between Algeria and Morocco during the next several months.
                            Algeria is unlikely to take the initiative.</p>
                        <p>—The Algerian Armed Forces are not prepared to launch a major attack. The
                            army, which has been used primarily in civic action programs for many
                            years, will require considerable time to assimilate newly acquired
                            Soviet weaponry.</p>
                        <p>—The leadership is preoccupied with national assembly elections aimed at
                            legitimizing the regime.</p>
                        <p>—An unpopular war with Morocco could create problems for <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s strategy, therefore,
                            probably is to wait for the Moroccans to attack, in order to brand them
                            as the aggressors in international forums. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> greatly prefers to fight a war by proxy
                            through the Polisario Front. The Algerians can probably sustain such a
                            war for a considerable time to come.</p>
                        <p>Morocco, for its part, is also unlikely to initiate major
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>—The Moroccan military establishment, emasculated by Hassan following
                            coup attempts in 1970 and 1971, is still in the process of rebuilding
                            itself and assimilating French and American weaponry. The military feels
                            that it will not be ready to fight a war with Algeria for another year
                            or two.</p>
                        <p>—Hassan realizes that a humiliating military defeat could cost him his
                            throne.</p>
                        <p>—Both the King and the army recognize that any overt military move into
                            Algeria would undercut the increasing support and understanding that
                            Morocco has laboriously gained in international forums from the more
                            moderate nations.</p>
                        <p>Although the casualties inflicted by Polisario operations continue to
                            cause considerable frustration in the Moroccan Army, we believe that
                            Hassan is more likely to respond by sending infiltrators into Algerian
                            territory than by launching a major attack. The Moroccans have been
                            training and equipping their own guerrilla units to give the Algerians
                            “a taste of their own medicine,” and some guerrilla activities by
                            Saharan soldiers led by Moroccans already may have begun.</p>

                        <p>There was some concern in early 1976 that the conflict over the Sahara
                            could become “internationalized,” that a polarization of forces could
                            occur in what is essentially a regional dispute, and that a proxy <pb

                                >USSR</gloss> might be in the offing. It is now very doubtful that
                            the dispute over the Sahara will follow this course, unless major
                            hostilities broke out between the antagonists—an unlikely possibility at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Soviet policy toward the Sahara issue continues to be one of public
                            neutrality. Moscow considers the problem a regional dispute whose
                            resolution is best left to Arab and African nations, without superpower
                            involvement. While the Soviets will continue to support Algeria
                            militarily because of its usefulness as a cooperative, prominent Third
                            World leader, it is doubtful that they are interested in fueling or
                            provoking a conflict. In addition, the desire of the Soviets to preserve
                            their presence in Morocco probably will cause them to limit their
                            involvement in support of any Algerian military operations.</p>

                        <p>The longer the Moroccans can tolerate Polisario guerrilla operations

                            their pressures on the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to take
                            sides.</p>
                        <p>The present moderate level of Polisario operations affords Hassan and
                            Ould Daddah time in which to finesse a negotiated solution of the Sahara
                            problem. One possible Moroccan tactic would be a sizable public
                            relations campaign to lure back to the Sahara a substantial number of
                            refugees in Polisario-run camps in southwest Algeria. Conditions in
                            these camps are poor, and the Moroccans have already begun to beam radio
                            broadcasts at the refugees urging them to come home. The return of most
                            of the refugees would cause the Polisario manpower problems because some
                            of the guerrillas could be expected to leave their base camps in Algeria
                            and follow their families back to the Sahara. In addition, such “voting
                            with their feet” could be construed by the Moroccans (and Mauritanians)
                            as a form of self-determination.</p>
                        <p>Luring the refugees back home, however, will not be easy for Morocco. The
                            Reguibat tribesmen, who provide the dominant military and political
                            force in the Polisario, are strongly opposed to Moroccan domination. In
                            addition to a long history of Reguibat-Moroccan hostility, the Reguibat
                            are deeply embittered over the mistreatment of tribal members during
                            Morocco’s takeover of the northern Sahara in late 1975-early 1976.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of Algeria remains crucial to prospects for an early
                            settlement. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> has shown
                            a willingness, in private, to moderate somewhat his position in recent
                            months and now appears more <pb n="328" facs="0355" xml:id="pg_328"
                            />willing to reach an accommodation with Hassan than he was a year ago.
                            At the same time, however, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> will not agree to a settlement whose terms do
                            not give him an honorable way out of the Saharan conflict. Moreover,
                            Algeria has recently reiterated a hard line in public statements on the
                            dispute, suggesting that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> does not believe that this is an appropriate
                            time to compromise.</p>
                        <p>If an accommodation over the Sahara issue is to be achieved in the next
                            six months, it will probably require assistance from outside parties,
                            possibly including financial inducements. In this regard, the Saudis
                            have been heavily engaged since mid-November in an effort to mediate the
                            dispute, including visits to the Maghreb by Crown Prince Fahd and
                            Foreign Minister Saud. There is unconfirmed reporting that Algerian
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bouteflika</persName> and
                            Moroccan Foreign Minister Laraki met secretly in Paris in early
                            December. They failed, however, to reach a preliminary agreement on the
                            Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>Optimism concerning an early solution of the problem and reports of a
                            possible <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>-Hassan
                            meeting in early 1977 appear to have been premature. <persName

                            and other recent Algerian statements have downplayed the Saudi
                            initiatives for a compromise. The depth of emotional commitment on both
                            sides, despite the high cost of continued confrontation, undermines the
                            prospects for early settlement.</p>

                        <p>(C) After the amenities, Mr. Bennour opened the conversation by saying he
                            had a message to bring. Tunisia and the U.S. have been friends for a
                            long time and Tunisia has the same views of freedom that the U.S. has;
                            however, the U.S. military assistance to Tunisia is not up to
                            expectations. Tunisia expects its defense needs over the next four years
                            to amount to $40 million. Bennour said Tunisia continued to be concerned
                            over Soviet activity in the area, and although Tunisia appreciates the
                            presence of the SIXTH FLEET, the U.S. should also be interested in
                            strengthening Tunisia’s defense capability. He said they had heard in
                            Tunisia that the U.S. might cancel grant aid next year, but hoped this
                            was not true. Tunisia used its assistance effectively and always takes
                            good care of its military equipment. Tunisia is interested in economic
                            development, but the Government is also interested in the people and
                            their social well being.</p>
                        <p>(C) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> replied by
                            reviewing U.S. appreciation for our good relations with Tunisia and the
                            hospitality afforded SIXTH FLEET visits in Tunisian ports. The U.S. also
                            appreciates the history of moderation of Tunisia in its foreign affairs.
                            Although we are aware that Tunisia utilizes its military equipment
                            effectively, the Ambassador, living in the U.S., is also aware of the
                            problems we have with Congressional atti<pb n="330" facs="0357"
                                xml:id="pg_330"/>tudes toward military assistance. This attitude
                            could be considered an emotional aftermath of Vietnam and limits the
                            flexibility of the Executive Branch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1"
                                >Noyes</persName> added that all military forces around the world
                            have problems with modernization and the rising cost of arms. In
                            response to the question on grant aid, Bennour was informed that we
                            would hope to continue some grant aid one more year, but that this was
                            subject to Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p>(C) Bennour said that what was worrying him was the attitude of the
                            leaders of his party and Government because it may appear to them that
                            the new U.S. relationship with some countries (Egypt) would be
                            accomplished at the expense of old friends like Tunisia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> replied that this new
                            relationship was designed to establish peace in the area and avoid a
                            confrontation with the Soviets, but does not change long-term policy
                            with our friends. It would also be to Tunisia’s advantage to lessen a
                            requirement for arms if peace could be effectively established in the
                            Middle-East.</p>
                        <p>(C) Referring to Libya, Mr. Bennour stated Tunisia had two theories about
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>: (i) <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s power was not weakened and
                            his concentration on ideology means subversion, especially dangerous to
                            Tunisia; and (ii) <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            position has actually been weakened and Jallud has emerged as the strong
                            man. Bennour said the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> believed the
                            first theory was more accurate.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> entered the
                            conversation by acknowledging he was well aware of the problems with
                            Congress on military assistance. He went on to say that he was pleased
                            with the cooperation developing between the U.S. and countries of the
                            Middle-East and that he was also pleased that State had placed North
                            Africa with the Middle-East Bureau rather than Africa. He concluded by
                            saying that Tunisia is against military spending, but since everybody
                            around us is investing in military equipment, we have to do what we have
                            to for our security. We are encouraged by a possible settlement in the
                            Middle-East but, “I must stress that Tunisia must not be forgotten.” Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>(C) Finally, in conclusion, Mr. Bennour stated that they were having
                            delays in spare parts and equipment and that Tunisia was now looking at
                            the possibility of buying new A–4M’s rather than rehabilitated A–4C’s.
                            (We will look into the spare parts problems.)</p>

                            enclosed Credit Justification dated May 9, 1974. This Justification has
                            been concurred in by representatives of the Departments of State,
                            Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget. The Department of the
                            Treasury believes that given the amount of credit involved and the
                            strength of the Tunisian economy that the credit term should be no more
                            than five years. Any significant changes in the purpose of the credit or
                            in the terms and conditions should be submitted for similar
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the term of repayment has been set at eight years in
                            contrast to the ten year period suggested in your memorandum. The eight
                            year period has been decided upon on the basis of available economic
                            information on Tunisia and <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign
                            policy interests vis-à-vis Tunisia and the Middle East in general.</p>

                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Does the provision of this credit support a military
                                requirement derived from a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-approved force goal?</hi></p>
                        <p>Yes. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has agreed that these
                            aircraft are necessary to replace existing, obsolete aircraft.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Are there other military justifications?</hi></p>
                        <p>This transaction will enable Tunisia to meet its legitimate security
                            needs. Neighboring countries possess sizeable military forces with
                            considerably more sophisticated aircraft than Tunisia. Tunisia’s
                            existing F–86’s are obsolete and need to be replaced. The A–4C aircraft
                            is a logical replacement, since it is modestly priced, subsonic, and
                            less sophisticated than most other jet fighters. The acquisition of
                            these aircraft</p>
                        <p><pb n="333" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_333"/>would be consistent with
                            Tunisia’s desire to maintain a modest self-defense capability.</p>

                        <p>Grant military assistance for Tunisia is being phased out at the end of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 75. Beginning in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 74, Tunisia is receiving <gloss

                                affecting the provision of this credit? How does it support <gloss

                                region</hi>?</p>
                        <p>Tunisia is a moderate Arab country which has long been favorably disposed
                            towards the United States and the West. Tunisian ports are the only ones
                            on the southern Mediterranean littoral that are open to visits by the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Sixth Fleet, and even during the
                            recent Arab-Israeli conflict the Tunisian Government maintained a
                            favorable posture towards the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.
                            Tunisia has no expansionist or aggressive policies, and is interested in
                            peace and stability in the Middle East. It is therefore in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests to continue to maintain
                            friendly relations and provide reasonable security assistance to
                            Tunisia. Provision of this credit on the terms stated above is
                            consistent with our foreign policy objectives <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>No. Tunisia is replacing one type of aircraft with another which is only
                            slightly more advanced, and will still have far less sophisticated
                            fighter aircraft than its immediate neighbors.</p>

                                assistance</hi>?</p>
                        <p>Yes. With the anticipated phasing out of grant military assistance at the
                            end of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 75, Tunisia is turning to the
                            use of credits to meet its modest security needs. Credit assistance
                            enables Tunisia to allocate its resources in a more rational manner, and
                            is best suited to its existing financial situation.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Will the provision of this credit create a repayment
                                obligation which will place an undesirable burden on the country’s

                                budgets, or otherwise interfere with development</hi>?</p>
                        <p>No. The following is a recent summary of Tunisia’s economic situation
                            based on information supplied by Embassy Tunis:</p>
                        <p>“Tunisia’s crude petroleum exports are modest when compared to other Arab
                            States and represents only 27% of total exports. Currently, Tunisia
                            produces and exports 30 million barrels of high grade crude a year and
                            imports about 7 million barrels a year of high sulphur crude (low grade)
                            for its refineries. After deducting imports from exports, net foreign
                            exchange earnings from petroleum are expected to increase from $75
                            million in 1973 to $295 million in 1974. These earnings, together with
                            increased earnings from phosphate exports, result in an improved balance
                            of payments; projections indicate a change in the current account
                            balances from a deficit of $115 million in 1973 to a surplus of $57.5
                            million in 1974.</p>
                        <p>While the current economic picture is bright some compromising factors
                            should also be noted; i.e., the boom in petroleum and phosphate prices
                            may end in 1975; import prices for fertilizer, machinery, manufactured
                            goods, and agricultural commodities will decline as Europe experiences
                            overall recession; and high unemployment continues in Tunisia.”</p>

                            somewhat in order to develop a more effective military deterrent.
                            Accordingly, additional <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> military
                            assistance is being requested. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Tunisian Government is becoming increasingly concerned with what it
                            perceives as potential threats posed by its neighbors, Libya and
                            Algeria. This was brought home to me in separate conversations I had
                            with the President’s son, Bibi, Jr., and Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> on Dec 11 and 12,
                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> raised
                            the subject during a tour d’horizon we had at his office at the Prime
                            Ministry. He stressed that he was speaking as an individual who had long
                            abhorred things military and who, as Prime Minister, had adhered to a
                            policy of concentrating Tunisian resources on economic development.
                            Expenditures on Tunisian military had traditionally been kept to an
                            absolute minimum. Now, however, the Tunisian Government is being forced
                            to re-evaluate its military situation in the light of growing threats
                            from both Libya and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>4. He said that Libyan Government is continuing to insist on unity with
                            Tunisia and that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has told
                            the press that this will be achieved in 1975 willy nilly, if necessary
                            by force. (We have seen no such statement and would appreciate Embassy
                            Tripoli’s comment.) Meanwhile, Soviet arms are flowing into Libya, as
                            well as “400 technicians.” Prime Minister alluded to current maneuvers
                            being undertaken by Tunisian military in southern Tunisia and stated
                            that when Libyan Government learned of these maneuvers it informed
                            Tunisians of names of Libyans who would be in attendance. Tunisian
                            Government <pb n="336" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_336"/>had replied that no
                            Libyans were invited to maneuvers, but that if Libyan representatives
                            wished to attend parade being staged on final day, they were
                            welcome.</p>
                        <p>5. With regard to Algeria, Prime Minister seemed to feel threat from this
                            direction was less imminent, but nevertheless he was concerned with
                            Algeria’s putative expansionist aspirations. He referred in critical
                            manner to Algerian agricultural policy and seemed to feel that recent
                            death of Algerian Minister of Interior was other than natural. He
                            dwelled less on Algeria than on Libya.</p>
                        <p>6. Prime Minister said that he wanted U.S. as “friendly country” to be
                            fully aware of growing Tunisian concern at threats posed by its two
                            neighbors. He did not rpt not wish to go into details but he hoped that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could be helpful. Tunisia did
                            not intend to build a large army, but it needed to upgrade its military
                            capability in order better to de-ter invading forces. Additional
                            equipment would be needed for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>7. In separate meeting Bibi, Jr. made somewhat similar presentation. At
                            private lunch at palace last Sunday his father had told him that he was
                            preoccupied with Libyan and Algerian threats. Re Libya, two factors in
                            particular worried the President: (1) insistence on part of Libyan
                            delegation which recently visited Tunisia that two countries unite now,
                            otherwise cooperation would be hampered; and (2) introduction of large
                            quantities of Soviet arms into Libya. Bibi, Jr. said President Bourguiba
                            is worried that a “crackpot” might use this equipment against Tunisia,
                            which has a very modest military force.</p>
                        <p>8. Bibi, Jr. observed that Tunisia’s concern is reflected in venue chosen
                            for current Tunisian military maneuvers—area near Libyan border. He
                            claimed that Libyans are building airstrips on their side of border.
                            Also rate of attempted infiltration across border has stepped up, but
                            fortunately Tunisian security forces (aided by Tunisian villagers along
                            border) are believed to have intercepted most of them.</p>
                        <p>9. Re Algeria; Bibi, Jr. indicated that his father is worried about
                            Algeria’s ambitions to dominate the whole Maghreb. Bibi, Jr.
                            characterized Algerian leadership as untrustworthy and of questionable
                            caliber. He claimed it is composed mainly of ex-fellagas. Agricultural
                            policy in Algeria is misguided and economic trends are “expansionist.”
                            (sic).</p>
                        <p>10. President had told Bibi, Jr. that in view of these twin threats,
                            Tunisia must upgrade its armed forces in order to be in position to
                            delay invading forces long enough to obtain support of international
                            community and/or the Sixth Fleet. While President acknowledged he is not
                            rpt not conversant with military equipment, he told Bibi, Jr. that he
                            thought Tunisia needed interceptor fighter-bombers and anti-tank weapons
                            “ground to ground.” Also, he considered that Tunisia needs fast speed
                            boats for purpose of intercepting infiltrators who might <pb n="337"
                                facs="0364" xml:id="pg_337"/>come by sea. Bibi, Jr. said that his
                            father is aware of mood in Congress to cut back U.S. military assistance
                            abroad, but Tunisia’s needs in this regard are crucial and urgent.</p>
                        <p>11. In response to both foregoing presentations I confirmed that
                            Congressional mood is indeed bearish toward continuation of U.S.
                            military assistance abroad and that we would be lucky if current
                            Tunisian program could be continued even at current modest level over
                            coming years. I referred to $40 million limit imposed by Congress on
                            U.S. military assistance to “African countries”, but noted that even if
                            Tunisia were removed from this category, more funds for Tunisia were
                            unlikely to be available. Total military aid package available to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> worldwide is diminishing, particularly
                            grant aid. Nevertheless, I said I would report Tunisian concerns to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>12. I noted that Tunisian Ministry of Defense has already expressed a
                            serious interest in acquiring A–4M aircraft, which should take care of
                            first requirement cited by President. With regard to effective ground
                            equipment, I said that we had been providing, and were continuing to
                            provide, M48 tanks. These are excellent tanks and almost as good as more
                            modern and more expensive M60 tanks. Re speed boats, I knew that
                            Tunisian Government had already sent out feelers to various governments,
                            including ours, with regard to their purchase.</p>
                        <p>13. I said that while U.S. aid funds for military purposes are limited,
                            we of course stand ready to sell Tunisian arms on a cash basis. It
                            should be kept in mind that there is always a question of priorities,
                            which can sometimes result in delays. In view of improved Tunisian
                            financial resources I wondered whether Tunisia could not rpt not afford
                            to finance most of its new military acquisitions. I suggested to Bibi,
                            Jr. that Tunisian Government also look to its “other friends” for
                            help—for example, to France, Germany and Italy, who are already
                            contributing to Tunisian military establishments. He made no
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>14. Comment:</p>
                        <p>A. While Tunisian Government’s concern with Libyan and Algerian threats
                            is no doubt exaggerated, it is clear that this concern is growing. It
                            was mentioned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> by Foreign Minister Chatti a few weeks ago and
                            it has been mentioned to me by other Tunisian officials, but never
                            before at President and Prime Minister levels. My feeling is that
                            Tunisia has more reason to worry about Libyan subversion than it does
                            about overt Libyan military attack despite developing Soviet military
                            presence in Libya and supposed build-up of Libyan armed forces. I would
                            guess that Algerian threat is considerably more remote. In any case,
                            Tunisia does have grounds for some concern with regard to its Libyan
                            neighbor and important point is that Tunisians are deeply concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="338" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_338"/>
                        <p>B. This concern is no doubt accentuated by Tunisian Government’s
                            realization that its military equipment is almost entirely obsolete.
                            Most of it is World War II or Korean War vintage and as such compares
                            unfavorably with sophisticated weapons being acquired by Tunisia’s
                            neighbors. Newly perceived threat has no doubt focussed Tunisian
                            leadership’s attention on these inadequacies, without, however, causing
                            any basic change in Tunisia’s solidly anti-military cast of thought.</p>
                        <p>C. Another element which may be inducing the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> to press for better military equipment are recent
                            reports that a number of Tunisian officers are complaining. Not
                            surprisingly, they are unhappy with equipment obsolescence. As we have
                            reported, some of the Tunisian support for the Jerba Declaration came
                            from military officers who yearned for the shiny, new weaponry recently
                            introduced into the inventory of the Libyan army. Secretary of State
                            Bennour told Chuslot a few weeks ago that army morale was indeed low and
                            that old-fashioned equipment was the principal reason. We have no
                            evidence that army loyalty for regime has weakened, but this kind of
                            dissatisfaction is not helpful to regime.</p>
                        <p>D. On the basis of all factors mentioned in paras A, B and C above, the
                            Tunisians do make a good case for the need to improve their military
                            posture, especially for deterrent purposes. They are not talking about a
                            major augmentation of military forces, but rather the introduction of
                            certain types of more modern military equipment. With regard needs cited
                            by President Bourguiba, Tunisians have already made a start in direction
                            of purchase of more sophisticated aircraft (A–4M’s) costing some $40
                            million. They will now presumably make an assessment of what more modern
                            ground equipment might be desirable and obtainable to supplement
                            existing M48 and French AMX tanks (on order). It is possible that they
                            will consider asking for <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missiles,
                            and if so, we will have to tell them that line for acquisition is some
                            five year’s long. Tunisians may start thinking in terms of ground to air
                            missiles (Hawks), but it is hard to see how they can realistically
                            expect to incur this additional expense at this point given their
                            apparent undertaking to buy A–4M’s and their limited, albeit improved,
                            financial resources.</p>
                        <p>E. We expect soon to receive bill of particulars from <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> re what it precisely wants. We would
                            guess that in addition to identifying particular type of equipment
                            desired, they will ask for as rapid as possible delivery and more
                            financial assistance. Given the limited financial resources at our
                            disposal, the Tunisians are of course going to have to finance the bulk
                            of the costs of the new equipment. However, I hope that we can be as
                            responsive as possible within our limited resources.</p>
                        <p>F. In anticipation of more specific Tunisian requests, we believe that we
                            should start thinking in terms of following responses:</p>

                                    Libya and Tunisia signed the Djerba Treaty of Unity. Under the
                                    terms of the agreement, Tunisia would hold the Presidency and
                                    Libya would hold the Defense Ministry. Bourgiba pulled out of
                                    the agreement in February.</p></note></head>

                            7659.</p>
                        <p>1. Re para 4 of <gloss target="#t_Reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, we have
                            certainly not seen any comment by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> in which he threatens to bring about unity with
                            Tunisia by force in 1975. First part of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>’s statement is true enough,
                            however. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is indeed
                            continuing to insist Djerba Declaration be implemented. What <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> may be talking about is
                            following statement <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> made
                            at Libya ASU Congress November 6. “Libya has done its utmost to achieve
                            Arab unity. But Arab unity is not at disposition of one side alone it is
                            agreement between several countries. One side cannot do anything unless
                            (unity) is imposed by force, and there is no question of this now”.</p>
                        <p>2. When Bibi, Jr. says rate of attempted infiltration from Libya has been
                            stepped up, we are not at all clear about what he is referring to. There
                            have been SRF reports of Libyan propaganda teams and other Libyan backed
                            subversives in Tunisia, and we assume Bibi, Jr. is talking</p>
                        <p><pb n="340" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_340"/>about these rather than military
                            or paramilitary units which might be conjured up by word infiltration.
                            We have no info which would confirm building of airstrips along
                            border.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree fully with assessment that Tunisia has more to fear from
                            potential Libyan subversion than from military attack. It is difficult
                            to foresee circumstances under which Libya, using Soviet weapons, would
                            invade an Arab neighbor. Some Tunisian nervousness about Libya is
                            obviously understandable, but from Tripoli vantage point Tunisians seem
                            to be overdoing it a bit.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: I bring you greetings from
                            President Bourguiba as well as a statement of his esteem for you, Mr.
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The President: Please express my gratitude to President Bourguiba for his
                            good wishes, my esteem, my hope for his health and my hope that he may
                            visit us soon. Please express to him the feeling of the American
                            people—going back many years—of friendship and appreciation for the
                            moderate policies of Tunisia under his leadership.</p>
                        <p>[Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> comes
                            in.]</p>
                        <p>I know you are meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and will announce the Joint Commission. We
                            think this can be very useful in promoting our joint efforts and your
                            further economic development. We are most grateful for the constructive
                            role that your country has played <pb n="341" facs="0368"
                                xml:id="pg_341"/>in matters relating to the Mediterranean and the
                            Middle East. We hope you can continue to play that role in the period
                            ahead. I would be grateful for your observations.</p>
                        <p>First, may I say that our policy is one of forward movement. We will not
                            tolerate a stalemate and stagnation. We are emphatic in our statements
                            to all the parties that there can be no military action as we search for
                            ways to continue progress.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: I would like first to say
                            that Tunisia has never been a country that favors excesses. We have a
                            long history, and many different civilizations have been in our country,
                            so we have always been open to the outside. We operate not from emotion
                            but from a realistic appraisal of the situation. We are always for
                            dialogue—even during our struggle for independence, we advocated
                            dialogue with our occupying power. That is even more important in the
                            world today. Force is the most abhorrent way to conduct international
                            relations. Since we are a small country, we feel that legitimacy is the
                            most important way to conduct affairs. It is on that that we have our
                            policies toward the Mediterranean, the world and the societies in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>As we look to the situation in the Mediterranean, we see it through
                            Tunisia’s eyes, so it may not include all the data—since all events in
                            the Mediterranean concern us directly. That refers not only to the
                            Middle East proper but also with respect to possible differences with
                            some of our neighbors.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Middle East, our government stands fast regarding the
                            legality which must prevail. All territory gains by force must cease.
                            American policy is a positive policy, though it has not achieved great
                            success.</p>
                        <p>The President: The policy initiated in 1973 we think was successful, and
                            we thought another step would have been useful. But despite that, we
                            feel that movement is essential and we hope the countries of the Middle
                            East share our feeling that progress must continue to be made.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: It is quite so, Mr.
                            President, and the policy of the United States is one which envisages a
                            global solution involving all issues, and we think the problem can’t be
                            solved without including all of the parties—including the Palestinians.
                            So we do believe in a global solution and that is how we understand the
                            American policy. That also we think is President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s policy and that of the others
                            who may seem very reserved on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The President: We do believe a settlement must include the legitimate
                            rights of the Palestinians and we think any agreement must take that
                            full into consideration.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: Wouldn’t it be better and
                            more clear to involve the Palestinians immediately in the process of
                            seeking a solution?</p>
                        <pb n="342" facs="0369" xml:id="pg_342"/>
                        <p>The President: I know this is the policy of a number of countries like
                            yourselves, but until we see how those rights fit into the overall
                            structure, I don’t think we should commit ourselves at this time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As the Prime
                            Minister has undoubtedly noticed, we have an extreme domestic problem
                            when we deal with the Middle East. As you must have noticed, this is the
                            first President at least since 1956 who has publicly taken a position of
                            some dissociation from Israel. If we now get involved with the issue of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> at this stage, it would
                            undermine our efforts, because the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                            is still considered here as a terrorist organization. If we deal first
                            with the border and territorial problems, the Palestinian problem will
                            then fall into line. The Israeli strategy is to produce a stalemate and
                            push the issue into our election year. The more confused the situation
                            is, the more it facilitates that. This is why the President has
                            emphasized that we will tolerate no stalemate.</p>
                        <p>The President: It would be very disruptive to have anything going on
                            during an election in the United States.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: It seems to be a problem
                            of procedure, not of substance.</p>
                        <p>The President: I wouldn’t put it so simply. I think it is mandatory to
                            keep it moving both as to time and substance. Any delay invites military
                            activity, and we are trying to keep things moving. There are issues of
                            substance but you can’t get to them until you get negotiations
                            going.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: This negotiating process
                            has been started by the disengagement process. The disengagement allowed
                            a direct dialogue with Egypt and a less direct dialogue with Syria . . .
                            .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Every dialogue with
                            Syria is direct.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: This could be considered
                            as a continuing dialogue, and the Palestinians could be brought in
                            somewhere along the line. They can’t be ignored forever.</p>
                        <p>The President: We recognize their rights, but don’t believe we can take
                            that on at the outset, but it must evolve as other things are settled
                            first.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: It seems to me that the
                            Arabs have not voiced reservations about continuing the dialogue with
                            respect to bringing in the Palestinian question.</p>
                        <p>The President: This is a matter of great significance to Israel and the
                            refusal of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> to recognize Israel
                            complicates things considerably. And it is my judgment that the issue
                            can best be brought in in the context of a comprehensive settlement with
                            peace being the objective.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: I realize that the
                            ultimate goal is peace, but the matter of recognition of Israel by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> is more formal than real. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> doesn’t deny the existence of
                            Israel, but if Israel doesn’t recognize the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss>, why should the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                            recognize Israel? Can’t we somehow cut this Gordian knot?</p>

                        <p>The President: I can assure you we will carefully consider your thought.
                            We hope we can complete our assessment soon and be ready to move
                            forward, because we think movement is essential and we must have the
                            parties avoid the resort to force.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: It is a wise and laudable
                            policy, and I think the U.S. Government has the dimension and weight to
                            solve the problem. I realize you can’t solve it by waving a wand, but I
                            know you will continue what you can.</p>
                        <p>The President: I know you are concerned about your security. I want you
                            to know that despite the Congressional cuts, we will do whatever we can
                            to assist with training and equipment. Congress has cut the grant aid
                            badly, but we will try through sales to help you to the best of our
                            ability.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: I appreciate your
                            comments. Tunisia has never been fond of arms because we believe the
                            first defense is at home. So we are trying to raise the standard of
                            living, so we are trying to provide jobs so that young men will have
                            something worth defending. But others are arming more than necessary and
                            we wonder why. We would rather use your aid to raise our living
                            standards, but we would like to be able to defend ourselves while we are
                            developing. Our army stays in the barracks, but others don’t, and that
                            concerns us.</p>
                        <p>We attach the greatest importance to development and we want to thank you
                            for the American efforts to help us. Since our independence, we have
                            gotten a third of all our assistance from the United States. We have
                            made a great effort, and now we think we are in a pre-takeoff phase.
                            Takeoff is estimated at about 1981. When an aircraft takes off, it needs
                            extra power, and we hope the United States will give us help in reaching
                            cruising speed in our development.</p>
                        <p>The President: As you know, I must work with the Congress in getting
                            authority, but I will do what I can to assist you in your takeoff. You
                            will be speaking to Congressmen and I think you should emphasize this
                            point to them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: I feel encouraged by your
                            words, and they will give me courage when I meet with the Congressmen.
                            Tunisia has been making great efforts. In our Fourth Plan, outside aid
                            was 40 percent; then in the Fifth it went to 24 percent and now it is at
                            17 percent. We don’t want to break our stride, and I will stress this to
                            the Congress.</p>
                        <p>President: I hope you will stimulate private investment. It is the best
                            in our country, and I think it will help keep your momentum.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>: That is exactly what we
                            are doing. The contributing of the private sector has doubled over ten
                            years—from 20 percent to 45 percent.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: Yes, Alec is
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: I am very happy to be here.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It is a pleasure for me to see you again.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: Shall we discuss our bilateral relationship
                            first and then international issues, especially the Middle East and
                            where we go from here.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That is fine with me.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: I would like to talk about our economic
                            relationship first, especially the Joint Commission. It is very
                            important for us and we are pleased that you are sending an important
                            delegation for the first meeting which will take place in Tunis on
                            October 20. We very much hope Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> can come as part of your
                            delegation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Roy, are you going?</p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="0372" xml:id="pg_345"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: I have told the
                            Minister that I very much want to come and I will be there unless I am
                            tied up with the Middle East negotiations. That is one reservation I
                            have made on my attendance. In any event, Under Secretary Robinson will
                            be there as the head of our delegation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Don’t show him a port. He is a fanatic on ports and if you
                            show him one he will immediately give you a plan for rebuilding it.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: We need two things from the U.S., greater
                            cooperation in meeting our defense needs and with economic matters. The
                            defense questions will not come up in the Joint Commission, but the
                            economic matters will. I hope your delegation will have precise
                            instructions so that we can discuss with them just how much assistance
                            we will be able to get from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We will be sure they are instructed to give you precise
                            answers as to what we can do for Tunisia and that they will have the
                            answers at the time of the Joint Committee meeting. Is that what you
                            want?</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: Yes. I also wish to raise the defense questions
                            with you. You are giving us loans but they are on commercial terms.
                            Therefore, they are not too favorable for us and we would like to
                            improve the conditions. Perhaps if part of the credit which you are
                            giving us could be in the form of grant rather than loan it would enable
                            us to lower the interest rate on the total amount and ease our
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do we have any <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> for
                            Tunisia?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: We have not had any
                            for two years.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Why is this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: It is due to our
                            Congress which has been steadily cutting back the overall amount of
                            grant military assistance available for the whole world. It has nothing
                            to do with Tunisia, per se.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The idea of the Foreign Minister about our giving some
                            part of our military assistance credits as a grant in order to reduce
                            the overall interest rate is a good one. Can we do something about
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>: We have already
                            been discussing this suggestion with the Tunisians and we understand it.
                            However, it is going to be tough to get Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Chatti: We should not go into detail on our economic
                            relationship but our collaborators should be able to do this when the
                            Joint Commission meets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That is very good. You instruct your collaborators and we
                            will be sure that our position is fully elaborated and that our
                            delegation has precise instructions for the meeting in Tunis.</p>

                            Subject: <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>’s Concern re
                            Tunisia. Ref: State 24958, State 24957, Tunis 43, State 24935.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary: Tunisian concern with Libyan/Algerian threat has grown over
                            past eighteen months. Current Algierian anti-<gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> propaganda resulting from Sahara controversy sharpens
                            concern, perhaps especially for Chatti whom Algerians blame. But unlike
                            some other <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> officials, Chatti has
                            not emphasized concern to me. Tunisia is rebuilding ties with Egypt as
                            counterpoise to hostile neighbors, and Chatti understandably confided in
                                <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> in order capitalize on
                            close U.S.-Egyptian dialogue. However, believe Chatti would also make
                            same points with me if he deeply worried. <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> has reacted to threat by requesting increased arms
                            purchases from us to achieve modest deterrent capability, but for mix of
                            reasons <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> has not made major
                            purchases. Interior Minister sees threat as political, and military.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> tactic re Algerian propaganda
                            attacks is to turn other cheek. Proposed <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> increase in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credits is direct response to <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            concern and we have offered sell aircraft and <gloss target="#t_SAM_1"
                                >SAM</gloss> systems. Sixth Fleet continues satisfactory visit
                            schedule contributing to Bourguiba’s belief in fleet as his “shield.”
                            Deterrent value of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            possible belief in <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> commitment to
                            Tunisia’s defense may have weakened recently in wake of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> setbacks overseas. Continued
                            demonstration of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest in
                            Tunisian needs provides psychological reassurance to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> regime and hopefully has deterrent
                            value with regime’s enemies. Probable resumption of PL–480 shipment,
                            fruitful joint commission meeting, and continuing modest aid program are
                            therefore welcome. Basically we think Libyan/Algerian threat is
                            non-military and, while <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> has reason
                            to improve its deterrent capability, its main focus should remain on
                            strengthening civilian institutions and capacity to frustrate
                            subversion. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Tunisia’s concern with current and potential threats from both Libya
                            and Algeria has been growing over the past year and a half. Although
                            Tunisian Government has been proclaiming publicly that its re<pb n="347"
                                facs="0374" xml:id="pg_347"/>lations with its two neighbors continue
                            to be cordial, certain Tunisian officials have conveyed to me
                            confidentially their apprehension over the immediate threat to Tunisia
                            posed by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and the
                            long-term hegemonic aspirations of <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>. Interestingly enough, one of the Tunisian
                            officials who has touched only lightly on this subject during our
                            frequent meetings is <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Chatti.
                            However, recent vehement Algerian press attacks against Tunisia flowing
                            from Tunisian support for Moroccan position on Sahara may be causing
                            Chatti special concern since, as new Algerian Ambassador has confided to
                            me, Algerians blame Chatti for having allegedly “double-crossed them”
                            (75 Tunis 7336). They may have told him as much.</p>
                        <p>3. During my most recent meeting with Chatti on January 20, after his
                            return from seeing <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> in
                            Cairo, Chatti did not repeat not even raise the subject of the threat. I
                            am sure he would have done so had he been deeply worried. He has taken
                            pride in what he considers to be excellent relationship which he has
                            established with you, and for this reason he has not hesitated in the
                            past to ask me to relay messages to you. On other hand, it does not
                            surprise me that Chatti took advantage of meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> to express his concerns. Tunisia,
                            which warmed up to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> only
                            slowly because of residual antagonisms toward Egypt flowing from Nasser
                            days, is turning increasingly toward Egypt as a counterpoise to
                            Tunisia’s uncongenial neighbors. In this context, Chatti could be
                            expected to confide in the Egyptians, and, where U.S. is involved, to
                            seek to capitalize on close and continuing U.S.-Egyptian dialogue.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile, Tunisians are reacting to Libyan-Algerian threat in a
                            number of ways. Initially, they used this threat as basis for request to
                            us a year ago for major increase in arms purchases. While recognizing
                            that they would never be a match for larger and better equipped Libyan
                            and Algerian forces, they have felt the need for more of a military
                            deterrent to delay, at least somewhat, an attacking force pending action
                            (unspecified) by the international community on Tunisia’s behalf. As
                            yet, however, the Tunisians have not made any major new military
                            purchases for at least three reasons: (1) lack of funds; (2) differences
                            of view within the Tunisian leadership as to the political and economic
                            advisability of major military expenditures; and (3) differences of
                            views as to how best to cope with these threats. Minister of Interior,
                            Tahar Belkhodja, told me two weeks ago that in his view Libyan-Algerian
                            threat is essentially political and subversive in nature, rather than
                            military. Therefore, he continued, <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            must concentrate its energies on developing better internal security
                            apparatus and “strengthening the society.” In this connection, and
                            despite my explanation that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can no
                            longer provide assistance to police forces, he has asked that we do what
                            we can to assist in this sphere. German Government has undertaken to
                            provide <pb n="348" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_348"/>technical assistance in
                            strengthening border surveillance capabilities, and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> seems to have increased its
                            surveillance of political opposition figures on assumption that
                            Algerians, in particular, are giving increased aid and comfort to
                            Tunisian opposition leaders in exile. <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> reaction to current Algerian attacks over Tunisian
                            Spanish Sahara policy is to turn the other cheek and not rpt not to
                            respond in kind.</p>
                        <p>5. As Department has noted in State 24935, <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is proposing increase of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credits for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 76 from
                            $5M to $15M. This is in direct response to Tunisian expression of
                            concerns re Libyan-Algerian threat and request for additional <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> military assistance. Our limited
                            capacity to respond has dissapointed Tunisians at a time when we have
                            also terminated our <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> grant aid.
                            Although we have considered sympathetically <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss>’s request to buy a <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss>
                            missile system, as well as interceptor aircraft, we have indirectly
                            discouraged <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> from buying the Hawk
                            system they want. In any case, this system is probably too expensive for
                            them, and we have offered them Chaparral system instead. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> has decided to defer purchase of
                            interceptor aircraft, evidently primarily for budgetary reasons but,
                            also, doubtless, because modern aircraft can be a double-edged weapon if
                            they get into the hands of dissident pilots.</p>
                        <p>6. As the Department has indicated, the Sixth Fleet continues to visit
                            Tunisian ports at the rate of 14–15 visits a year. The flagship of the
                            fleet calls at least once a year and did so last in July 1975. A
                            principal reason why President Bourguiba attaches importance to regular
                            visits of the Sixth Fleet to Tunisia is his firm belief that Sixth Fleet
                            serves as a “shield” to deter and protect him from his enemies. There
                            have been indications, though not recently, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> believes there is a secret
                            Tunisian-American agreement which commits the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to defend Tunisia. This belief, if it still exists,
                            presumably has some deterrent value although <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> setbacks in Vietnam and Angola may have raised
                            questions concerning <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> capability and
                            resolve to act in support of its friends.</p>
                        <p>7. While obviously there is considerable doubt as to whether <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would intervene militarily on Tunisian
                            behalf in event of Algerian or Libyan military attack, we consider it
                            important to continue to demonstrate our interest in Tunisia’s
                            political, military and economic needs. This provides important
                            psychological reassurance to Tunisian regime, which greatly esteems its
                            special relationship with U.S. Hopefully, our involvement here also
                            serves as something of a deterrent to Tunisia’s potential enemies. For
                            this reason, we are pleased at prospect that we may be able to resume PL
                            480, Title I shipments to Tunisia; that our first full-fledged joint
                            commission meeting last October was fruitful; that we intend to continue
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit at increased level over
                            coming years; and <pb n="349" facs="0376" xml:id="pg_349"/>that we
                            continue to maintain economic assistance program, albeit at modest
                            level.</p>
                        <p>8. Fundamentally, we tend to agree with Minister Belkhodja that nature of
                            Libyan-Algerian threat is essentially political and subversive rather
                            than military. While we think that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            has good reason to improve somewhat its military posture, main focus of
                            Tunisian activity in coping with outside threat should be, in our view,
                            to accelerate its efforts to strengthen Tunisian economy and society
                            while at same time enhancing its capability to frustrate subversion
                            mounted against the regime.</p>

                            of results of review of U.S. security and economic assistance policy for
                            Tunisia. At close of meeting, following aide-mémoire was given to
                            Ambassador. (Memcon on meeting will be provided septel.)</p>

                        <p>The Department of State appreciated the frank and candid presentation of
                            the Tunisian Government’s security and development concerns which was
                            outlined in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName>’s
                            meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sisco</persName> on May
                            10.</p>
                        <p>Following this presentation, the Department initiated an in depth review
                            of ways in which the United States Government might be helpful in aiding
                            Tunisia in these times of need.</p>

                        <p>Interim Events</p>
                        <p>The Department of State has been informed that the Government of Tunisia
                            intends to purchase the Chaparral and a number of other defense
                            items.</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Reed, Director of <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss>/AF, and Mr. Roy Betteley, Chief of
                            Europe/Africa Division <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>/DSAA, have
                            recently concluded a three-day visit to Tunis during which Tunisia’s
                            needs were discussed in detail with the Ministry of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense is now preparing price and availability data
                            requested by the Tunisian Government on specific items, including a list
                            of ammunition requirements which was submitted in early May. Some of
                            this has already been forwarded to the Tunisian Government, and it is
                            hoped the remainder will be ready shortly.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Government has requested an increase in projected <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing during <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 70–80 from 75 to 100 million dollars, in
                            order to finance these acquisitions.</p>
                        <p>Results of Review</p>
                        <p>A. Security Assistance—The Department of State has examined Tunisia’s
                            requests (defense requirements and credit needs) and finds them
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State will make every effort to make these requested
                            items available to Tunisia, at the earliest feasible date and at lowest
                            costs permissible under U.S. laws, although delivery dates for most
                            items will not be soon and costs may be higher than expected.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing levels, it
                            is not possible to obtain increases over the current <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 76 amount of 13 million dollars, and
                            Congressional authorization for Tunisia in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 77 has already been requested at this same 15 million
                            dollar level. Legislative action on this request is still pending.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State will seek, however, to have the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            level increased to 25 million dollars if funds become available, and the
                            Department will also seek inter-agency approval to increase the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 78, 79 and 80 planning levels to 25
                            million dollars each year.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State trusts that the Tunisian Government understands
                            the U.S. wishes to be helpful but that the Department can give no firm
                            assurances that the increase in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing can be obtained, or
                            that any given amount of credit will be available during <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 78–80.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the Tunisian Government understands the Department of
                            State cannot make such multi-year commitments, and that this decision to
                            seek increases is the most that can be done at the moment to demonstrate
                            the desire to be responsive to Tunisia’s needs.</p>
                        <pb n="351" facs="0378" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                        <p>The U.S. Government will be pleased to receive at the appropriate time in
                            Washington any military representatives the Tunisian Government might
                            wish to send, and to continue ongoing conversations through the American
                            Embassy in Tunis and the Tunisian Embassy in Washington.</p>
                        <p>A visit of Tunisian Defense officials to Grafenwoehr in the Federal
                            Republic of Germany is now being arranged so that they may observe tank
                            gunnery and <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missile firings.</p>
                        <p>B. Economic Assistance—The Department of State has examined the Tunisian
                            Government’s request for an indication of projected U.S. economic
                            assistance during the period of Tunisia’s next five year development
                            plan. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make such a projection
                            because of the uncertainties of our system of annual appropriations.</p>
                        <p>The following areas have been identified for priority consideration and
                            A.I.D. is actively working with the Tunisian Government in developing
                            programs in the following fields:</p>
                        <p>—Rural development</p>
                        <p>—Agribusiness</p>
                        <p>—Health and nutrition</p>
                        <p>—Family planning</p>
                        <p>—Women in development</p>
                        <p>—Science and technology</p>
                        <p>It should be understood that the sums involved for these projects will
                            not be large and that capital assistance will not be significant in
                            terms of Tunisia’s overall investment needs.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. development assistance program in Tunisia will be oriented to
                            achieving transfer of technology, which in the long range can have a
                            significant impact far beyond the level of expenditures involved.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Mulcahy is in full agreement with this approach, and will
                            coordinate U.S. Government assistance efforts to achieve the maximum
                            benefits possible for Tunisia.</p>

                        <p>Bourguiba: I have a mission with many purposes. First, to present the
                            best wishes of my father, who is the George Washington of his country.
                            Just in May we celebrated our 20th anniversary and you were kind enough
                            to send your number two man, the Vice President.</p>
                        <p>President: I want to welcome you here and thank you for the lovely
                            bicentennial gift.</p>
                        <p>[Photographers took pictures of the gold olive tree.]</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: It has a two-fold meaning. First, the apple tree is the symbol
                            of peace. Then it is also the symbol of continuity.</p>
                        <p>President: It is an exquisite gift.</p>
                        <p>I was pleased to send the Vice President to your anniversary. Our
                            relations are excellent and, so far as I know, we have no issues between
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: That is true. It has not always been fashionable to be
                            pro-American but we have been consistent.</p>
                        <p>President: We greatly appreciate that. I hope your father’s health is
                            better.</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: It is, but he has bad periods. He is 73 years old—and has
                            spent much time in prison. [He described President Bourguiba’s
                            imprisonment, especially during World War II when Hitler had him
                            released in hopes of helping the effort.]</p>
                        <p>President: Are there any issues we should discuss?</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: This was my main purpose in coming here. My talks with

                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has given us by becoming the
                            showcase of development. Our birth rate has gone from 3.5 to 1.6. My
                            father has a very clear project in his mind. I was pleased to see the
                            emphasis here on agro-business. If we don’t over the next five years
                            produce enough to feed the people, the progress of the last 50 years
                            will be wasted.</p>
                        <p>President: What is your chief crop?</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: Cereals, olives, fruit. We are also reforesting. We have a
                            national tree day.</p>
                        <p>Many American banks are now interested in coming to Tunisia, I am proud
                            to say.</p>
                        <p>All this policy of the wisdom of my father is in possible jeopardy
                            because of our neighbors. Libya is ruled by a crackpot. I have met him.
                            He should be in a nut house. This is our short-term danger but very
                            serious. He has acknowledged publicly that he is inciting the people of
                            Tunisia and Egypt to overthrow their leaders.</p>
                        <p>Over the longer term the danger is Algeria. They have inherited the
                            French sense of “grandeur”. They have a concept of a super-Algeria
                            reaching from Senegal to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>We don’t want to endanger our economic development but we have to “keep a
                            stone in our hand.” Unfortunately that stone is expensive.</p>
                        <p>Our overall needs are $1.2 billion over the next five years. I have
                            already been to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They are inhibited by appearing
                            to help opponents of Libya and Algeria. I would appreciate it if you
                            would put a little friendly pressure on them.</p>
                        <p>President: We will certainly do that. We will also look at the military
                            and economic program and do what we can.</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: We need, as a top priority, missiles against tanks and
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Qaddafi has developed a base right on our border—out of an old base.</p>
                        <p>President: We will do our best.</p>
                        <p>Bourguiba: We are the only practicing democracy in the Mediterranean.</p>

                            Libyan Intentions (S/S No. 7615858). Ref: Tunis 5177.</p>
                        <p>1. The Problem</p>
                        <p>Tunisian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName>,
                            in lengthy meeting with Ambassador Mulcahy July 22, expressed alarm over
                            intelligence reports that Tunisia might be <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s next target and made plea for U.S. support in
                            possible forthcoming crisis. Mulcahy proposes four courses of action
                            involving deployment of Sixth Fleet units, aerial reconnaissance and
                            intelligence cooperation and requests Department’s urgent response.</p>
                        <p>2. Background/Analysis</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> told Mulcahy that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> had received new indications of <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> measures to increase its arms
                            buildup at newly-opened airbase near Tunisian border. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> suspects <gloss target="#t_LARG_1"
                                >LARG</gloss> will simultaneously stage border incidents, renew
                            propaganda war and launch terrorist actions directed at tourist centers
                            in order to discredit <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> asked what advice or help the
                            U.S. could provide to cope with this threat, and suggested that more
                                <gloss target="#t_USN_1">USN</gloss> ships be sent into Tunisian
                            waters in the next few weeks. Mulcahy commented that the Tunisians seem
                            to have concluded that Tunisia is <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s next target and their concern is amplified by
                            the knowledge that their poorly-equipped defense forces are inadequate
                            to the challenge they face. Alluding to your recent assurances to
                            Bourguiba, Jr. that the U.S. would not forget its friends in difficult
                            times, Mulcahy said that the Tunisians expect some positive gesture of
                            our support in their hour of need. He suggested that we explore four
                            courses of action:</p>
                        <pb n="355" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_355"/>
                        <p>—Extend the Tunis port visit of the USS <hi rend="italic">Barney</hi> and
                            USS <hi rend="italic">Montgomery</hi> (scheduled for July 27–August 2),
                            or alternatively have the ships remain near the Tunisian coast utilizing
                            their air search radar to detect Libyan aircraft incursions.</p>
                        <p>—Arrange another one or two-unit naval visit not later than August 1 to a
                            Southern Tunisian port (Sfax, Gabes, or Djerba) by ships having air
                            search radar capability.</p>
                        <p>—Utilize air reconnaissance by U.S. military aircraft, preferably not
                            based in Tunisia, during the critical early August period.</p>
                        <p>—Make available to the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> maximum
                            intelligence from all sources concerning Libyan activities.</p>
                        <p>The Department has received no intelligence which would support Tunisia’s
                            view that a Libyan attack, clandestine or otherwise, is imminent. On the
                            contrary, Libya according to all reports is concentrating its military
                            buildup on the Egyptian frontier and directing its venom against Egypt
                            and the Sudan. Reportedly the airbase near the Tunisian border is
                            inoperative because of a lack of administrative and operational
                            facilities. Nevertheless, the Tunisians obviously perceive a threat
                            whether it actually exists or not and I believe we should do what we can
                            to reassure them.</p>
                        <p>In the hope we may be able to provide the Tunisians material evidence of
                            our concern and support, we are urgently investigating the possibility
                            of expediting delivery to Tunisia of military equipment budgeted under

                            possible:</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador Mulcahy has reported urgently to me the concerns that you
                            expressed to him on July 22 about Libyan intentions toward Tunisia. In
                            particular, he told me of your request that the U.S. increase its naval
                            presence in Tunisia during the early days of August, which you consider
                            to be the critical period.</p>
                        <pb n="357" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_357"/>
                        <p>5. I want to assure you that, as we have told Tunisia in the past and as
                            I recently reiterated to Habib Bourguiba, Jr., the U.S. is fully
                            prepared to help Tunisia in every way it can. We regard your country as
                            a close and warm friend and one whose security is of importance to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>6. I am looking urgently into the question of naval visits to determine
                            the best way to provide the increased presence you desire. I wanted you
                            to know immediately, however, that we are prepared to help and that we
                            would be in touch with you further, just as rapidly as possible, about
                            the precise steps we will be able to take.</p>
                        <p>7. I send you and President Bourguiba my warmest regards. <persName

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName>: First of
                            all I would like to describe to you the situation in Tunisia with
                            emphasis on our economic situation. U.S. assistance has been declining
                            for a number of years and we have not pressed you on this because we
                            know of your worldwide responsibilities but today the situation has
                            become much more urgent.</p>
                        <p>We have not emphasized this in the past because we had no defense plan
                            and all of our resources went into economic development. <pb n="358"
                                facs="0385" xml:id="pg_358"/>But for about two years now, ever since
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> tried to set up a
                            union with Tunisia and with the Algerians having some designs of their
                            own against Tunisia, we have been forced to make plans for our defense
                            and to assign some of our resources to defense.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia’s resources do not make it possible for us to conduct both
                            development and defense simultaneously. Our resources in oil and
                            phosphates are limited as are also our agricultural resources and we
                            cannot pursue our economic plan and look after our defense as well.
                            Between the Algerians who are ambitious and the Libyans who are crazy we
                            can no longer afford to neglect our defense. We must have some defense
                            and it must be adequate in scope.</p>
                        <p>We have made a study of our defense requirements and our minimum plan
                            calls for $500 million over the next five years. The U.S. has assisted
                            us with the Chaparral and some military credits but these are on
                            commercial terms, 8½ percent over seven years. These are difficult
                            terms. We have received better terms from the French, the Italians and
                            the Yugoslavs. We are aware that your rules require that you operate in
                            this fashion but I am asking you today for two things.</p>
                        <p>First, to restore U.S. military assistance in the form of grants as you
                            used to do in the past where we could always depend on $2–$3 million per
                            year in grants. This would enable us to pay off the interest on some of
                            the loans or it could be given in the form of equipment. The second
                            thing I am asking you to do is to include Tunisia in the supporting
                            assistance program (for security assistance) because of our strategic
                            location. You are doing this for countries like Egypt, Syria, Portugal
                            and you can consider that Portugal is very much like Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>Our philosophy is that the West, in the Mediterranean, begins with
                            Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, and the Sudan and continues with Kuwait and
                            Saudi Arabia and that it is all one single unified front. Any break in
                            any part of the front affects its entirety. Morocco is well equipped
                            militarily; so is Egypt. Saudi Arabia and Iraq also, but not Tunisia who
                            could become a victim of either <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> or the Algerians. Either one of these could call
                            in the army after promoting troubles there. It would then be too late
                            for the U.S. to intervene. We are not seeking U.S. intervention. We seek
                            a 48-hour breathing space until our friends in the Security Council can
                            act. We have information that if it were not for the presence of
                            Egyptian troops on the Libyan border, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> would have initiated action against Tunisia this
                            year. It was on his schedule for this year. If the Libyans cause us some
                            trouble we can offer no military resistance. We are completely exposed,
                            we are forced to equip ourselves and we consider that we are part of the
                            overall strategy of the U.S. We are in the same boat with Saudi Arabia,
                            Morocco and Egypt. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> agrees with me and has told me to take it up with
                            you. He will discuss this with you himself he said. We have asked Egypt
                            to help us <pb n="359" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_359"/>and they have agreed
                            to lend us some equipment. From the strategic aspect we constitute the
                            weakest link in that unified front and if anything happened to Tunisia
                            it would then be too late. That is why I ask for inclusion of Tunisia in
                            the support assistance program to which we are entitled to the same
                            degree as are Portugal and Spain though not as much as entitled as
                            Egypt. But those are countries that you are seeking to strengthen to
                            ensure their security. I ask you to please reflect on this.</p>
                        <p>But the question of granting aid is most urgent, aid in the form of
                            military equipment or of funds to cover the costs of the loans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: First of all I agree completely with the strategic concept
                            you have outlined that starting from Morocco through Tunisia, Egypt and
                            to Saudi Arabia it is all one unit and that Tunisia constitutes the
                            weakest link because it has powerful neighbors and inadequate resources
                            and that therefore Tunisia needs aid.</p>
                        <p>The problem is what we can do given Congressional restraints and that is
                            a matter I must look into. There is considerable resistance to grants
                            but it is not impossible to overcome it. Considering including Tunisia
                            under support assistance is a question that I must take up with the
                            President, with the Bureau of Budget and with Congress. I am sympathetic
                            and would like to make this possible.</p>
                        <p>But now we must wait until after the election, assuming that we are
                            elected we will then consider it seriously and will do so by the end of
                            November. We will look at the situation.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName>: President
                            Bourguiba has asked me to convince you of the importance of this and I
                            am pleased to hear that you are sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes I am, and we shall do what we can. I suggest that we
                            now go upstairs and join the others.</p>

                        <p>Acting Secretary of State Robinson recommends that you make a
                            Determination that it is important to the national security of the
                            United States to utilize Foreign Military Sales (<gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>) guaranties to finance the sale to
                            Tunisia of a sophisticated weapon system, specifically a Chaparral air
                            defense missile system (Tab B). Section 4 of the Arms Export Control Act
                            prohibits the use of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing for
                            the sale of sophisticated weapons systems, including missile systems, to
                            underdeveloped countries such as Tunisia in the absence of a
                            Presidential Determination. A proposed Determination and justification
                            are at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>Providing Tunisia with the Chaparral system will enable that country to
                            improve its defensive capabilities vis-à-vis Libya and Algeria. <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing of this sale will allow
                            Tunisia to meet its security requirements without diverting resources
                            currently allocated to important economic development projects. Congress
                            was formally notified of this proposed sale on September 10, 1976, and
                            no objection was interposed during the 30-day review period.</p>
                        <p>Max Friedersdorf and Jack Marsh concur in this recommendation, as does
                                <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> (Tab C).</p>

                        <p rend="center">JUSTIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION TO PERMIT THE
                            SALE OF A SOPHISTICATED WEAPON SYSTEM TO TUNISIA</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem:</p>
                        <p>Section 4 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended (the Act), prohibits
                            the use of funds authorized under the Act “to guarantee, or extend
                            credit, or participate in an extension of credit in connection with any
                            sale of sophisticated weapons systems, such as missile systems and jet
                            aircraft for military purposes, to any underdeveloped country” with
                            certain exceptions not relevant here. For the purposes of the Act,
                            Tunisia is an “underdeveloped” country. The Government of Tunisia wishes
                            to finance the purchase of the Chaparral missile system with a loan
                            guaranteed by the United States under Section 24 of the Act.</p>
                        <p>Section 4 of the Act authorizes the President to waive the prohibition
                            described above if he determines that such financing is important to the
                            national security of the United States and reports each such
                            determination to the Congress within thirty days.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Justification:</p>
                        <p>Tunisia is a politically moderate Arab state with traditionally close
                            relations with the United States. Tunisia permits port visits by <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Navy ships, thereby adding to the
                            operational effectiveness of our naval forces in the southern
                            Mediterranean. The maintenance of an independent and moderate-oriented
                            Tunisia is important to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> goal of
                            regional stability in North Africa. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            foreign military sales to Tunisia enable that friendly Arab government
                            to improve its defenses against hostile neighboring states equipped with
                            sophisticated Soviet weapons. The interference of Libya in the internal
                            affairs of Tunisia and other countries has caused Tunisia to seek to
                            improve her defensive capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia has requested the purchase of the Chaparral missile system to
                            meet her air defense needs. The Executive Branch submitted to the
                            Congress formal notification of this proposed sale under the provisions
                            of Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, on
                            September 10, 1976. The cost of the Chaparral missile system sale under
                            consideration is about $43.5 million. It would be difficult for Tunisia
                            to acquire this needed air defense capability without foreign military
                                <pb n="362" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_362"/>sales (<gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>) financing if it is to avoid the
                            diversion of its resources from important economic development projects.
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing of the Tunisian
                            purchase of the Chaparral missile system will contribute significantly
                            to Tunisia’s ability to deter threats against its security and to
                            continue to exercise a moderating influence in the region. Our
                            substantial political and military interests in the southern
                            Mediterranean would be jeopardized by a deterioration in regional
                            stability or a diminution in the forces of moderation in North Africa.
                            Therefore, the use of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> guaranties
                            under section 24 of the Arms Export Control Act to finance this sale is
                            important to the national security of the United States.</p>
